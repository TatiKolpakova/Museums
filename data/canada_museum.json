Some are tragic, evoking painful memories and complex emotions. One such event is the 1970 October Crisis.\nIt all started in Montr\u00e9al on October\u202f5. A violent, socialist, pro-independence movement, the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ, Quebec Liberation Front), kidnapped James Cross, the British Trade Commissioner. It was the first politically motivated kidnapping in the history of North America. The kidnappers made several demands, including that their manifesto be broadcast on the national French television network, Radio-Canada. Wanting to buy time, the federal government agreed, and the manifesto was read by announcer Ga\u00e9tan Montreuil. The raw, implacable wording of the manifesto crystallized opinions on all sides.\nOn October\u202f10, there was a sudden turn of events. Another FLQ cell abducted Quebec\u2019s deputy premier, Pierre Laporte, in front of his home on Montr\u00e9al\u2019s South Shore. What was a crisis turned into a national drama. Fear gripped the nation, and for good reason.\nOn October\u202f15, the federal government sent 8,000 soldiers to Quebec to restore order, particularly in Montr\u00e9al. For several years, the city had been in turmoil due to bombings, illegal strikes and turbulent demonstrations. Its mayor, Jean Drapeau, and the city\u2019s police force were overwhelmed and feared the worst.\nAt 4\u202fa.m. on October 16, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau made a grave decision. At the request of Quebec\u2019s premier, Robert Bourassa, and Mayor Drapeau, he issued a decree invoking the War Measures Act \u2014 powerful legislation that had never been enforced in times of peace. The Act gave the police extensive powers. About 500 people were imprisoned, and the police conducted 31,000 searches.\nLate the next day, the FLQ counterattacked. Laporte\u2019s body was found in the trunk of a car, which had been parked on a federal air force base as a gesture of defiance. It was the first political assassination in Canada since the murder of Thomas D\u2019Arcy McGee in 1868. In the weeks that followed, the crisis wound down as the kidnappers were captured, the vast majority of the suspects were freed and, fortunately, James Cross was liberated.\nThe October Crisis is 50 years in the past, but in many ways it is still controversial. Could the drama have been avoided, or handled differently? We will never know for certain. By taking a deeper look at the Museum\u2019s collections, we can explore the dramatic events of October\u202f1970 through the experiences of several key figures.\nTo learn more, read the Museum\u2019s blog post, The October Crisis: A Personal Experience.\nThe first page of the Manifeste du FLQ (the FLQ\u2019s manifesto), broadcast on Radio-Canada in October\u202f1970.

The pages of Pier 21: A History are filled with smiles, captured where the stories of many Canadians began \u2014 smiles that had often been erased in times of trouble, elsewhere in the world.\nA collaboration between the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 and the Canadian Museum of History, this richly illustrated edition is the latest in the Mercury Series, published in English and French by the University of Ottawa Press.\n\nPier 21 is more than the history of an ocean immigration facility. It is the suitcases, family names and stories of almost a million people, who arrived between 1928 and 1971 and helped shape Canada\u2019s population. It is also the story of our military personnel \u2014 400,000 men and women who returned from Europe after the Second World War \u2014 and the story of young orphans, Red Cross volunteers, prisoners of war, immigration officers\u2026\n\u201c[The] memories of Pier 21 are wide-ranging: the ship\u2019s arrival, the assembly room, the small-baggage check, the confiscated goods, the Canadian food, boarding the train, and the waiting, uncertainty and anticipation.

They discussed a wide range of topics such as the art of play, creative learning, the 21st-century family, inclusivity, and accessibility. Selected students from Carleton University and McMaster University were invited to participate in poster sessions to showcase their research and other initiatives related to these themes.\nSymposium on Family Learning, Inclusion and the Value of Play in Museums, held on December 4 and 5, 2019 at the Canadian Museum of History.\n\u201cIt was the Children\u2019s Museum team\u2019s first experience organizing a symposium of this kind, so we weren\u2019t sure what to expect,\u201d said Chantal Amyot, Director of Exhibitions and Visitor Experience at the Canadian Museum of History. \u201cWe took a bit of a chance with our format, starting with presenting some very big ideas, then exploring how these big ideas could be actionable, but it worked\u201d.\n\u201cWe were extremely pleased with the quality and variety of the speakers and thrilled to see how engaged everyone was in conversations. Participants were so eager to listen to new perspectives while sharing their own experiences. It\u2019s amazing how all the subjects intertwined and complemented each other.\u201d\nThe presentations explored the evolution of the museum experience and examined the most effective means of engaging all children and families in meaningful ways, by encouraging creativity, problem-solving and sharing, while helping children gain social, emotional and physical skills.\nKey speakers included Dr.\u00a0Peter Gray, author of Free to Learn and an expert on the role of play in human evolution, who spoke about how children\u2019s time to play freely has been reduced so drastically that it has affected how they learn and build their skills. Patrice Aubertin of the National Circus School offered insight into physical development and the importance of risk-taking.\nDr. Peter Gray, author of Free to Learn\nJason Nolan, Director of the Responsive Ecologies Lab (Re/Lab), at Ryerson University in Toronto, brought a unique perspective as a person with autism whose research focuses on designing tools and technologies to support children\u2019s learning in informal settings. He spoke about \u201cchildism\u201d, the assumption that children are inherently inferior to adults, and the importance of seeing children as individuals when designing creative spaces that fit their needs.\nPaul Bowers, the former Head of Exhibitions at Museums Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, shared his ideas for developing new museum experiences. He later wrote in a blog post: \u201cWhat evolved over the course of the symposium was a greater understanding and appreciation of the work that goes into designing playful and inclusive experiences for young people, both within the realm of children\u2019s museums and beyond.\u201d\nFor the Canadian Museum of History staff, the conference was a valuable opportunity to share best practices gleaned from three decades of operating a successful children\u2019s museum, while welcoming outside expertise to inform and inspire the renewal of the Children\u2019s Museum, ensuring exceptional experiences for families for years to come.\n\u201cOur whole core team was there, along with some members of the extended team and the designers \u2014 including Laurent Carrier of Toboggan Design in Montreal, who was also one of the presenters,\u201d Amyot said. \u201cNow, as we plan the renewal of the Canadian Children\u2019s Museum, we\u2019re all on the same wavelength, and we can refer very easily back to these talks. We met shortly after the symposium, and already we were applying new knowledge and ideas, not just for the ideas and content of the museum, but the physical space as well.\u201d\nStudent Poster Sessions during the Symposium.\nThe symposium followed months of outreach efforts to guide the renewal, including consultations with stakeholder groups, employees and experts, extensive public surveys, and Museum activities in which hundreds of children and families shared their ideas and feedback.\nAs the renewal progresses, the Children\u2019s Museum will remain open in its current configuration until September 2020. From October 2020 until the project\u2019s completion in December of 2021, an exciting new temporary space will open, with many modules from the present Children\u2019s Museum, as well as a dynamic lineup of special exhibitions, activities and programs for families.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/when-cree-and-inuit-transformed-modern-canada/", "category": "Significant Dates", "title": "When Cree and Inuit Transformed Modern Canada", "author": "Pierre M.

The decision forced the Quebec government to interrupt construction of hydroelectric dams at James Bay, and to negotiate.\nThe ruling was greeted with astonishment and with consternation in some cases. It was viewed by some as an aberration. Others saw it as a stroke of genius, empathizing readily with the victims of this major project. One thing is certain: the earth began to shift, setting off a seismic wave previously unlikely on the Canadian Shield.\nThe decision of Jean Chr\u00e9tien, federal Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, to grant Indigenous Peoples a subsidy to help with their defence was not applauded by everyone, but it certainly benefitted the plaintiffs. And, after numerous twists and turns, an agreement was signed on November 11, 1975: the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement (JBNQA). It was a heroic tour de force through which Cree and Inuit would change the course of Canadian history.\nUp: The signing of the James Bay Agreement.

Moses\nBut let\u2019s take a step back. In April 1971, Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa surprised everyone when he announced the \u201cproject of the century,\u201d the most ambitious hydroelectric network ever to be built in the Western world. The proposed project was driven by a passion for progress, the pride of a people, a shortage of energy and the promise of 100,000 jobs \u2014 who would dare to face down this juggernaut? Was it an act of courage or folly? As summed up so well in the title of the book by Zebedee Nungak, it was a struggle against colonialism run amok: Wrestling with Colonialism on Steroids: Quebec Inuit Fight for Their Homeland (V\u00e9hicule Press, 2017).\nThis is why, at the beginning of the saga, no one could have predicted that a group of young Cree and Inuit \u2014 representing barely 9,000 people \u2014 would be able to convince the government to sign the first modern treaty in North America constituting a settlement between Indigenous Peoples and a government. A mere few years earlier, this had been a distant reality in Canada.\n\u201cIn 1969, as a government employee, they moved me to Kangiqsualujjuaq. I wrote a letter to John Diefenbaker, the opposition leader in Parliament. I was summoned to Ottawa. Up there, the government people told me I had no rights. They said only one person should represent Inuit: Bishop Donald Marsh, \u2018Donald of the Arctic.\u2019 Only a white man had the right to speak for the Inuit.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Senator Charlie Watt, signatory to the JBNQA. Source: Napagunnaqullusi (So That You Can Stand!)\n\u201cThe governments always told the Cree, \u2018You have no rights; you are squatters.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Grand Chief Billy Diamond, signatory to the JBNQA. Source: Together We Stand Firm\nIf, at the time, this action was seen as resistance to progress, it should be recognized that today it is the exact reverse. The JBNQA was, in reality, a giant step that the country took toward a modern outlook. Not only had the players around the negotiation table evolved, but an entire country had as well. The fallout from the agreement was immeasurable throughout Canada, and perhaps elsewhere in the world.\nAs an archaeologist, I must emphasize how much the JBNQA contributed to the development of a better archaeological ethic. For the first time, Indigenous groups \u2014Cree and Inuit \u2014 would take greater control of their cultural heritage. At the beginning of the 1980s, they became pioneers of a process that is still under way among numerous Indigenous groups in Canada and around the world.\n\u201cUntil now, any archaeologist \u2026 did their thing, then left for the rest of the year, even if the natives weren\u2019t sure what went on. The Inuit should be consulted properly before any work is done on their territory\u2026\n\u201cIn their territory, the Inuit have the right to an overall say and control on anything that will affect them the most, because it is where they make a living \u2014 off the land, although not as totally as they used to.\n\u201cThis signed agreement with Canadian and Quebec governments, in case of Northern Quebec Inuit will undoubtedly give them more say in all aspects of their lives.\u201d\nDaniel Weetaluktuk, 1978.

One of the most outstanding Inuit figures is the highly accomplished Daniel Weetaluktuk, one of Canada\u2019s archaeological pioneers.\nOriginally from Inukjuak (in Nunavik, Northern Quebec), Weetaluktuk holds a number of outstanding achievements.\nIn the 1970s, he became the first Inuk archaeologist in Canada \u2014 and probably the world. He is also seen by many as the father of community archaeology in Canada. This form of archaeology engages local and/or culturally affiliated communities at all stages of a project, from conception through implementation, to communication of its findings. Participants in these types of projects acquire important skills and knowledge, while also gaining an enhanced sense of responsibility when it comes to the protection and promotion of cultural heritage.\nIn 1979, Weetaluktuk was the first Inuk to hire a graduate in archaeology as his assistant. The person in question was none other than archaeologist Jean-Luc Pilon, who recently retired following a long career with the Canadian Museum of History.\u00a0\u201cCharles Martijn introduced me to Daniel and suggested we work together, said Jean-Luc Pilon. In a wonderful reversal of the usual situation where local people are employed to help out southern researchers, I was the assistant. Daniel\u2019s leadership was as gentle as his personality.\u00a0 He understood that archaeology had its demands in order that the results of his work remain legitimate in the eyes of those bound by their \u2018scientific traditions\u2019. Yet he was innovative and respectful of his own traditions in his approaches\u201d.\nLeft: Daniel Weetaluktuk in Cape Garry in 1976. Canadian Museum of History, MS 1219 V9, photo Allen P.

Canadian Museum of History, RbJr-1:198, IMG2008-0215-0030-Dm\nWeetaluktuk, who sadly died in a 1982 accident, certainly left his mark. Today, community archaeology, just as he imagined, has become a common practice throughout Canada. In addition, a museum in Inukjuak bears his name, as does an annual prize presented by the Canadian Archaeological Association that rewards the students who produce the best papers on archaeology.\nIn a 1982 article in the journal Northern Perspectives, Weetaluktuk shared the following vision for archaeological research into Inuit heritage:\n\u201cIf the regular research cannot accommodate Inuit need, then there should be parallel research designs for this purpose. Such designs would allow the Inuit participants to catch up on the research concepts and goals. The parallel does not mean repeating the research, but even if it did it would be worth it because Inuit would be learning something they can then apply for themselves.\u201d\nTo learn more about Weetaluktuk and his work, see his bibliography and his article \u201cCanadian Inuit and Archaeology,\u201d as well as the articles listed below.\nKemp, B. \u201cDaniel Weetaluktuk 1950\u20131982.\u201d Northern Perspectives 10, 6 (1982): 11\u201312 and\u00a0\u201cInuk archaeologist searches for clues to the past.\u201d Igalaaq (June 1982): 7.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/the-official-languages-act-the-early-years-1969-1977/", "category": "Significant Dates", "title": "The Official Languages Act: The Early Years (1969\u20131977)", "author": "Xavier G\u00e9linas", "timestamp": "2019-09-19 00:00:00", "text": "The Official Languages Act, adopted and coming into effect in 1969, was a milestone in Canadian history, but it did not put an end to debates that had endured for more than a century.

The federal government, led by Pierre Elliott Trudeau since 1968, established \u201cFrench Power\u201d \u2014 considerably increasing the number of important positions occupied by Francophones.\nThe first Commissioner of Official Languages, heading up an organization created in 1970 to ensure that the Act was followed, was Keith Spicer \u2014 a young and colourful journalist who promoted bilingualism with humour and energy. To the Commission we owe a board game, issued in 1974, called Oh! Canada. The game would be highly successful \u2014 two million copies were produced \u2014 and invited players to travel the country along a route riddled with pitfalls.\nThe game both reflected and stimulated enthusiasm for bilingualism among certain Canadian youth. In a similar vein, in 1977, an organization called Canadian Parents for French was born, created by Anglophone parents wanting to enrich their children\u2019s personalities and futures by encouraging the teaching of French, and teaching in French.\nUp: Oh!

Canadian Museum of History, 2011.185.5 and 2011.21.207\nBut this progress was often met with resistance. Many other Canadians viewed the policy on official languages with distrust. In Quebec, supporters of nationalism and independence suspected that this might be a ruse to make Quebec bilingual, and to make Franco-Quebecers believe that the country had suddenly become bilingual from sea to sea.\nAmong Anglophone Canadians, on the other hand, the Act was often confused with an obligation to learn French on pain of demotion. \u201cThey are forcing French on us!\u201d was heard in both private and public. A pamphleteer had some success in 1977 with a work bearing the rather alarming title, Bilingual Today, French Tomorrow.\nMutual lack of understanding came to a head with the Gens de l\u2019air crisis in 1975\u20131976. A directive from the Department of Transport had allowed, for the first time, the limited use of French in certain control towers in Quebec. This led to a general outcry among Anglophone pilots, who asserted that English should be the only language used in aviation, even between Francophones in the cockpit, for presumed reasons of security. Humiliated, Francophone pilots responded by creating the Association des Gens de l\u2019air. The crisis was winding down in 1976, but not before the aviation sector was disrupted by a week of strikes, on the eve of the Summer Olympics in Montr\u00e9al.\nEnthusiasm, hostility and many shades of grey lay between these two extremes. The first few years following passage of the Official Languages Act would leave no Canadian indifferent.\nSee also Part 1 \u2013\u00a0The Official Languages Act: A Difficult Birth (1962\u20131969)\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/the-official-languages-act-a-difficult-birth-1962-1969/", "category": "Significant Dates", "title": "The Official Languages Act: A Difficult Birth (1962\u20131969)", "author": "Xavier G\u00e9linas", "timestamp": "2019-09-05 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cThe English and French languages are the official languages of Canada for all purposes of the Parliament and Government of Canada, and possess and enjoy equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all the institutions of the Parliament and Government of Canada.\u201d\n\u2014Excerpt from the Official Languages Act, 1969\nAt the time of Canada\u2019s Confederation in 1867, French language rights were strictly defined: the use of French was permitted in parliamentary debates in Qu\u00e9bec City and Ottawa, federal laws were to be published in both languages, and trials could be held in either language in Quebec and federal courts. It was little indeed, given the considerable proportion of Francophone Canadians.\nThings evolved slowly \u2014 very slowly. For example, postage stamps became bilingual only in 1927, banknotes in 1936, and simultaneous translation wasn\u2019t introduced in the House of Commons until 1959.\nAt the beginning of the 1960s, tempers began to flare. Whether in terms of education, access to public services and civil service positions, or for symbolic recognition, many Francophones felt like second-class citizens in their own country. In Quebec, the Quiet Revolution reflected the discontent of French Canadians (we are not yet speaking of \u201cQuebecers\u201d) in relation to their economic, cultural and political situation.\n\u201cMa\u00eetres chez nous\u2009!\u201d [Masters in our own house!] became the electoral slogan of the Quebec Liberal Party in 1962. Many were also attracted by the option of independence. Anglo-Quebecers were unsettled by this new sense of pride: would their existing rights be threatened?\nOutside Quebec, other Francophone communities were also asserting themselves. In New Brunswick, for example, Acadians were encouraged by the accession of one of their own: Louis Robichaud, who became Premier of the province in 1960.\nIn Ottawa, and among Anglophone Canadians, \u201cWhat does Quebec want?\u201d was a frequent refrain. The country was undergoing a period of redefinition: although many maintained their vision of a country that was essentially British by tradition, language and ethnicity, others dreamed of something more modern, more independent, more flexible, which would better embrace linguistic realities and diverse identities.\nLaurendeau-Dunton Commission\u2019s report in English and French. Canadian Museum of History FC 145 B55 C226 and FC 145 B55 C22614, IMG2019-0230-0002-Dm\nOn January 26, 1962, Andr\u00e9 Laurendeau, Editor-in-Chief of the prestigious daily newspaper Le Devoir, called for a major commission of inquiry on bilingualism and biculturalism to take stock of the situation, once and for all. His words were taken seriously.\nLester B. Pearson\u2019s new government announced the creation of just such a commission in July 1963. Its co-chairs were Andr\u00e9 Laurendeau and Davidson Dunton, President of Carleton University and former Chairman of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. They would be assisted by eight commissioners and an extensive research team.\nFor 93 months, the Commission criss-crossed the country, receiving 400 statements and holding hundreds of hearings\u00a0\u2014 including public meetings and even cocktail parties \u2014 trying to determine the thoughts and opinions of some 20\u00a0million Canadians. The Commission\u2019s members discussed, disagreed, reconciled and submitted a six-volume report calling for more balance between the country\u2019s Anglophones and Francophones.\nThe federal government had already made some important gestures. One of the more notable was the civil service Policy on Bilingualism, presented by Prime Minister Pearson in April 1966 and affirming in principle equality of access for Anglophones and Francophones.\nBut it was the Official Languages Act, from its coming into effect on September 7, 1969, that cemented and gave new momentum to this linguistic restructuring. From that point on, civil servants could work in the language of their choice, wherever numbers justified. More to the point, Canadians from sea to sea would have access to most government services in the language of their choice.\nA new chapter in Canadian history had begun.\nPart 2 \u2013 The Official Languages Act: The Early Years (1969\u20131977)\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/an-archaeology-wonder-moment/", "category": "Museum Research", "title": "An archaeology wonder moment", "author": "Pierre M.

For me, what is most important is how we found it, under what circumstances, and with whom.\nIn 2013, I was excavating an Inuit semi-subterranean sod house on Qikirtajuaq (Smith Island) on the eastern north shore of Hudson Bay (Nunavik, Northern Quebec). The house has since been dated to a little more than 700 years old, corresponding to the first century of the Inuit migration in Eastern Arctic, between AD 1200 and 1300.\nThis was a project that my former colleagues of the Avataq Cultural Institute and I conducted for the community of Akulivik. I was sitting beside Tommy Weetaluktuk, now head of archaeology at the Avataq Cultural Institute, on one of our last excavation days. We were cleaning the stone-paved floor of the house, tired yet satisfied after a long summer of camping and excavation. A sort of bittersweet feeling was in the air \u2026 yes, our work was already over, but we would soon get back to our families and to the comfort of our homes.\nThe sweet silence of the tundra felt like a wonderful refreshing breeze, after we had both devoted several weeks to leading an archaeological field school for the brave students of Tukisiniarvik School. We were fully appreciative of, and were meditating in, that moment: it was neither too hot nor too cool and it brought welcome respite from the mosquitoes. In short, it felt perfect.\nBy accident, I came to notice the presence of objects stuck between the cracks of the paved floor, which had been built with flat stones. I told Tommy, \u201cHey, it would be worth taking time to clean the cracks of the floor.\u201d Tommy\u2019s reply came in the form of a short noise. Difficult to describe, this specific expression may exist only in the North. I understood it as an approbation, meaning \u201cI agree with you, but let\u2019s enjoy the silence.\u201d Appreciating a few moments together in silence is probably one of the most beautiful things about true friendship in Inuit culture.\nTommy Weetaluktuk holding a harpoon head he had just found. Photo: Avataq Cultural Institute\nFive minutes after I had returned to my meditative state, I started hearing a frenetic scraping behind me, and sweeping noises followed by a long silence, which I soon came to understand was astonishment. \u201cThank you so much, Pierre!\u201d I finally heard Tommy saying half-ironically, half-teasing me about my \u201cbrilliant comment\u201d concerning the cracks of the floor. I turned and saw Tommy holding a splendid harpoon head he had found. He held it very gently and respectfully, as though he were holding a newborn baby. No one else could have known the importance of this discovery better than he did; he had just unearthed the best-preserved and oldest Thule-Inuit harpoon head ever found in Nunavik! We captured that magical moment in the picture above.\nThis harpoon head and many other amazing artifacts can now be seen at the Canadian Museum of History until November 3, as part of the exhibition Fragments of Humanity \u2013 Archaeology in Quebec.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/what-makes-us-human/", "category": "Exhibitions", "title": "What makes us human?", "author": "Sylvain Raymond", "timestamp": "2019-07-11 00:00:00", "text": "The exhibition Neanderthal runs until January 26, 2020 at the Canadian Museum of History, and that is its only stop in North America.

But aside from the rare artifacts, the true gems of this multi-faceted exhibition are the recent discoveries about our prehistoric cousins.\nIllustration by Mauro Cutrona.\nThe colonial view of Neanderthals was of knuckle-dragging, club-wielding brutes. Before the advent of digital media, 19th century scientists commissioned painters and other visual artists to render interpretations of scientific thought of the time for lectures and museum exhibits. If we look at L\u2019Homme de N\u00e9andertal, for instance, a bust created by Louis Mascr\u00e9 at the behest of Aim\u00e9 Rutot, the artist depicts a Neanderthal with an expression that lacks intelligence.\nArtistic interpretations such as this put a distance between Neanderthals and us as \u201ccivilized\u201d humans. They also reinforce such ideas as Neanderthals having no art, abstract thinking or attention to detail (which we now know are untrue). The dialogue between art and science, and the dissemination of these reconstructions, spread ideas of the times and created stereotypes that lasted for more than a century.\nThe exhibition Neanderthal presented at the Canadian Museum of History. Photos: Janet Kimber\nWhy Neanderthals disappeared is unknown. There are theories about lack of food or intelligence, or perhaps too much competition with Homo sapiens. In any case, there were five hominid species living on earth at the time of the Neanderthals, and they all ceased to exist except us, modern humans. So, it becomes an existential question: If Neanderthals were around for 300,000 years and couldn\u2019t survive, what will we do differently?\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/community-celebration-of-pitikwahanapiwiyin/", "category": "Spotlight on the National Collection", "title": "Community Celebration of Pitikwahanapiwiyin", "author": "Katie Pollock", "timestamp": "2019-06-28 00:00:00", "text": "Not even a late spring snowstorm could keep the visitors away from the Chief Poundmaker Historical Centre on May 1.

So too has the fact that his actions prevented the death of hundreds of Canadian troops in May 1885. For community members, this exhibition and the exoneration of Pitikwahanapiwiyin will correct the dominant non-indigenous narrative and prioritize Nehiyaw (Cree) oral histories about their leader and community.\nAfter several visits to the Canadian Museum of History, community leaders Floyd Favel and Milton Tootoosis requested that an item from the Museum collection be featured as part of the exoneration celebration of Pitikwahanapiwiyin by the \u00a0Poundmaker Cree Nation. In response to this request, the Museum was honoured to arrange for the week-long loan of this child\u2019s dress, which was made in the community during the early 1950s. Adorned with sequins and beads, the velvet dress was created by See-ascum-ka-poo (Mary Peemee, Mrs. Horsechild, the daughter-in-law of Big Bear) for Marilyn Kasokeo, who were both residents of Poundmaker Cree Nation at the time.\nCanadian Museum of History, V-A-486, D2004-25537\nAfter months of consultation, I boarded a plane bound for Saskatoon, accompanied by the dress for its first visit back to the community in over fifty years.

Floyd and I then transferred it to the beautiful glass case made by the community, where it remained on display for the week.\nMarilyn Kasokeo (right), the original owner, and her niece, Deanne Kasokeo (centre), standing beside the child\u2019s dress with curator Dr. Katie Pollock (left).\nThe dress had many visitors, and when it was officially unveiled at the art exhibition on May 1, we were privileged with a visit from the original owner herself. Marilyn Kasokeo drove from Edmonton with her family to catch a glimpse of the dress she wore as a child, and I was honoured to hear the stories sewn into every seam and attached to every sequin.\nThis arrangement between the Museum and Poundmaker Cree Nation is a critical step forward in building better relationships and models of collaboration with Indigenous communities that are both meaningful and respectful. Just twenty days after the dress and I returned to Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited the community for the official exoneration of Pitikwahanapiwiyin. The gathering, hosted by Poundmaker Cree Nation, brought visitors from across the Northern Great Plains to witness the Prime Minister acknowledge \u201cthat Chief Poundmaker was not a criminal, but someone who worked tirelessly to ensure the survival of his people, and hold the Crown accountable to its obligations as laid out in Treaty 6.\u201d\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/these-boots-were-made-for-working/", "category": "Spotlight on the National Collection", "title": "These boots were made for working", "author": "John Willis", "timestamp": "2019-05-06 00:00:00", "text": "Made in the late 1930s, in a village shoemaker\u2019s shop in the rural county of L\u2019Islet, in Eastern Quebec, these log driver\u2019s boots are made of ox hide.

The sole and heel have metal brads to help reduce wear, but were especially important because they provided better traction on the slick log or shoreline surfaces. The men of the drave did their work at a time of year when the thermometer could and did reach below zero, thus turning movement on a riverbank or a tree trunk into a hazardous exercise indeed.\nCanadian Museum of History, 978.114.46 a-b, IMG2009-0063-0015-Dm\nIn early 20th century traditional logging operations, wood felled during the winter months was hauled by horse to the side of a waterway so that it could be driven (floated) down lakes and rivers in the direction of harbours, sawmills or pulp mills. The lumberjacks laboured through the winter felling and hauling wood.\nThe work of the log drivers (les draveurs) was synonymous with the advent of spring. Come mid-April and May, most lumberjacks retired to the farm for the rest of the season. Not so the draveurs, whose job it was to break up logjams at a rapid or waterfall \u2014 the men prodding or poking at stray logs with long hand-held poles called peaveys, cant hooks or picaroons.\nThe men usually did their work from a small flat-bottomed boat, pointed at both ends, if not from shore. Sometimes they had to get out and walk, run or dance upon the surface of floating wood in the direction of a particular jam. As specified in the Gilles Vigneault song \u201cTit-Paul la Pitoune,\u201d the longer logs (billots) used to make lumber were generally 12 feet (3.66 metres) long; pulpwood logs (known as \u201cpitounes\u201d) were 4 feet (1.22 metres) in length. As you can imagine, keeping your balance on the smaller pitounes was no easy task for the log driver.\nA major log jam on a Quebec river, early 20th century. Archives Canadian Museum of History, Q 2.1.16.LS\nThe backcountry in Eastern Quebec and the Lower St. Lawrence was, by virtue of private arrangements and lease contracts with the Crown, very much the preserve and domain of the logging and pulp and paper companies. They were in charge of cutting operations in these forested domains. They made the lakes, outlets and rivers into an interlocking system through which they could move wood for dozens of kilometres. Come spring, the rivers throughout rural Quebec were full of floating logs. Les draveurs were there to shepherd the logs to their destination.\nTheir work did not stop or begin there. Waterways were prepared for the flottage beforehand: vulnerable or soft riverbanks were reinforced with wood, and such obstructions as rocks were hand lifted or blasted out of the way. In some cases, flumes (les dalles) were built to direct the logs around a large obstacle such as a hydroelectric dam. This was all hard work, requiring strong arms, agile feet and, of course, a good pair of boots.\nToday most pulpwood is hauled to its destination by truck. The institution of the drave, once so important to the industry, is a thing of the past. Yet if you listen carefully, you may hear the echo of a song or traditional melody, announcing the draveur\u2019s time of year.\n\u00c7a commence au fond du lac Br\u00fbl\u00e9,\nAlentour du huit ou dix de mai.\n(\u2026)\nSylvio danse et se d\u00e9hanche,\nComme les dimanches, les soirs de chance,\nRemous qui hurlent, planchers qui roulent,\nParfums qui sao\u00fblent, reste debout.\n(La Drave, F\u00e9lix Leclerc)\nYou might instead imagine the sheer pleasure of a parish girl for whom nothing \u201cpleases her more from her head to her toes\u201d than getting a chance to waltz with the log driver when, of an evening, he comes to town (\u201cLog Driver\u2019s Waltz,\u201d Kate and Anna McGarrigle).\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/gretzky-and-warhol-what-led-to-the-creation-of-the-great-ones-most-famous-portrait/", "category": "Behind the Scenes", "title": "Gretzky and Warhol: What Led to the Creation of The Great One\u2019s Most Famous Portrait?", "author": "Linsday Bilodeau", "timestamp": "2019-04-08 00:00:00", "text": "What do Campbell\u2019s soup, Marilyn Monroe, Wayne Gretzky and boxes of Brillo pads have in common?

This print is one of six images revealed by Warhol in 1983. The six Gretzky paintings were the only pieces Warhol had ever done that featured an athlete. They were commissioned by Frans Wynans, a British Columbia art collector who promised a Wayne Gretzky Warhol painting to a buyer. Almost miraculously, both Warhol and Gretzky agreed to the idea. The pieces were painted in Warhol\u2019s New York studio, and Wynans was in attendance when Gretzky met Warhol for the portrait.\nHockey exhibit, Canadian Museum of History\nAccording to the stories that Wynans shared, a series of events almost prevented the artworks from being completed. First, Gretzky was three hours late because he got stuck in traffic on the way to the studio, and Wynans and Warhol thought he wasn\u2019t going to show. When Gretzky eventually arrived to sit for the piece, neither of them had a hockey stick available for the portrait. Luckily, Wynans had noticed a sports store across the street from the studio, so he hurried over and asked to borrow a stick. When Wynans explained that it was for a portrait Andy Warhol was creating of Wayne Gretzky, and that these famous men were waiting across the street, the store workers were skeptical. Wynans had to bring Gretzky outside to prove that he was really there and did need a stick for a portrait by Andy Warhol. Finally, they were granted the stick, and Gretzky could sit for the portrait, hockey stick in hand.\nAt the time he met Gretzky, Warhol had returned to his roots, making newspaper advertisements. In the same period, he worked with artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Francesco Clemente and Keith Haring \u2014 all important figures in the art world. These partnerships continued his interest in collaborative work, which he had developed and experimented with at the height of his factory era, setting a foundation for his later works, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This was Warhol\u2019s most prolific period, during which he created more artworks than he had in the rest of his years combined.\nHockey exhibit, Canadian Museum of History\nAt this time, Warhol became interested in the concept of art and value, and this was explored through all his works, including his pop art prints, films and sculptures (e.g., Brillo Box). He was also interested in celebrities including Marilyn Monroe and John Lennon, and politicians like Mao Zedong and Ronald Reagan. Warhol explored the ideas of fame and power, and the ways they are gained, and used. Gretzky was one of these celebrity subjects \u2014 a man of great fame, success and power in the hockey world \u2014 though he was only in his early twenties at the time.\nWhen the Gretzky portraits were revealed in 1983, they were quickly bought by art collectors from around the world, both because they featured a renowned contemporary athlete and because they had the prestige of being Warhol pieces.\nThis Gretzky was featured in the Canadian Museum of History\u2019s Hockey exhibition; a version of this exhibit is currently travelling throughout Canada.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/flying-mallard/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Flying mallard", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-03-31 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 2007.220.1, IMG2009-0063-0121-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/birchbark-basket/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Birchbark basket", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-03-24 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, III-L-11, IMG2019-0027-0002-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/turtle-amulet-or-figurine/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Turtle amulet or figurine", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-03-17 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, VIII-F: 19841, IMG2008-0583-0257-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/artifact-of-the-week-oscar-synthesizer/", "category": "Collection", "title": "OSCar synthesizer", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-03-10 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 2007.140.42.2, IMG2009-0135-0025-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/tyara-maskette/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Tyara Maskette", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-03-03 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, KbFk-7:308, IMG2008-0215-0008-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/museum-closure-week-more-than-just-an-annual-cleaning/", "category": "Behind the Scenes", "title": "Museum Closure Week: More Than Just an Annual Cleaning", "author": "Ga\u00eblle Mollen", "timestamp": "2019-02-26 00:00:00", "text": "This year we celebrate the 26th year of the RBC Indigenous Internship Program (formerly known as the RBC Aboriginal Training Program in museum practices).

Graduates have become role models in their communities and have participated in the promotion of the museological and cultural sectors.\nThe Museum\u2019s annual maintenance week is one of the most interesting aspects of the internship. The interns get to learn more about the various roles of conservators, all while participating directly in the maintenance of the Museum.\nBelow are some insights that this year\u2019s interns provided about their experiences during the Museum\u2019s closure week.\nKoleka\u2019s experience\nDuring the Museum\u2019s closure week, I had the opportunity to go behind the scenes to assist with the cleaning and maintenance of artifacts on display.\nI worked with Emily (one of the textile conservators). At the start, we were cleaning sections of the First Peoples Hall with Dominique and Jenny. We wore lab coats, masks and gloves to protect ourselves, our clothes and the artifacts. In most cases it was an option, however, I usually wore them.\nIn the beginning, I was very nervous about being so close to the artifacts, but I became more confident and comfortable. Emily and Dominique were very helpful and made me feel at ease asking questions. In my opinion, this was probably my favourite experience so far; I really enjoyed myself and the people I got to work with.\n\u201cDuring the Museum\u2019s closure week, I had the opportunity to go behind the scenes to assist with the cleaning and maintenance of artifacts on display.\u201d \u2013 Koleka, intern, RBC Indigenous Internship Program\nJenny\u2019s experience\nI went into the closure week at the Museum a bit apprehensive, knowing that I would be cleaning precious artifacts, but the days went by quickly and it was fun. I worked alongside Emily and Dominique from Conservation, and Koleka in the First Peoples Hall. It was nerve-racking, but the four of us ended up working together in the exhibition displays, which I found made it more fun. It was a great experience to see what Conservation must do, and how meticulously and delicately they worked with the artifacts.\nI knew that a certain type of handling must be done when working with artifacts, but it was fun to be a part of it. If asked my favourite part of the week, I don\u2019t have one \u2014 I\u00a0enjoyed all of it and the physical aspect of it.\n\u201cI knew that a certain type of handling must be done when working with artifacts, but it was fun to be a part of it.\u201d \u2013 Jenny, Intern, RBC Indigenous Internship Program\nAriane\u2019s experience\nBeing able to participate in the cleaning of the Grand Hall was a wonderful experience. I\u00a0was able to help dust totem poles, the Spirit of Haida Gwaii, and a canoe painted by my great-great-grandfather, Charles Edenshaw. Such experiences wouldn\u2019t be available to me on just any regular day, so I felt very lucky to do this.\nThis internship has provided me with opportunities to closely study objects and pieces from my own community and nation, from small objects like tools or baskets, to bigger objects like totem poles and canoes. I think that cleaning the objects on display is very important, not just for the objects or the Museum, but for the energies and spirits of the people who created these pieces; and it may bring more energy into them for the upcoming year. I hope that when the Museum opens again, people may appreciate the time it takes to preserve the life and quality of these pieces for future visits.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/foot-warmer/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Foot warmer", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-02-24 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 77-153, IMG2013-0142-0002-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/the-spear-points-made-by-canadas-first-peoples/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Projectile point", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-02-17 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, VIII-D:58, IMG2008-0583-0270-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/this-type-of-valentines-day-card-was-introduced-in-the-early-1900s/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Valentine\u2019s Day card", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-02-10 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 2011.P0008.37, IMG2015-0002-0001-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/modern-gladiator-how-georges-st-pierre-has-shaped-sport/", "category": "Spotlight on the National Collection", "title": "Modern Gladiator: How Georges St-Pierre Has Shaped Sport", "author": "Jenny Ellison", "timestamp": "2019-02-08 00:00:00", "text": "Georges St-Pierre won this belt at the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) 94 in 2009. It was the first match where two UFC titleholders faced off \u2014 St-Pierre, then the Welterweight Champion, and B. J. Penn, then the Lightweight Champion. St-Pierre defeated Penn in four rounds. The belt evokes the spectacle of ultimate fighting itself: it is oversized, solid and a little bit flashy. It also represents recent transformations in Canadian fitness practices that St-Pierre has helped to inspire: the rise of mixed martial arts (MMA), extreme sports and cross-training.\nCanadian Museum of History, 2018.143.3a-b\nGrowing up in Saint-Isidore, Quebec, St-Pierre (known as \u201cGSP\u201d and \u201cRush\u201d) often struggled. As a child, he had to have major surgery to deal with kidney problems. He was bullied at school, ranging from having his lunch money stolen to his \u201ctear-away\u201d pants ripped off. Initially, St-Pierre took to fighting to defend himself. After seeing Royce Gracie win UFC 1 in 1993, he became fascinated by MMA. At 17, St-Pierre travelled to New York City to train at Gracie\u2019s gym. He spoke no English at the time but impressed the coaches with his athleticism and discipline. Today, despite being on hiatus, St\u2011Pierre holds the UFC record for most wins in title bouts. The UFC rating website, Fight Matrix, lists GSP as the number one fighter of all time.\nSt-Pierre said in an interview that he hoped to be like Wayne Gretzky, by acting as an ambassador for his sport and increasing its audience. In many ways, St-Pierre has carved out a path that echoes other Canadian sport celebrities. He\u2019s been a leader in his sport by promoting the adoption of stricter rules and sportsmanlike conduct in the octagon. He\u2019s also been vocal about the need for a stronger anti-doping policy in MMA and supported the adoption of regular drug testing by the UFC in 2015. Outside the octagon, the GSP Foundation distributes scholarship money to Quebec athletes and raises awareness about bullying. St-Pierre transcends his sport: he\u2019s a celebrity with endorsements and a social media following not entirely connected to MMA.\nIn other ways, St-Pierre has carved a path quite different from the male professional athletes who came before him. In 2013, he took a four-year career hiatus. Initially, the break was to recover from an injury. But since then, GSP has acknowledged that he needed a mental-health break to work on his sleeping problems and stress. By admitting his challenges and the anxiety sport causes him, GSP has broken with traditional models of masculinity. He promotes a holistic approach to wellness that goes beyond physical strength. Following his four-year break, St-Pierre returned to the octagon to win the Middleweight UFC Championship.\nThe Canadian Museum of History is the first institution in the world to acquire an item from the career of Georges St-Pierre and a UFC title belt. MMA is a contemporary phenomenon, dating to just 1993, and among the fastest growing sports in Canada.\nCanadian Museum of History, 2018.143.1\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/sleigh-used-to-carry-mail/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Sleigh used to carry mail", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-02-03 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 1997.7.1, IMG2013-0142-0030-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/harpoon-head/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Harpoon head", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-01-27 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, NhHd-1: 2658, IMG2008-0583-0110-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/horse-drawn-caboose/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Horse-drawn caboose", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-01-20 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 76-1, IMG2013-0142-0029-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/childs-snowshoes/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Child\u2019s snowshoes", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-01-13 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, III-B-601, IMG2008-0583-0033-Dm\nSnowshoes have been essential footwear in the Canadian winter for many centuries.

We spoke to curator Bianca Gendreau to discover how she and a core exhibition team managed to distill hundreds of artifacts, stories and legendary figures into one exceptional exhibition.\nMedieval Europe \u2013 Power and Splendour Zone 3: Royal Power, photo by Janet Kimber\nBehind every exhibition, there is an extensive and highly specialized team. For Medieval Europe \u2013 Power and Splendour, the core team consisted of a curator, designer, project manager and interpretive specialist. \u201cEveryone\u2019s voice was crucial,\u201d Gendreau says. \u201cA lot of thought and discussion went into each decision in the exhibition, and we respected each other\u2019s unique skill sets and particular expertise.\u201d\nTo present Medieval Europe, the Canadian Museum of History partnered with the world-renowned British Museum. Many of the artifacts came from the British Museum, but Medieval Europe is anything but a turnkey exhibition. From the beginning, the team worked hard to make the exhibition their own.\nThe British Museum supplied over 200 treasures, many of which had never been displayed in Canada. These were exquisite artifacts, but the exhibition team wanted a few more. Specifically, they wanted artifacts that were characteristic of the period. \u201cThere are some things that are synonymous with the Middle Ages that we just had to include,\u201d Gendreau explains. \u201cFor example, how can we talk about the period without tapestries, manuscripts or armour?\u201d They borrowed from other museums to supplement the already impressive collection from the British Museum.\nAs the exhibition team made their content choices, their North American audience was never far from their minds. Market surveys revealed that Canadians already know quite a bit about the Middle Ages, but they are hungry to learn more. The team added an interactive table at the heart of the exhibition to provide more detailed information about some well-known medieval characters \u2014 from real people, like King Louis IX, to mythic ones, like Robin Hood or King Arthur. \u201cThis was a way for us to provide more in-depth information about some familiar figures while tying them to the places and key events of the time,\u201d Gendreau explains.\nMedieval Europe \u2013 Power and Splendour Zone 4: People and Places of the Middle Ages, photo by Janet Kimber\nThe team also had their Canadian audience in mind when they added a final zone to the exhibition. Called Medieval Legacy, it explores the heritage of Europe\u2019s Middle Ages in North America today. \u201cThere were no Middle Ages in Canada,\u201d Gendreau says, \u201cbut many medieval values, influences and customs can still be seen in our country today. Look at our Parliament buildings. Or consider the values in our Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Often viewed as modern ideals, they actually took shape during the Middle Ages, beginning with the limits imposed on royal power by the Magna Carta of 1215.\u201d\nOnce the team was satisfied with the content of the exhibition, they focused on the presentation. \u201cDeveloping an exhibition is like creating a good story,\u201d Gendreau explains. As every good storyteller knows, the success of a story relies not just on what is being told, but also on how it is being told.\nThe team used design elements like layout, lighting, colour and music to immerse their audience in the story of medieval Europe. Most notably, they designed the entire exhibition to evoke a medieval castle and its environs. For example, content about royal power is displayed in a castle\u2019s great hall, while artifacts relating to courtly love are found in a garden setting. Visitors can also explore a castle chapel or a busy medieval street. The music changes with each zone. However, the team didn\u2019t set out to recreate a castle; rather, they worked hard to conjure the atmosphere of a castle. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling,\u201d Gendreau explains, \u201cnot a replica. We were careful not to go overboard. It\u2019s a contemporary look at medieval times.\u201d\nMedieval Europe \u2013 Power and Splendour Zone 5: Heavenly Treasures, photo by Janet Kimber\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/halifax-n-s-from-citadel/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Halifax N.S. from Citadel", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-12-09 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, William Notman, 2016-H0027.2.001\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/the-forster-doll-house/", "category": "Collection", "title": "The Forster doll house", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-12-09 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 88-9.1, IMG2009-0063-0077-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/victoria-memorial-museum-building/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Victoria Memorial Museum Building", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-12-02 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, unknown photographer, 71850 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/contempra-telephone/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Contempra Telephone", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-12-02 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 2006.41.5, IMG2009-0063-0109-Dp1\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/two-men-playing-checkers/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Two men playing checkers", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-11-25 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Arnprior Art Studio, IMG2008-0237-0013-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/prisoners-box/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Prisoner\u2019s box", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-11-25 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 986.281a, IMG2009-0063-0016-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/william-notman-witness-and-photographer-of-the-victorian-era/", "category": "Exhibitions", "title": "William Notman: Witness and Photographer of the Victorian era", "author": "John Willis", "timestamp": "2018-11-22 00:00:00", "text": "Why in 2018 should we be interested in William Notman? Perhaps because his success bears such powerful witness to interesting times in our history. Especially during the 1850s and 1860s, when Canada \u2014 a collage of disparate provinces and colonies \u2014 was only just coming into its own. In retracing his successful career, we learn something important about William Notman and about ourselves in a time when Britannia ruled the waves, and, in British North America, Montr\u00e9al ruled the roost.\nIn 1856, Scottish-born William Notman moved to Canada in search of a new life. He arrived first, with his wife and children following later. Montr\u00e9al would be Notman\u2019s destination and photography his profession. A gateway for hundreds of thousands of immigrants bound for North America, Montr\u00e9al was bursting with energy, labour and capital. Three ethnic cultures took root in the city: one Anglo-Protestant, a second Irish Catholic, the third French-Canadian and Catholic. They formed the triumvirate that characterized the social fabric of Montr\u00e9al in the Victorian era. The measure of Notman\u2019s success was his ability to navigate between these three worlds.\nRailways fanned out in all directions, putting the city in touch with Ontario, the Maritimes and New England. Ships called at the harbour, bringing immigrants and taking cargo to and from far away. The premier engineering achievement on the Canadian side of the Atlantic was the Victoria Bridge \u2014 a series of iron tubes resting on imposing piers \u2014 2.7\u00a0kilometres in length and completed by an army of some 3,000 workers in 1859. Notman obtained the contract for photographing the construction of the bridge. He innovated by creating large glass negatives, which allowed him to better show off the work in progress and because of the contract, his reputation grew considerably. This, together with the influx of migrants as Montr\u00e9al grew brought all sorts of people to his studio.\n\nWilliam McFarlane Notman, 100-ton mountain engine on the Canadian Pacific Railway, near Field, B.-C., 1889. VIEW-2508 \u00a9 McCord Museum\nPoliticians, priests, businessmen, and their wives and families strived to establish their social importance by having their picture taken. Notman was more than willing to oblige. He refined portrait-taking into an art form.The rich and famous visited his studio as did children, craftsmen, outdoorsmen, Indigenous chiefs and hunting guides. The latter were sometimes featured in what looked to be outdoor settings, but the photos were in fact all taken inside the studio.\nA man of innovation and business, Notman relentlessly popularized the images he took by arranging for them to appear in books, postcards and cartes de visite. Lithographed versions of his shots appeared on the front page of a new kind of publication: the illustrated news gazette. With strong ties to the artistic community -some \u00a0artists worked on his extravagant compositions \u2014 Notman aimed to establish photography as an art, not a documentary science or mere technique. He helped pave the way for the rise of visual content in the media. From then on, curious eyes would scan for visual reinforcement of whatever written words might appear on the page. This is a habit we take for granted today.\nNotman\u2019s photos of Montr\u00e9al and other towns and cities \u2014 and of the lakes, hills and rivers of the eastern countryside, and the breathtaking landscape of western Canada\u00a0\u2014 would help shape the geographic imagination of the new Canadian dominion. Notman\u2019s collection provides us with an opportunity to look back on our history, to a point in time when Canada was modernizing. The black and white world of William Notman, offers a perspective from which to glimpse our current path, with its digital technologies and never-ending passion for the visual imagery and exchange. Today, we text and share thoughts and pictures constantly. To some extent we were taught to do this by the likes of William Notman.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/parliament-building/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Parliament Building", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-11-18 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, unknown photographer, 38.29 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/flute/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Flute", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-11-18 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, V-X-476, IMG2008-0583-0169-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/armistice-day/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Armistice Day", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-11-11 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Edwin Lester Brittain, PR2004-006.8.3-790\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/mallet/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Mallet", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-11-11 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 2007.86.3, IMG2009-0459-0378-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/icebreaker-ccgs-diberville/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Icebreaker CCGS D\u2019Iberville", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-11-04 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Betty Marwood, IMG2015-0377-1239-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/decoy-3/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Decoy", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-11-04 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, CCECT 78-1712, S95-12154\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/horse-drawn-hearse-2/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Horse-drawn hearse", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-10-28 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, unknown photographer, IMG2010-0015-0002-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/18th-century-clock/", "category": "Collection", "title": "18th century clock", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-10-28 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 980.44.1a-f, S89-1726\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/a-mysterious-stamp/", "category": "Spotlight on the National Collection", "title": "A mysterious stamp", "author": "Jennifer Millar", "timestamp": "2018-10-24 00:00:00", "text": "A few years ago, the Canadian Museum of History acquired a stamp design, called an essay, that is both a national treasure\u2026 and a mystery.\n\u201cWhen it became available, I was excited because I knew it would be a valuable addition to the Canadian Stamp Collection,\u201d says Bianca Gendreau, the Museum\u2019s Manager, Contemporary Canada and the World. \u201cNow all Canadians can experience an essay that may be associated with Louis Riel\u2019s provisional government of Manitoba. It is one of the greatest mysteries of Canadian philately.\u201d\nTen copies of this essay are known to exist, the first of which surfaced in 1929, sparking intense collector interest. Three of the ten are in Britain\u2019s Royal Philatelic Collection. And, since the discovery of the essays, there has been an ongoing debate about their date of origin and production history.\nPhilatelic essay that could have been commissioned by Louis Riel. Canadian Museum of History, IMG2015-0100-0039-Dm\n\u201cAfter the essays were discovered, researchers began to investigate their attribution to Riel, an emblematic figure of Canadian history,\u201d says Gendreau.\nWhen Riel formed a provisional government during the Red River Rebellion of 1869\u20131870, he appointed a postmaster, prominent businessman Andrew Graham Ballenden Bannatyne. Some believe that this appointment reflected both Riel\u2019s confidence and his belief in the symbolic value of a postal system to a new nation. The production of a postage stamp would have been the next natural step.\nAnother theory holds that the essays were created during the ill-fated North-West Rebellion of 1885, which led to Riel\u2019s conviction for treason. Although the woman on the essay doesn\u2019t resemble Marianne, the allegory of Republican France, she\u2019s wearing a type of cap that symbolizes liberty and the French Revolution.\nAn alternative to the Riel hypothesis holds that the essays were made by O. Kendall, a Winnipeg stamp merchant, or by Samuel Allan Taylor, also a stamp merchant.

Canadian Museum of History\nJohnson became leader of the Union nationale in 1961, and to many represented \u201cthe old guard.\u201d Commentators viewed him as populist and old-fashioned, and political cartoonists depicted him as an unscrupulous cowboy, calling him \u201cDanny Boy\u201d \u2014 an allusion to his Irish origins. Johnson, however, had used his years in opposition to renew the platform and organization of the Union nationale, and to recruit promising new faces. To everyone\u2019s surprise, thanks to solid support in rural areas and a splitting of the vote between a number of small independent parties, he defeated Jean Lesage\u2019s Liberals in the 1966 Quebec election.\nIt was then that the once-cautious political leader showed his true colours: those of a premier with a sense of statehood, who wanted not only to maintain but accelerate Quebec\u2019s growing self-affirmation and sense of identity. Within the broader realm of relations with the federal government in Ottawa, he issued an ultimatum that was both resounding and ambiguous: \u201cEquality or Independence.\u201d Johnson flirted with the Quebec autonomy and independence movements, without committing himself irrevocably to either cause.\n\u00c9galit\u00e9 ou ind\u00e9pendance, published in 1965.

It was also under Johnson\u2019s leadership that CEGEPs \u2014 an educational cornerstone bridging high school and university \u2014 were born. His government was also responsible for founding the Ministry of International Relations, which expanded Quebec\u2019s place on the world stage; and Radio-Qu\u00e9bec, which would later become T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec.\nThe loss of Daniel Johnson marks 1968, in both Quebec and the rest of Canada, as a year of reconfigured political roles and realities. French Canada\u2019s most influential intellectual, Andr\u00e9 Laurendeau, passed away in June of that year. The former editor-in-chief of the daily newspaper Le Devoir, and Joint Chair of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, was among those who, like Johnson, sought to resolve the \u201cQuebec Question.\u201d\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/13725/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Boats on the Great Slave Lake", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-09-23 00:00:00", "text": "Boats on the Great Slave Lake\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/glenn-gould-scarf/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Glenn Gould scarf", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-09-23 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 96-161, D2002-014818\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/bella-coola-village/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Bella Coola village", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-09-19 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Harlan ingersoll Smith, 50275 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/13711/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Covered bridge", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-09-18 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Marius Barbeau, 2004-522\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/pocket-watch-2/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Pocket watch", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-09-16 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 981.15.1.1-3, IMG2012-0362-0007-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/comb/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Comb", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-09-09 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, NjRc-1:592, IMG2011-0323-0011-Dm\nCombs, many with elaborate decoration, are frequently found in archaeological sites once occupied by Thule Inuit (ancestors of the modern Inuit).

Though written on a single piece of paper, the document speaks volumes about the fate of Sir John Franklin and his crew.\nThe note is actually a standard preprinted Admiralty form with two handwritten messages. The first, written in May 1847, confirmed that Franklin was in command of the Expedition and that all was well. The second message, added in April 1848, tells a much different story. Twenty-four people, including Franklin, were dead. Even more alarmingly, the Expedition ships, HMS Erebus and Terror, had been deserted after being trapped by sea ice for 19 months.\nThe exhibition\u2019s curator, Dr. Karen Ryan, explains that the Victory Point Note was found in 1859, just south of Victory Point on the northwest coast of King William Island, where Franklin\u2019s surviving crew members came ashore after leaving their ships. It remains the only known record detailing the crew\u2019s plan to walk to the Back River in a last attempt to survive. It is a crucial piece of evidence, and Ryan knew it would be an exciting addition to Death in the Ice.\nVictory Point Note. \u00a9 National Maritime Museum, London.\nHowever, the note had never been displayed outside England before. Ryan admits she did not have high hopes of being allowed to display it in Death in the Ice. \u201cBut one thing I\u2019ve learned,\u201d she said, \u201cis that it never hurts to ask.\u201d Figuring the worst case scenario would be a \u201cno,\u201d she asked the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, if it would allow the document to be included in the exhibition. To her delight (and surprise), the National Maritime Museum agreed \u2014 on the condition that the note would be very well protected.\n\u201cIt was a big decision to let this significant piece of evidence travel and be put on display at the Canadian Museum of History,\u201d said Amanda Gould, paper conservator at the Museum. Although the note was taken out of the Arctic in 1859, 11 years after it was left on King William Island by Franklin\u2019s surviving crew, it likely suffered a lot in that time, getting wet and going through a number of freeze-thaw cycles. Since it was kept in a metal canister while there, it has rust stains, which can be very detrimental to the cellulose of the paper. \u201cUnderstandably, the lender was concerned about the welfare of this very fragile document,\u201d Gould said.\nSo how, exactly, do you safely display a 170-year-old piece of paper? \u201cIt was a pretty big challenge,\u201d admitted Gould. The lender asked that the note be put into a case similar to the one Library and Archives Canada and the Canadian Conservation Institute produced for the display of two copies of the Proclamation of the Constitution Act. The multi-functional case was designed to protect documents with light-sensitive ink, both in storage and in travel. \u201cGreenwich asked if our Museum could produce a case of that sort for the note\u2019s travel and display, so that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\nGould makes it sound simple, but the process was extensive, involving a lot of back and forth between the museums. Following the lengthy process of gathering requirements, the Museum of History hired Zone Display Cases to finalize the design and fabricate the case.\nOf the case\u2019s many details, including its airtightness, the one that visitors will notice first is the SmartGlassTM. Designed to minimize the note\u2019s exposure to light, this glass is opaque when no one is looking at the document. When a visitor pushes a button, an electrical voltage is applied, causing the glass to shift from dark to clear so he or she can see through it. As Gould explains, it is the high-tech version of protecting a painting behind a curtain until you want to look at it, at which point you pull the curtain aside.\nThe Museum always takes great care with its artifacts, but with a borrowed, weathered 170-year-old piece of paper \u2014 one that also happens to be a key clue in the Franklin mystery \u2014 it took even more precautions than usual. \u201cWe really upped the ante in terms of the methods and materials we used to display it,\u201d said Gould.\nThis single piece of paper is a key piece of evidence in unravelling the Franklin mystery. Today, thanks to the efforts of Museum staff \u2014 and the trust that the National Maritime Museum placed in them \u2014 it plays a crucial role in the Museum\u2019s groundbreaking presentation of that story.\nThe exhibition Death in the Ice \u2013 The Mystery of the Franklin Expedition\u00a0is presented until September 30, 2018 at the Canadian Museum of History.\n[Transcript of the Victory Point Note]\n28 of May 1847\nH.M.S.hips Erebus and Terror Wintered in the Ice in Lat. 70\u00b05\u2019N Long. 98\u00b023\u2019W Having wintered in 1846-7 [sic] at Beechey Island in Lat 74\u00b043\u201928\u2019\u2019N Long 91\u00b039\u201915\u2019\u2019W\nAfter having ascended Wellington Channel to Lat 77\u00b0 and returned by the West side of Cornwallis Island.\nSir John Franklin commanding the Expedition.\nAll well\nParty consisting of 2 Officers and 6 Men left the ships on Monday 24th May 1847.\n[signed] Gm.

Whether they are personal experiences, historical accounts or oral histories, the stories will form the basis of Indigenous Stories Beyond Borders (working title), an exhibition that is currently under development and scheduled to open in 2021.\nBy turning the spotlight on individuals and groups that have travelled the world as diplomats, warriors/soldiers, performers, artists, athletes and/or scholars, the exhibition will highlight stories about how Indigenous peoples have asserted, and continue to assert, their sovereignty and identities beyond Canada\u2019s borders.\nWe could tell these stories ourselves, but that is not our goal. We believe the success of this exhibition lays in reaching out and collaborating with those who know the stories best.\nWhat we are looking for\nWithout neglecting them, we want to go beyond the tragic stories of the people who were held captive as \u201cNew World curiosities\u201d to be exhibited to Europeans. \u00a0A goal of the exhibition is to emphasize the initiative, leadership, creativity and agency of First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis people.\nOne theme will highlight the many individuals that went overseas in an effort to assert their rights. Among them were the leaders erroneously known as the \u201cFour Indian Kings\u201d who met Queen Anne in 1710 and, 115 years later, the Wendat chiefs who appeared before King George\u00a0IV in 1825. The portraits of these eight leaders have helped immortalize those events. \u00a0Let us also remember the thousands of Indigenous soldiers who served in both World Wars, and Levi General Deskaheh, the Cayuga diplomat who went to the headquarters of the League of Nations, in Geneva, in 1923.\nThese are just a few examples. We are certain that there are many more fascinating stories out there. Has a contemporary female artist created a work in a public space in Asia that shocked people when they saw it? Has an Indigenous athlete received international recognition? Have Indigenous people from Canada collaborated with First Peoples in Africa or New Zealand, or are they doing so today? It\u2019s up to you to share these stories.\nLike all museum exhibitions, this one will also include objects that illustrate the stories being told, to showcase the material culture surrounding the events highlighted or resulting from them.\nHow to participate\nTo facilitate the gathering of information, we have created a website: historymuseum.ca/indigenous-stories. We think it will be easier and faster for people to submit their stories using this online tool, from anywhere.\nOf course, no matter how relevant or touching the story, not all can be included in the exhibition. With the help of an external advisory committee, the Museum\u2019s curatorial team will carefully select stories that will make up the exhibition\u2019s narrative. To develop the content, the curators will work closely with the individuals and communities that have shown an interest in the project and have a direct link to the stories.\nWhether they are personal accounts or oral histories of ancestors (famous or not) who travelled the globe, the curatorial team would be delighted to receive your stories and consider how they could be included in the exhibition. We eagerly look forward to hearing from you.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/totem-poles/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Totem poles", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-07-08 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Marius Barbeau, 62333\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/inuit-carving-of-a-european-ship/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Inuit carving of a European ship", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-07-08 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, IX-C:1100, IMG2016-0321-0023-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/log-drivers-boots/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Log driver\u2019s boots", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-07-02 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 978.114.46 a-b, IMG2009-0063-0015-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/the-snowbirds/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "The snowbirds", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-07-01 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Pierre Carrier, S89-2764\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/coat/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Coat", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-06-25 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, D-17939, IMG2014-0156-0021-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/fort-chambly/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Fort Chambly", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-06-24 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Frank Oliver Call, PR2002-44\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/an-elegant-mustard-pot-from-a-seigneurial-manor/", "category": "Spotlight on the National Collection", "title": "An elegant mustard pot from a seigneurial manor", "author": "Isabelle Charron", "timestamp": "2018-06-22 00:00:00", "text": "The Canadian Museum of History recently acquired a small silver dish associated with the history of the seigneurial system in Canada. It is a neo-Georgian mustard pot, and the engraved monogram it bears \u2014 \u201cS.O.\u201d \u2014 indicates that it once belonged to the Saint-Ours, a seigneurial family.\nMade in London, England, in 1797, the pot was reworked by Paul Morin, a silversmith in Qu\u00e9bec City. It was thus \u201cCanadianized\u201d by being modified and used in the very specific context of the seigneurial system. In Lower Canada, in the early 19th century, mustard was consumed by people of all walks of life, but few had the privilege of owning silverware.\nThe first seigneur in the Saint-Ours family was Pierre de Saint-Ours, a nobleman and captain in the Carignan-Sali\u00e8res Regiment who arrived in Canada in 1665. Shortly thereafter, he moved onto the seigneury granted to him by Intendant Jean Talon, located in the Richelieu River area. At the time, seigneurs were required to help settle their seigneuries, under the auspices of the King of France. The Saint-Ours stayed in the colony after the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1763. They quickly formed an alliance with the new British colonial elite, as did several other seigneurial families, and carried on the family\u2019s military tradition.\nThis mustard pot was manufactured in London, England, by Alexander Field in 1797 and reworked in Qu\u00e9bec City by silversmith Paul Morin between 1800 and 1815. Canadian Museum of History, 2017.62.2\nSeigneur Charles de Saint-Ours (1753\u20131834), who was also an officer and politician, had a new manor house built starting in 1792. Around that time, he married Josephte Murray, great-niece of General James Murray, the first British governor of Qu\u00e9bec City. The Saint-Ours often received members of the elite at their manor. The silver mustard pot, most likely acquired in the days of Charles de Saint-Ours, gives an indication of the prestigious surroundings in which the condiment was consumed: at a seigneurial manor, by a family who had several servants and occasionally received distinguished guests. Silverware was a symbol of social status and reflected a desire to distinguish oneself from other people, especially the censitaires, the tenant farmers who occupied the seigneury\u2019s lands but did not own them.\nFor over 45 years, Charles de Saint-Ours devoted himself to the development of his seigneury. In 1815, Joseph Bouchette stated the following about the Saint-Ours seigneury: \u201cUnder the various considerations of extent, situation, local advantages, the quantity of lands in cultivation, the state of husbandry, and the population, which amounts to 3,000 souls, there are certainly but few possessions in the province superior in value to this one.\u201d Because the development of the seigneuries varied greatly over time and from one region to another, the Saint-Ours seigneury is not necessarily a typical example. The seigneurial family bequeathed its name and its coat of arms to the present-day city of Saint-Ours, Quebec.\nWhen Canada became a British colony, there were about 250 seigneuries in the Saint\u00a0Lawrence Valley, and the seigneurial system endured there long after the Conquest. At the time, it was on the decline in England, and it would be abolished in France by the Revolution. Some of the settlers who arrived from Britain also became seigneurs, including Scottish officers Malcolm Fraser and John Nairne in Murray Bay La Malbaie.\nIn Quebec, the abolition of the seigneurial system did not begin until 1854, when the Act\u00a0for the Abolition of Feudal Rights and Duties in Lower Canada was passed. However, some former censitaires continued to pay rent until 1940, and others paid a municipal tax until 1970 to compensate former seigneurs. In certain localities, the members of some seigneurial families were called seigneurs and seigneuresses until very recently.\nThe Museum\u2019s collection includes many items that reflect the way of life of this elite of days gone by.

Those in first class included Sir Henry Seton-Karr, a British sports enthusiast and member of Parliament who was heading home after a moose-hunting holiday in Canada. Second class included upward of 170 members of the Salvation Army, en route to a world congress in London. Many of the third-class passengers were recent immigrants to Canada and the United States.

Many were trapped in their cabins and drowned below deck.\nPortrait of Florence Barbour. Canadian Museum of History, IMG2012-0381-0004-Dm\nThe story of Florence Lorraine Barbour\nStill, the greatest loss in this tragedy was the children. Of the 138 aboard, only five escaped death. Most of the youngsters (102) were in third class. One of the survivors, eight years old and travelling in second class with her mother and sister, was Florence Lorraine Barbour. Florence\u2019s mother (Sabena) and father (Thomas) were from Cumberland, England. They came to the mining district of the Kootenays in British Columbia shortly after their marriage in 1896. Thomas Barbour worked in and around the mines as a teamster. Unfortunately, he was killed in a work accident in May 1913.\nAfter her husband passed away Sabena moved with her two girls from New Denver to Silverton, B.C. The following year, she decided that a visit home to her family in England was in order. They were a party of five: Sabena, her two girls and two family friends, Robert Crellin and William Barrie.\nThe Empress departed on May 28, 1914. That night, just hours later, Florence was saved by Robert Crellin when he burst into her room, took her on his back, made his way up on deck and dived into the water before the ship sank. Subsequently, Florence was taken to England to be brought up by her father\u2019s family, leaving Robert out of the family loop. He was prepared to bring Florence up himself, but it was not to be.\nThe Canadian Museum of History has in its collection Florence\u2019s memoir of these tragic events. In it, she expresses her desire to live out her life in British Columbia, where she was born. She wanted to be buried \u201cin the lovely little cemetery underneath the mountains\u201d at Silverton, along with her father and her uncle* Robert. She ends her memoir by dedicating it to the man who saved her life: \u201cRobert Crellin who saved a little girl 8 years of age of the Empress of Ireland on 29 May 1914.\u201d\nFlorence writes poignantly of her visit to Canada in 1964, 50 years after the collision of the two ships. She met old friends and Robert Crellin\u2019s son, who gave her his father\u2019s watch \u2014 the one he had on him the night of the tragedy. After her visit, Florence returned home to England where she passed away in the fall of 1972. She was a lucky survivor of Canada\u2019s worst maritime disaster, but Florence would die far away from her birthplace in the Canadian mountains and her dearest uncle and father.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/s-s-empress-of-scotland/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "S.S.

The new Canadian History Hall offers important insights into the complex story of Canada\u2019s growing ethnic diversity in the 20th century.\nOne of the important threads in the Hall\u2019s third gallery \u2014 Modern Canada \u2014 is how political and social struggle, along with changing social norms, helped to broaden rights and social inclusion over the last century. The challenge of negotiating differences remains a constant in Canada today. And the experiences and voices of Asian Canadians offer powerful perspectives on this theme.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Canada was not, in many ways, an inclusive or tolerant society. This was reflected in our country\u2019s immigration policy and in social attitudes toward ethnic and other minorities in the early 1900s. The story of the Komagata Maru \u2014 a ship carrying predominantly Sikh migrants that unsuccessfully challenged existing immigration policies restricting migration from Asia in 1914 \u2014 is an example of how the exhibition explores attitudes about race and religion.\nChinese Students Football Club, British Columbia Mainland Champions 1932 and 1933, C.B.

Sitting, left to right: Lem On, Dock Yip, Art Yip, Quene Yip, Frank Wong, Buck S. Chung\nFurther, government policy toward Chinese immigration to Canada reflected racial attitudes of the time. The Chinese head tax, instituted after the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, was systematically increased in the early 1900s. In 1923, the federal government went beyond the fee-based admission policy of the head tax and passed the Chinese Immigration Act, also known as the Chinese Exclusion Act. It effectively cut off any further migration from China. The act remained in effect until 1947.\nChinese Canadians maintained community solidarity and fought for their rights through a variety of community associations throughout the interwar period. The Chinese Students Soccer team \u2014 based in Vancouver, British Columbia \u2014 was a tangible reminder of the Chinese community\u2019s resilience in this difficult period. Founded in 1920 and winners of the prestigious Mainland Cup in 1933, the team transcended prejudices and racial boundaries of the time: Chinese and white people were at least equals on the field.\nThe legacy of such policies is also an important element within the exhibition. A ceremonial spike given by Chinese-Canadian leaders to Prime Minister Stephen Harper during the 2006 federal government apology for the head tax is a powerful symbol of the Chinese-Canadian community\u2019s historical presence in and contributions to Canadian society.\nThe ceremonial spike given by Chinese-Canadian leaders to Prime Minister Stephen Harper on display in the Canadian History Hall. Canadian Museum of History\nDuring the Second World War, a mix of racism and fears about domestic security led the Canadian government to use the War Measures Act to intern, relocate and revoke the voting privileges of thousands of Japanese Canadians. After the war, changing social attitudes and community-led efforts for equality led to a new, more inclusive citizenship and voting rights. Restrictive legislation on Chinese immigration, Japanese-Canadian relocation regulations and other discriminatory measures were lifted.\nThroughout the postwar era, Canadians worked to broaden social and legal recognition of rights and identities, creating an increasingly open, accepting and diverse Canada. When Baltej Singh Dhillon applied to the RCMP in 1988, he was told he could not wear his turban \u2014 a fundamental part of his Sikh religion \u2014 with his uniform. He challenged the policy. A heated public debate ensued as many resisted changes to the RCMP uniform. In 1990, the federal government intervened and the RCMP changed its policy to accommodate the Sikh turban. The conflict and ultimate success of Baltej Singh Dhillon\u2019s fight is represented in the third gallery by one of Singh\u2019s RCMP uniforms, with his official-issue turban, along with examples of pins issued by organizations opposed to the change.\nOne of Baltej Singh Dhillon RCMP uniforms on display in the Canadian History Hall.

Large and heavy, with a beaver and the intertwined letters \u201cHB\u201d embossed on one side,\u00a0the pendant\u00a0was a conspicuous symbol of status within fur-trade society.\nThe pendant is particularly important for two reasons. First, most trade jewellery given to Indigenous people was made of silver, not gold plate. Second, it is a rare example of gold work from well-known Montr\u00e9al silversmith Charles Arnoldi (1779\u20131817).\nThis rare example of a Hudson\u2019s Bay gold-plated lead pendant is 10 cm x 7.5 cm and was made in the early 1800s by Montr\u00e9al silversmith Charles Arnoldi. Canadian Museum of History, 2014.72.1, IMG2015-0189-0003-Dm\nThe pendant would have been perceived by many as a sign of equality between traders and Indigenous people in the Western regions. \u201cIndigenous people tended not to trade unless they had some kind of bond with the traders,\u201d says Timothy P. Foran, Curator of British North America at the Museum. \u201cFor the most part, they engaged in trade on their own terms and European newcomers had to respect Indigenous customs. At the same time, the fur trade was the beginning of a permanent European presence in the Indigenous homelands of the West. It set the stage for the takeover of Indigenous territory by the Canadian state in the 1870s.\u201d\nChallenging the monopoly: The birth of the North West Company\nStruck between 1800 and 1815, the pendant was the direct consequence of an increasingly fierce trading rivalry between HBC and the North West Company, founded in Montr\u00e9al in April 1779. \u201cThe Hudson\u2019s Bay Company started in the 1670s by building a few posts on the shores of Hudson Bay and simply waiting for Indigenous people to come to them,\u201d explains Foran. \u201cIn contrast, the North West Company built a series of forts in the interior and created an expansive transportation and trade network, stretching from the valley of the St. Lawrence to the Rocky Mountains and beyond. Because the North West Company used silver jewellery as trade items, HBC had to as well, although they had never made much use of such items before then. The North West Company forced HBC to become innovative and competitive.\u201d\nToo competitive, as it turned out. As HBC expanded its network and increased its investment in trade goods, and as stocks of fur-bearing animals declined or disappeared altogether in some regions, the two companies behaved as if they were at war \u2014 indeed, there was bloodshed on both sides. By 1821, the British government had had enough and forced the two companies to merge into a new, leaner Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. Thereafter, HBC began removing silver and gold pieces from its trade as these items were extremely expensive to produce.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/remnant-of-the-the-cold-war/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Remnant of the the Cold War", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-04-15 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, unknown photographer, 81-4043\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/tiffany-inkwell/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Tiffany inkwell", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-04-15 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 1994.141.1 a-b, IMG2011-0005-0031-Dm.jpg\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/sugarhouse/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Sugarhouse", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-04-08 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Frank Oliver Call, PR2002-12\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/jointer-plane/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Jointer plane", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-04-08 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 988.77.6 a-c, IMG2009-0063-0042\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/the-portrait-darcy-mcgee-never-lived-to-see/", "category": "Canadian History Hall", "title": "The portrait D\u2019Arcy McGee never lived to see", "author": "Sylvain Raymond", "timestamp": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "text": "One hundred and fifty years ago, a group of Thomas D\u2019Arcy McGee\u2019s friends were planning a special gift: a portrait in honour of the politician\u2019s 43rd birthday.

Canadian Museum of History, IMG2017-0043-0019-Dm\nEuphrasia Quinn, McGee\u2019s eldest daughter, took the portrait with her when she left Montr\u00e9al for California. Eventually, the painting was passed down to D\u2019Arcy Quinn, McGee\u2019s great-great grandson. Mr. Quinn had it hanging in his house in Switzerland until a chance meeting in Ireland with Canadian Museum of History CEO Mark O\u2019Neill led to its current temporary home in the Museum.\nTo many, Thomas D\u2019Arcy McGee seemed an unlikely Father of Confederation. During his youth in Ireland, McGee was involved in efforts to free his native country from British rule. Having once described himself as \u201ca traitor to the British government,\u201d he advocated revolution in favour of the Irish nationalist cause. However, after immigrating to the United Canadas, McGee developed a profound respect for British-style parliamentary government, seeing it as a way for minorities to enjoy liberty and tolerance. Always a compelling orator, he was elected to assembly in 1857 and became famous for his impassioned writings and speeches in favour of Confederation.\nMcGee\u2019s political change of heart and his denunciation of the Irish national movement, Fenianism, took a toll on his popularity. Many Irish immigrants, the community he sought to defend, began to see him as a traitor.\nOn Tuesday, April 7, 1868, he was shot and killed on Sparks Street outside his Ottawa home. Suspecting a Fenian conspiracy, the authorities quickly arrested Patrick James Whelan, who was found with a recently fired revolver in his possession. The revolver was later used to convict Whelan, but doubts about his guilt have long persisted. He maintained his innocence right up to the gallows, claiming to \u201cknow the man who shot Mr. McGee,\u201d but never providing a name.\nMcGee\u2019s funeral attracted tens of thousands of people to the streets of Montr\u00e9al, where he was buried on what would have been his 43rd birthday.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/bison-vertebra-with-arrowhead/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Bison vertebra with arrowhead", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, X-B:17, S91-2020\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/a-cod-fish-of-90-lbs/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "A Cod fish of 90 lbs", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Marcel Rioux, J3198\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/nunavut/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Nunavut", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-04-01 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, UN CD 1993-001, IMG2009-0063-0040-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/first-snowmobile-going-up-to-scientific-camp-of-admiral-macmillan/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "First snowmobile going up to Scientific camp of Admiral MacMillan", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-03-25 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, unknown photographer, 75-12501-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/st-onuphrius-church/", "category": "Collection", "title": "St. Onuphrius church", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-03-25 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 995.6.188, IMG2017-0107-0001-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/man-making-maple-sugar/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Man making maple sugar", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-03-18 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Marius Barbeau, 102425\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/randy-bachman-guitar/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Randy Bachman guitar", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-03-18 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 95-26 a-b, IMG2016-0106-0006-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/bringing-franklins-ships-to-life/", "category": "Exhibitions", "title": "Bringing Franklin\u2019s ships to life", "author": "Kerry McMaster Wassenaar", "timestamp": "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "text": "Death in the Ice \u2014 The Mystery of the Franklin Expedition tells the story of Sir John Franklin\u2019s tragic final voyage, which set sail from England in 1845. Museum scenographer Kerry McMaster Wassenaar led the team responsible for designing the exhibition space, a crucial part of the storytelling process. In this post, she describes how the team depicted life aboard the Expedition\u2019s two vessels, where Franklin and his men spent many long, ice-bound months. She also recounts the challenges involved presenting an Expedition ship within the exhibition space.\nIt started with some tape on the floor in an office, where exhibition curator Karen Ryan had laid out some of the cramped spaces on HMS Erebus and Terror. She was looking for a way to show visitors just how small the spaces were for the 60-plus men who lived aboard each ship for three years.\nWe were planning the \u201cLife on Board the Ships\u201d zone of the exhibition, but knew we couldn\u2019t make an exact copy of the ship\u2019s interior, given that it wouldn\u2019t accommodate wheelchair access or our budget. We needed to abstract the environment while still communicating its details. We needed a place to \u201chang\u201d our human story and our messages about exactly what the sailors did all day when their ships were stuck in the ice for an extended period.\nWe did have fabulous digital versions of the original floor plans for both ships, along with several illustrations of their interiors. For some of us, that would be enough. One of my favourite books in middle school was a book of Victorian house plans. I would pore over the layouts and imagine myself in the houses. But how could we get the average visitor\u00a0\u2014\u00a0someone less geeky than I about old plans\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to make the leap from paper space into an imagined 3D world? Creating an immersive 3D floor plan at full scale became the solution. We could then pick and choose which elements and walls would be represented only on the floor plan, and which elements would occupy 3D space.\nThankfully, there are people out there who enjoy poring over old floor plans even more than I do. The creator of a scale model of HMS Terror had drawn vertical elevations of many of the interior spaces of the ships. This allowed us to fill in the missing vertical walls, and saved our team weeks of research.\nThe Museum gallery is too small to accommodate a plan of the whole ship \u2014 especially since we needed to save space for the rest of the exhibition \u2014 but in an exhibition story driven by setting, I wanted visitors to have the sense of a whole ship.\nWe needed a upper-deck bow where visitors could gaze out and understand that, while the men lived in a cramped, dark space, outside that cramped space was a vast, icy, desolate and sometimes very bright seascape. It was, ironically, the very vastness of that seascape that was ultimately responsible for their claustrophobic living conditions.\nPreliminary design phase of ship plans (top) and paper model (bottom). \u00a9 Canadian Museum of History\nAmazingly, the diameter of the columns in the gallery is very similar to the diameter of the masts of HMS Erebus and Terror, so I positioned the bow at the correct distance from the first \u201cmast\u201d and the rest of the show\u2019s layout followed from there.\nWe then needed to figure out how much of the floor plan we would show, and how we would transition from inside on the lower deck to outside on the upper deck. Karen Ryan, creative development specialist Claire Champ and I spent a lot of time putting notes on the original floor plans, seeing which spaces we needed to display while matching our messages to different parts of the ship. Usually text and content dictate graphic design. In this case, the design influenced which content could be presented, and where.\nOver time, it all came together. We added quotations, artifacts, audiovisual elements \u2014 and even a monkey \u2014 to fill in the story. We made the floor plan bilingual and introduced legible fonts, while still retaining a historical feel as a nod to the original plans.\nIn the exhibition, view of the ship\u2019s space with bow on the left and stern on the right. \u00a9 Canadian Museum of History\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/on-board-of-the-cgs-arctic/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "On board of the CGS Arctic", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-03-11 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Joseph Dewey Soper, 60900\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/hooked-rug/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Hooked rug", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-03-11 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 80.588, IMG2013-0142-0025-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/haida-dugout-canoe/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Haida dugout canoe", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-03-04 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Clyde Patch, I.5d.26 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/northwest-coast-adze/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Northwest coast adze", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-03-04 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, VII-F-377, IMG2008-0583-0233-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/nunatsiarmut-igloo/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Nunatsiarmut igloo", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-02-25 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, unknown photographer, 2078 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/maskekowak-knife-and-sheath/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Mask\u0113kowak knife and sheath", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-02-25 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, III-D-568 a, b, S89-1834\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/year-of-the-dog/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Year of the dog!", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-02-18 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, 2000-1554, 50792, 74-18631, S2004-867 LS, 69094, 83-6335, 51136, 39528, 43976\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/uniform-of-the-ottawa-snowshoe-club/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Uniform of the Ottawa Snowshoe Club", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-02-18 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 2000.194, IMG2013-0142-0039-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/inuit-drawings-capture-a-changing-world/", "category": "Exhibitions", "title": "Inuit drawings capture a changing world", "author": "Linda Grussani", "timestamp": "2018-02-16 00:00:00", "text": "Picturing Arctic Modernity \u2013 North Baffin Drawings From 1964, a new exhibition at the Canadian Museum of History, offers vivid insight into Inuit identity and culture, through an eloquent series of drawings that examine daily life during a period of tremendous social change.\nPicturing Arctic Modernity features 50 graphite-on-paper drawings from the Museum\u2019s Terrence Peter Ryan Baffin Island Drawing Collection. The collection is comprised of 1,842\u00a0works created during the first three months of 1964 by 159 Inuit living in the North Qikqtaaluk (Baffin Island) communities of Kanngiqtugaapik (Clyde River), Mittimatalik (Pond Inlet), Ikpiarjuk (Arctic Bay), Igloolik, and nearby outlying encampments.\nThe drawing project was initiated by Terry Ryan, then the resident arts advisor at the Kinngait (Cape Dorset) art studio near the southern end of Qikqtaaluk. Ryan provided drawing materials and encouraged the Inuit men, women and youth to record their experiences on paper. The result is an outstanding documentary and artistic record, encompassing a wealth of Inuit traditional knowledge.\nWe Are Using Another Way of Life Today,\u00a0Martha Coronik Akoomalik\u00a0\u00a0\u00a9 Canadian Museum of History, IV-C-8204\nThe drawings offer a reflection on Inuit life in the 1960s \u2014 a period of profound change for Inuit in the eastern Arctic, as they were moved off the land and into permanent settlements. In their work, the artists address a wide range of subjects, while presenting individual perspectives on Inuit life. Many of the drawings are overlaid with Inuktitut writing, ranging from straightforward descriptions of the content to highly detailed passages. The Museum acquired this unique collection from Terry Ryan in 2014.\nPicturing Arctic Modernity offers multiple perspectives and narratives related to Inuit culture and identity. The selected drawings are organized into three themes: Conveying Identities, On the Land, and Our Stories. The exhibition offers visitors several levels of interpretation to engage with these visually rich drawings \u2014 including an in-gallery guide with translations of the Inuktitut writing, and video clips of the artists and community members sharing the importance of these works today. The design is inspired by a northern aesthetic. The intro wall, for example, is illuminated with points of light \u2014 recalling a northern community seen from afar, beckoning one to enter the space. The gallery walls have been painted to evoke various shades of snow.\nThe entire exhibition is presented in Inuktitut, French and English.\nThis travelling exhibition was developed by the Agnes Etherington Art Centre and the Canadian Museum of History, with the assistance of the Pond Inlet Archives, Ilisaqsivik, Ittaq and Piqqusilirivvik, and funded in part by the Museums Assistance Program of the Government of Canada. It was curated by Dr. Norman Vorano, Queen\u2019s National Scholar, Curator of Indigenous Art at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre, and former Curator of Contemporary Inuit Art at the Canadian Museum of History. It involved the contributions of many interpreters, translators, film crews and editors from the north, as well as a large team of production services, researchers and museum professionals in the south.

That year, Canadian skaters took home two gold medals. The RCAF Flyers won the men\u2019s hockey gold, despite concerns leading into the Games that the team might not be internationally competitive.\nCanada\u2019s other gold medal went to 19-year-old figure skater Barbara Ann Scott. The ice conditions weren\u2019t good for her event: hockey and figure skating shared the outdoor rink in St. Moritz, so Scott had to compete on ice rutted from the hockey games and watery from unseasonably warm temperatures. Nonetheless, she performed her compulsory figures flawlessly and her free skate routine was replayed on newsreels internationally.\nBarbara Ann Scott doll from the Museum\u2019s collection. Canadian Museum of History, 983.29.23, S89-1870-Dp1\nThe Canadian skater had already gained national attention, but her Olympic Games success made her an even bigger celebrity. On her return to Ottawa, she was greeted by an estimated 60,000 fans \u2014 including Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King.\nScott subsequently appeared in advertisements for Canada Dry, Timex and Community Silverplate China, and was a guest on What\u2019s My Line, an American television program. She turned professional shortly after the Olympics, travelling internationally as the headliner of the Hollywood Ice Revue.\nCanadian children who came of age in the 1950s and 1960s might best remember the skater from the Barbara Ann Scott doll. Manufactured by the Reliable Toy Company of Toronto, and available through the Eaton\u2019s catalogue, the doll remained popular long after Scott\u2019s Olympic victory.\nDifferent versions of the doll were available. The Canadian Museum of History has two of the dolls in its collection, one with a pink dress and the other with a blue lace dress. Each shimmering costume has faux-fur trim and comes with tiny skates and a headpiece, inspired by ensembles Scott wore during her career. The skater loved her costumes so much that she dedicated an entire chapter of her 1950 autobiography Skate with Me to the subject.\nDolls are playthings, but they also reflect the culture and time period in which they are created. One difference between the real Scott and the doll is its age: the skater\u2019s toy likeness is a baby. In the early 20th century, new theories of child development suggested that children got the most out of toys that they could identify with. Toy makers took this concept to heart, and baby dolls replaced the \u201cfashion dolls\u201d of earlier decades.\nReliable Toy Company catalogue from 1951. Canadian Museum of History, IMG2009-0441-0013-Dm\nTeenaged dolls would come back into fashion in the 1960s, thanks to Barbie. But the Olympic gold medal winner was immortalized as a young child. This likeness certainly reflected media depictions of Scott, who was seen as the embodiment of feminine charm in the postwar era. For example, in 1948 Time magazine suggested that Scott looked like a \u201cdoll which is to be looked at but not touched.\u201d\nAlthough Scott was known and loved for her Olympic success, she had many other laudable accomplishments. She was the 1947 and 1948 European and World women\u2019s figure skating champion, and \u2014 in 1945, 1947 and 1948 \u2014 winner of the Lou Marsh Trophy, Canada\u2019s newspaper editors\u2019 award for athlete of the year. She was also the first woman to land a double lutz in a skating competition. Off the ice, Scott was a licensed pilot and avid golfer.\nIn 1955, Scott married Thomas King and retired from skating. Later in life, she excelled as an equestrian, owned a beauty salon and was a torchbearer at the 1988 and 2010 Winter Olympic Games, in Calgary and Vancouver respectively.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/dog-sled-en-route-to-coppermine-river/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Dog sled en route to Coppermine River", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-02-04 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Frits Johansen (1882-1957), 42241\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/barbara-ann-scott-doll/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Barbara Ann Scott doll", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-02-04 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 983.29.23, S89-1870-Dp1\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/labrador-1927/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Labrador, 1927", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-01-28 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, unknown photographer, 75-12504-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/formed-planar-chaise-lounge/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Formed planar chaise lounge", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-01-28 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 2006.68.1, D2007-12171.\nAlthough this chaise lounge was fashioned some 40 years ago, it looks as though it could be an avant-garde product of the 21st\u00a0century.

We love it, we hate it; it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s a nuisance. Whether it sparks a sense of wonder or dread, there\u2019s no denying that snow has helped shape the Canadian identity. Snow was a relentless challenge that the first European settlers had to adapt to as soon as they arrived in Canada. Thanks to the expertise of Aboriginal peoples, they learned to live with it.\nNowadays, snow removal after a heavy storm is routine. \u201cThis is why we have a hard time imagining what life was like back then, when the snow settled on the ground for the winter,\u201d says Bianca Gendreau, curator of Snow, a travelling exhibition that was first presented at the Museum in 2014. She adds: \u201cWe forget how difficult it was to get out and about.\u201d Very early on, the settlers adopted the snowshoe, an ingenious First Nations\u2019 invention that enabled them to walk on snow. They also adopted the sled, which was used to transport game and other items.\nSnowshoes, 1850\u20131912. Canadian Museum of History, 2009.5.2a, 74.757.1, D-5384, IMG2013-0142-0004-Dm\nLater, Canadians started to come up with their own snow-related inventions. Horses got snowshoes: rounded wooden planks that were fitted onto their horseshoes with leather straps. The horses could then pull scrapers, which flattened down the snow. Shovels became all-important in cities where major streets needed to be cleared. Teams of men were recruited to shovel the snow into sleds, which were then taken away and emptied. Gendreau says that during the 19th century, the number of patents registered for more efficient snow shovels was astounding!\nIn the 1800s, the shovel was the main tool used to remove snow. Canadian Museum of History, 73-941, A-836, 72-1354, IMG2013-0142-0043-Dm\nThe introduction of the internal combustion engine brought more innovations. These included Arthur Sicard\u2019s snow blower, which was used to remove snow from streets in the early 1900s, as well as Joseph-Armand Bombardier\u2019s famous snow vehicle and then his snowmobile, which is hugely popular today for recreational use. An appreciation of snow is far from new. In the 19th century, many snowshoe clubs were established, all with their own songs and outfits. It comes as no surprise that today one out of ten Canadians participates in at least one winter sport.\nHorse snowshoes, circa 1900. Canadian Museum of History, A-1153, IMG2013-0142-0018-Dm\nGendreau\u2019s hope is that visitors leave the Snow exhibition with an appreciation for the important role that this element has played in the lives of Canadians: \u201cLove it or hate it, snow is part of the cycle of life. Its thick cover protects seeds from the ravages of frost. And its spring melt helps replenish our waterways. It is part of a vast natural balance.\u201d\nIndeed, how could anyone remain unmoved by the ethereal beauty of light snow falling on a winter\u2019s eve?\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/buffalo-and-elk/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Wood Buffalo National Park", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-01-07 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Rudolph Martin Anderson, 74950 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/seal-and-caribou-skin-boots/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Seal and caribou skin\u00a0boots", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-01-07 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, IV-D-871, IMG2013-0142-0012-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/children-playing-tag/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Children playing skipping rope", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-12-31 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Diamond Jenness, 37037\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/horse-robe/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Horse robe", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-12-31 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, V-E-281, IMG2009-0063-0032-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/x-mas-at-nain/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "X-mas at Nain", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-12-24 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, unknown photographer, 75-12500-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/shipping-cattle/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Shipping cattle", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-12-17 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, unknown photographer, 37.24 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/renewing-a-living-church/", "category": "Canadian History Hall", "title": "Renewing a living church", "author": "James Trepanier, Ph.D.", "timestamp": "2017-12-14 00:00:00", "text": "St. Onuphrius Ukrainian Catholic Church is one of the \u201ccan\u2019t miss\u201d features of the new Canadian History Hall.

Canadian Museum of History, IMG2017-0341-0013-Dm\nBuilt in phases between 1915 and 1928, and renovated periodically by the parish over the next 30 years, St. Onuphrius provided a space where Ukrainian Catholics living in the rural community of Barich, Alberta (near the town of Smoky Lake, northeast of Edmonton), could follow the devotional practices and the liturgical cycles that structured their lives. In 1995\u20131996, it was dismantled board by board, transported to Gatineau and rebuilt in the Museum\u2019s Canada Hall, where it remained a consecrated, living church that helped tell the story of Ukrainian settlement on the Canadian Prairies.\nDuring the construction phase of the new Hall, the church was the only structure left standing in the space, as it was too large to remove. Throughout the construction process, the exterior was carefully protected with scaffolding and a protective shell.\nAll of the artifacts \u2014 liturgical items, furniture, etc. \u2014 were removed from the interior of the church. For this step, the Museum worked closely with religious leaders from the Ukrainian Catholic Church to ensure that the artifacts were handled with the appropriate care and respect. A crucial element of this care and protection was the removal of the antymension, or antymins, from the altar in the sanctuary.\nThe antymins is a small, decorated silken or linen cloth with a small pocket for a holy relic. It is kept under the top altar cloth. Without the antymins and its holy relic, the Divine Liturgy cannot be celebrated, making it one of the holiest objects in a consecrated Ukrainian Catholic church. Before the construction process began in earnest, the antymins was carefully removed by a priest in a small ceremony and handed over, for care and protection, to our collections and conservation staff.\nThe exhibition construction team then moved the church to a new area of the exhibition space. The process took a few days of very careful work. As you can see in this time-lapse video of the Hall\u2019s construction, the exhibition then came to life around it.\nAs the official opening of the Canadian History Hall approached in the spring of 2017, the Museum team worked with the Ukrainian Catholic community to determine the best way to reopen the church and the proper ceremony for reinstalling the antymins on the altar. Church leaders suggested that late September would be an ideal time, as they intended to gather at that time for an annual conference nearby.\nA special procession of religious clergy bearing the antymins moved from the Hub to the church at the beginning of the service. Canadian Museum of History, IMG2017-0353-0014-Dm\nA special reopening service was held on the morning of September 30, attended by the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Canadian Ukrainian Catholic Church, the Most Reverend Lawrence Huculak, O.S.B.M., as well as by a delegation of bishops, priests and seminarians; members of the original parish in Smoky Lake, Alberta; and members of the wider Ukrainian\u2013Canadian community. After a procession to the church, a special religious service marked its reopening and the return of the antymins to the altar. The service had special meaning for Archbishop Huculak \u2014 as a young priest he had attended the special final service held in the church before it was moved to the Museum in 1995\u20131996.\nArchbishop Lawrence Huculak, Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Catholic Church in Canada, leads the service inside St. Onuphrius.

There are many ways to do this, from intensive walking surveys, historical records, and Indigenous oral histories and traditional knowledge, to computer modelling, remote sensing and, finally, aerial photos or satellite imagery. However, one often overlooked source of information is the knowledge of local residents who live in the study area and have encountered archaeological sites near their homes.\nA new Canadian Museum of History project involves looking for sites on the South Shore of Nova Scotia, where coastal erosion \u2014 caused by rising sea levels and climate change \u2014 is endangering archaeological sites. This erosion is so severe that many sites discovered only decades ago have now been completely destroyed.\nThe new project aims to find and excavate the remaining sites before they are literally swept out to sea. This initiative is being undertaken in close collaboration with the Acadia First Nation, whose history is the most endangered by this erosion.\nThe inaugural season of the COASTAL* Archaeology Project was launched in the last weeks of August, 2017. Our aim was to visit and assess known sites and survey for new sites. Surveying is very time-consuming and, given the level of erosion on the coast, any delay literally means the loss of more information. We decided to appeal to the public to help us find sites before they are completely lost to erosion.\nArchaeologists inspect and identify objects brought in by the public during the What\u2019s the Point event. Canadian Museum of History\nOn August 22, we held an event at the Harrison Lewis Coastal Discovery Centre, in the middle of our survey territory, which we called \u201cWhat\u2019s the Point: Archaeology Show and Learn.\u201d We invited anyone who lives on the South Shore to come to the centre with any ancient artifact or \u201ctreasure\u201d that they may have found. With the collaboration of the Nova Scotia Museum, we offered to inspect and identify each object and determine how old it was, in return for any information the finder could remember about where it was found, and in what context.\nThe turnout was better than we ever could have wished and, despite the remote location, almost 40 people showed up with about a dozen collections. People brought their artifacts packed carefully in containers such as fishing tackle boxes and Tupperware. One person even had his display preserved under glass in his coffee table.\nThe results of this event were incredible! People showed us stone points and axes they had found which dated to more than 3,500 years ago. A large collection of hundreds of ceramic fragments dated to the mid-19th century. One individual brought items he had found which spanned a period from about 4,000\u00a0years ago right up to the arrival of Europeans.\nIn the end, participants in this event revealed about 10 sites that had never been identified by archaeologists \u2014 sites that will be the focus of investigations in coming seasons.\nSome brought in objects that turned out to be curiously worn stones, but the information they shared is no less useful. Knowing where not to look is as important as knowing where to focus our attention.\nSome of the artifacts brought in by the public during the What\u2019s the Point show and tell event. Canadian Museum of History\nWhile our goal to learn about new sites was successfully achieved, another goal \u2014 community outreach \u2014 was met with equal success. Learning about the artifacts they had recovered, some found many decades ago, is important to those who are so interested in their local history. At the same time, we took the opportunity to educate our visitors about what they should do if they find more artifacts.\nSuch engagement is a crucial part of archaeology; there are no better stewards of the archaeological past than the people who live on the land where it is buried.\nAn example of coastal erosion threatening archaeological sites on Nova Scotia\u2019s South Shore. Canadian Museum of History\nWhat should I do if I find an artifact?\nIf you do discover an artifact, you should not disturb the site further or \u201cdig\u201d for other artifacts, as doing so will only cause more destruction to the site. Instead, report your find to the provincial authorities. Visit the Nova Scotia Office of Special Places website for more information about the Special Places Protection Act, as well as for contact information.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/gold-rush/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Gold Rush", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-11-26 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Joseph Burr Tyrrell, 5816\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/the-bear-hunters/", "category": "Collection", "title": "The Bear Hunters", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-11-26 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, IV-C-3610, IMG2009-0063-0035-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/kamouraska/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Kamouraska", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-11-19 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Henri Durand, S73-4350\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/queen-victorias-cameo-locket/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Queen Victoria\u2019s cameo locket", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-11-19 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, H-203, S95-06821\nThis cameo locket belonged to Her Majesty Queen Victoria and was given to one of her maids-in-waiting, Mrs. Mary Downing Williams, who immigrated to British Columbia in the early 1900s.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/riels-handcuffs-sober-reminder-of-dark-chapter-2/", "category": "Canadian History Hall", "title": "Riel\u2019s handcuffs \u201csober reminder of dark chapter\u201d", "author": "Sylvain Raymond", "timestamp": "2017-11-15 00:00:00", "text": "At first glance, there seems nothing particularly remarkable about this artifact \u2014 a pair of standard handcuffs from the late 19th century.

Many Indigenous people hailed him as a champion of their rights and aspirations against an aggressive colonial state. They saw his execution as the start of a new regime that would subject them to an unprecedented degree of political, social and cultural control.\nThe execution also marked a low point in relations between French and English Canadians. The former commonly saw the fate of Riel \u2014 a French-speaking Catholic \u2014 as proof that their language and culture were being persecuted outside Quebec.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/totem-poles-along-the-skeena-river/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Totem poles along the Skeena River", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-11-12 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Harlan Ingersoll Smith, PR2003-001\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/magistrates-robe/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Magistrate\u2019s robe", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-11-12 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 2013.54.1, IMG2016-0106-0025-Dm\nThis robe was supposedly worn by magistrate Hugh\u00a0Richardson when he presided over the trial of Louis Riel for high treason in July\u00a01885.

The collection includes some of the finest works by many of the best Ontario decoy carvers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \u201cIt\u2019s a collection you wouldn\u2019t put together again easily, if ever,\u201d Dr. Stewart said.\nAbout a decade ago, he was \u201cgetting on\u201d in age and wondering what to do with the collection. \u201cIt\u2019s not the sort of thing you\u2019d leave to your children or grandchildren,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole idea of building a personal collection is the fun and excitement of putting it together.\u201d He also ruled out the idea of selling the birds.

After all, he thought, hunting for subsistence or sport has been an important part of the Canadian experience, a fact that should be reflected in Canada\u2019s national museum of human history. Dr. Stewart and his collections were greeted by the Museum with enthusiasm. The shotguns were accepted several years ago; the decoys more recently.\n\u201cWhen someone like Dr. Stewart comes along with an impeccably researched and inventoried collection of such quality, you just can\u2019t turn it down,\u201d said Dr. Laura Sanchini, Curator, Craft Design and Popular Culture at the Museum.

This National Historic Site, discovered with the aid of carefully preserved Inuit oral histories, recognizes the historical importance of the wrecks, as well as their Inuit connection. While researchers from Parks Canada and the Government of Nunavut continue to investigate the sites, visitors to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, have since July 2017 been learning more in a new exhibition, Death in the Ice. The exhibition, developed by the Canadian Museum of History along with partners that include Parks Canada, the National Maritime Museum, the Government of Nunavut, and the Inuit Heritage Trust, opens at the Canadian Museum of History on March 2, 2018.\nThe introductory area of Death in the Ice at the National Maritime Museum includes an Inuit carving of a European ship (foreground).\nPhoto: Canadian Museum of History.\nEarly on, the exhibition team \u2014 Claire Champ (Creative Development Specialist), Danielle Goyer (Project Manager), Kerry McMaster (Scenographer/Designer), and Karen Ryan (Curator) \u2014 recognized that the story of Franklin\u2019s 1845 expedition could only be told by acknowledging the role of Inuit experts in understanding what happened to the expedition. The reason for this is simple: Inuit were the last to see the ships and their crews. And those encounters, preserved in oral histories and shared with Parks Canada and its partners, contributed directly to the discovery of HMS Erebus and Terror.\nA deliberate decision was thus made that some of the first artifacts encountered in the exhibition be Inuit. These include a full-sized kayak, male and female summer outfits, a small wooden carving of a 16th-century European ship, and a variety of tools made from local Arctic materials. Alongside these objects \u2014 all from the Canadian Museum of History \u2014 are similar examples from the National Maritime Museum. However, the latter Inuit artifacts differ in one important respect: they were made with wood and metal from the Franklin expedition.\nInuit summer outfits and a kayak, all more than 100 years old, at the National Maritime Museum. The listening station (bottom right) features Louie Kamookak speaking about the ongoing importance of the Inuit oral history tradition.

This audio is based on an interview with Mark Tootiak, conducted by Dorothy Harley Eber in 1999, describing meetings between expedition crewmen and Inuit after Erebus and Terror were abandoned. This account, and another by Inookie Adamie in 1998, are featured in listening stations later in the exhibition, and are also included in Dorothy\u2019s book Encounters on the Passage: Inuit Meet the Explorers. Her original Northwest Passage interviews, comprising 81 audiotapes, are now in the Canadian Museum of History Archives.\nA showcase at the National Maritime Museum featuring Inuit objects made with locally available resources, alongside those using materials from the Franklin Expedition.

Louie\u2019s knowledge of oral histories \u2014 particularly those concerning the Northwest Passage \u2014 is unmatched, and his efforts to assemble this information have helped reveal what ultimately happened to the expedition. Louie also provided important cultural context about why the oral transmission of accurate and detailed knowledge remains a key part of Inuit life.\nAn oral history listening station, featuring Heather Campbell\u2019s illustrations, at the National Maritime Museum.

On October 10, another FLQ cell sprang into action, kidnapping Pierre Laporte, Quebec\u2019s Minister of Labour. That sort of thing was unheard of in Canada. Rumours abounded. Was it the beginning of an insurrection? Was Quebec going to become another Cuba or another Northern Ireland? The Canadian Army was called in to back up the police force, whose officers were exhausted.\nCanadian History Hall display on the FLQ and the October Crisis.

It was the first time civil liberties were suspended in Canada outside the context of war. Some 500 people were arrested and detained without a warrant. The following day, Laporte\u2019s kidnappers responded by killing their hostage. It was the first political assassination in Canada since the murder of Thomas D\u2019Arcy McGee in 1868. Fortunately, Cross was released on December 3.\nThis somber period is presented in the new Canadian History Hall with texts, images and audiovisual material, accompanied by artifacts.

The Canadian players were coming off their summer vacation and they saw the series as a sort of training camp for their upcoming season. No Western journalists had press passes to cover hockey in the Soviet Union, so few people had any idea of the strength of the Soviet leagues. By comparison, Soviet players and coaches knew all about Canadian hockey \u2014 the team had been training year-round in preparation for the upcoming series.\nThe first four games were played in Canadian cities and the final four in Moscow. When the Soviets won the first game with 7 goals to 3, many Canadians were shocked. Team Canada won game 2 but they did not play well. Game 3 was a tie and the Soviets won games 4 and 5. After Canada\u2019s loss in game 4 in Vancouver, the team was booed off the ice. The Canadians won the final three games to win the series 4 games to 3, with one tie.

In 1968, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau established a task force that led to the formation of Hockey Canada. Hockey Canada would be an umbrella organization representing the sport in Canada and abroad. Within a few years, Trudeau and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin agreed that an international hockey competition would be a good way to improve relations between the two countries, and planning for the 1972 Summit Series began. Hockey diplomacy was the goal of the series, but each side was deeply invested in victory. Many saw the series \u2014 which was played during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the West \u2014 as a battle between \u201cus and them.\u201d\nAn estimated 13 million Canadians \u2014 out of a population of 21 million \u2014 watched the final game on television. Children were allowed to watch at school and some businesses shut down so that people could watch at home.\nSouvenir banner, game ticket and puck from the 1972 Summit Series.

But what can it tell us about our early Canadian roots? Answering this question is the focus of the online exhibition,\u00a0The Harbinson Collection\u00a0\u2013 A Passion for Canadian Furniture and Decorative Arts.\nThe jug is a one-of-a-kind \u201charvest ring\u201d showstopper, made in Bruce County, Ontario, by the Brownscombe family of potters more than 140 years ago. Harvest rings are unusual, a design traditionally meant to be carried on the arm.

In Quebec, along the Niagara Peninsula, in the Maritimes and elsewhere in Eastern Canada, immigrant artisans adapted to their surroundings, often using local materials to recreate designs from their countries of origin. And once relocated, regional design variations soon followed.\nPennsylvania Germans moved north after the American Revolution, bringing their weaving techniques with them. Scottish cabinet-makers reflected Chippendale designs in their chests of drawers, but altered the knobs to better match prevalent Victorian tastes. French immigrants adapted decorative traditions to create diamond-point designs in what is now Quebec, where the style maintained its popularity long after it had passed in France. An experienced eye can follow the story of immigrant families and artisans through the objects they passed down from generation to generation.\nCollecting the story along with the object was important to John and Heather Harbinson when they first started acquiring early Canadian domestic furniture and decorative arts in the 1960s. Sifting through second-hand shops, jumping on weekend auction finds and developing relationships with savvy antique dealers, the Harbinsons carefully added to a stunning, world-class collection. Their criteria? Each piece had to have a strong and verifiable history, display excellent workmanship and utilize identifiable, made-by-hand techniques.\nChessboard\n1800s\nMaple\nCanadian Museum of History, 2007.22.53\nChessboard\n1800s\nMaple\nCanadian Museum of History, 2007.22.53\nTheir stringent adherence to these values makes the Harbinsons\u2019 collection one of the best of its kind in Canada.

As part of that story, the exhibition team wanted to shine a light on multiple identities \u2014 not only within a country but, also, within an individual.\nAs curator James Trepanier explains it, \u201cPeople wear multiple layers of identity at once.\u201d To illustrate this idea, the Museum chose to include a modern-art installation by Laila Binbrek, an artist of Yemeni ancestry who was born in Kitchener, Ontario, has lived in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, England and Canada, and now makes the United Arab Emirates home. The Museum had commissioned a piece by Binbrek for its 2001 exhibition The Lands within Me: Expressions by Canadian Artists of Arab Origin.\nBinbrek\u2019s Mirror, Mirror is composed of two dressing tables covered with various items that reflect how the many elements of her identity, including her faith, intersect. The items include a veil, cosmetic products, magazines, slippers, candles, sweets and jewellery. The tables face each other, with a mirror frame in the centre that Binbrek purposely left empty to highlight the flow between her different identities. The piece reflects the artist\u2019s search for balance between these identities, including the daily decisions she makes about how to present herself to the world.\nMirror, Mirror art installation by artist Laila Binbrek featured in the Canadian History Hall. Photo: Canadian Museum of History\nTrepanier wanted to re-use this piece in Gallery 3 because it evokes the complicated nature of identity. However, when object conservator Jennifer Ann Mills completed her assessment and examination of the installation, she realized they had a problem. Many of the objects on the tables were in various states of decay. The cosmetics containers, for example, were sticky: a sign that the plastic was deteriorating. Decaying plastic can leach chemicals that could prove harmful to Museum staff, visitors and nearby objects. Other cosmetic items, such as a container of blush, and food items, such as a tub of strawberry sweets from a factory in Bahrain, were mouldy. Bottles of body wash and lotion had dried up.\nMills had two main considerations in approaching this conservation challenge. First, she had to make sure the items would not pose a risk to people or to other objects. Second, it was crucial that she maintain the artist\u2019s original intention, which was certainly not to present two dressing tables of expired cosmetics.\nReplacement items used for Laila Binbrek\u2019s Mirror, Mirror art installation. Photo: Canadian Museum of History.\nMills was able to perform a simple cleaning on the inorganic objects, like the jewellery, but she knew she had to replace the organic products and decaying plastics. To do this, she worked closely with Binbrek, emailing photographs and consulting with her extensively about replacement items. Mills cut no corners in this process. Collections information specialist Anneh Fletcher went to great lengths to source replacement items from their original localities, where possible. The team ordered incense balls, cubes of musk and rose-petal powder from the Middle East. It was not always possible to find an exact replica. For the strawberry sweets from Bahrain, for example, the team had to make a replica, keeping the original container but filling it with imitation candies made of cardboard.\nMost of us have lost track of a cosmetic item over the years, only to discover it dried or sticky in the bottom of a drawer. Or maybe we\u2019ve been give an ancient-seeming candy by a well-meaning grandparent. Whereas we would simply fire the offending item into the trash, members of the Museum\u2019s conservation team face more complicated challenges and, luckily for us, they take their jobs seriously. The original artifacts from this installation that are no longer suitable for display are now maintained in reserve collections under optimum environmental conditions to help ensure their long-term preservation.\nReplacement items used for Laila Binbrek\u2019s Mirror, Mirror art installation.

During the process of repatriating his remains to Nunavut, we discovered evidence suggesting that he had revealed his life story in pictograms. We wanted to share that story with our visitors, but it was important to us that we did so from an Indigenous perspective.\nFirst, we presented this story to the modern community of Arctic Bay, the closest community to his burial location. We asked them if they would allow us, with their collaboration, to tell his story in the new Canadian History Hall.\nThe reconstruction of Nuvumiutaq displayed in the Canadian History Hall. Photo: Canadian Museum of History\nThe response from the community was extremely positive, and we began working closely with them to develop an effective means of telling his story. Community Elders named him Nuvumiutaq, which means \u201cperson from the peninsula,\u201d a reference to his burial location. We believed that reconstructing his face would prompt interest in who this man was, and the Inuit agreed. To respectfully reconstruct his face, the Inuit gave us detailed instructions on how they wanted his hair, skin, and expression to look, and they provided us with detailed historical photos for reference. For his expression, the Inuit indicated that they wanted him to \u201clook proud, looking out on the land, remembering his past.\u201d\nWith these instructions, we laser-scanned his skull and sent a plastic replica to Atelier Daynes in France, which was able to produce a forensically accurate reconstruction of his face, along with the expression requested by the community. The process was iterative, and feedback was necessary to get his hair, skin tone and expression just right.\nDr. Young provided details on his height, weight, and musculature to both the community and to the forensic artist. A community Elder, Olayuk\u00a0Kigutikakjuk, offered to produce traditional sealskin clothing for the reconstruction. The final touch was to add a walking stick, which we made from a piece of aged wood. The result was a strikingly lifelike mannequin of a real Inuit man who lived 800 years ago.\nMembers of the Arctic Bay community and the Inuit Heritage Trust attend a private unveiling ceremony in April 2017.

We are currently producing an archive package of the archaeological research and forensic reconstruction for use by the community and its local school.

The Hall\u2019s opening stories, broadly chronological and thematic, deal with the archaeological history of the Indigenous peoples of Canada. Unfortunately, archaeological collections rarely reveal individual histories and, moreover, tend to be interpreted from a Western, scientific perspective. In contrast, we wanted to tell these stories from an Indigenous perspective, and we wanted to connect our visitors to an individual from the past in a way that felt personal and less distant.\nIn this first post of two, you will learn about the story of an Inuit man who lived eight centuries ago. In the second, you will learn how we collaborated with Indigenous partners to bring that man face-to-face with Museum visitors, and with Indigenous communities.\nFirst, let\u2019s take a look at the story.\nWhen this man\u2019s skeletal remains were collected, nearly 60 years ago, Western researchers did not typically collaborate or consult with Indigenous communities. Now, his remains, and the objects with which he was interred, are being repatriated to Nunavut. As part of that process, Dr. Janet Young conducted a detailed analysis of his skeletal remains, discovering much about his life history and revealing important connections to the artifacts buried with him.\nNuvumiutaq was buried with his hunting equipment, including a bow-drill incised with scenes that may illustrate events from his personal life. Muscle and trauma marks on his skeleton corroborate the picture of a skilled kayaker and hunter who lived an eventful life. Photo: Canadian Museum of History\nThe man was in his early forties when he died, and was buried with a spectacular array of artifacts, most likely made of walrus ivory. One of these \u2014 a bow drill \u2014 was inscribed with dozens of pictographs, representing hunting scenes, animals, human conflict and village life. When these scenes were compared to the traumas and adaptive changes on his skeleton, we noticed many distinct connections.\nFirst, the man had a condition known as \u201cKayaker\u2019s clavicle,\u201d which matched with the myriad scenes of kayaking on the bow drill. Furthermore, the man\u2019s arm bones showed evidence that he had repeatedly lifted a heavy object in an unusual position, which accorded with scenes depicting a whaling captain holding a heavy harpoon. Finally, he had severely injured his legs and spine, and would have needed the aid of a walking stick. The bow drill depicts an individual moving among tents with a walking stick.\nThese connections suggested to us that the bow drill might depict the life story of the man with whom it was buried. In fact, one end of the bow drill shows a child playing among tents, while the other end shows an older individual with a walking stick. Did this bow drill feature an autobiography of the man who made it?\nThe finished reconstruction of Nuvumiutaq, an Inuit man who lived in the Canadian Arctic 800 years ago. Photo: Canadian Museum of History\nIt seems that this man chose to record his history in pictograms and now, eight centuries later, we wanted to share that compelling story. The question now was how to tell it in a way that prioritized an Indigenous perspective and revealed the individuality of this man.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/codenamed-quadrant/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Code Name \u201cQUADRANT\u201d", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-08-20 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, unknown photographer, IMG2014-0056-0001-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/goshawk-with-chipmunk/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Goshawk with Chipmunk", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-08-20 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 86-98, IMG2009-0063-0153-Dm\nAcquired with funds from The Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Family Foundation.\nIn 1984, William Hazzard (1933\u20132000) received the Saidye Bronfman Award for excellence in the fine crafts in recognition of works such as Goshawk with Chipmunk.

Situated on Lake Ontario, the fort was constructed from wooden palisades and later walled with stone. The first ships to sail on Lake Ontario were built in the fort\u2019s harbour.\nFor the next 150 years, the area would be a hotly contested region. The Iroquois viewed the soldiers in Fort Frontenac as a threat and besieged the fort in 1688. In the spring of that year, weakened by scurvy, the soldiers abandoned the post. The bodies of some of the fallen were discovered almost 300 years later during a construction project.\nDuring the New France era, Aboriginal Peoples would trade fur for a variety of merchandise including European glass beads like these ones found on an archaeological site at Fort Frontenac. Photo: Andrew Wollin, BFC Kingston\nThe French re-occupied the fort several years later, part of ambitious colonial plans stretching from Nova Scotia to the Gulf of Mexico. During the Seven Years War, British forces captured Fort Frontenac and attempted to demolish the stone work.\nIn the years that followed the handover of New France to Britain, military operations on Lake Ontario shifted first to Carleton Island and later to Fort Henry across the mouth of the Cataraqui River from the old French stronghold. The former Fort Frontenac fell into disuse. Through the years, the harbour was filled in. During the War of 1812, new barracks were built on top of the old fort. Today, the Canadian Forces Staff College occupies the same location.\nA site with this much history is bound to leave evidence. The vast collection of recovered materials includes artifacts from every era, ranging from gun flints to well-preserved leather shoes and bags.\n\u201cThe military hardware is balanced by items of everyday use that remind us that even on distant frontiers, people still had need for familiar things from home. Clothing and pieces of fine decorative ceramics such as faience allowed people to recreate some of what they\u2019d left behind,\u201d says Pilon.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/archaeology-month/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Archaeology Month", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-08-06 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Marius Barbeau, 19899\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/golf-equipment/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Golf equipment", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-08-06 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 994.23.48, 994.6.56, 995.4.6, IMG2009-0063-0030-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/solving-a-northern-mystery-2/", "category": "Museum Research", "title": "Solving a northern mystery", "author": "\u00c9liane Laberge", "timestamp": "2017-08-02 00:00:00", "text": "In 1954 at Native Point, Southampton Island, in what is now Nunavut, a Smithsonian archeologist excavated a partially exposed female skeleton with signs of severe trauma to the skull. The woman belonged to the Sadlermiut, an extremely isolated Inuit group that in the winter of 1902 was decimated by an infectious disease introduced by a whaling boat. No one at Native Point survived the winter.\nThe skull trauma was originally described as bullet holes. However, as the Museum was preparing the remains of the Sadlermiut woman for repatriation to Nunavut, the idea for the 3D project emerged. \u201cWe noticed that the damage to her skull wasn\u2019t consistent with a bullet,\u201d says Karen Ryan, the Museum of History\u2019s Curator for Northern Canada. \u201cWe suspected that she\u2019d been attacked by an animal. We needed a way to confirm this while also treating her with respect by minimizing our handling of her fragile remains.\u201d\nA virtual solution\nThe Museum team tasked with solving the mystery of the Sadlermiut woman first documented her injuries. They then created a three-dimensional digital model of her skull. Next, they sent this model to colleagues at the Idaho Virtualization Laboratory, who imported it into a virtual environment where they could use the Virtual Zooarchaeology of the Arctic Project, an online repository of high-resolution 3D models of 169 northern mammals.\nThe next step was to compare the virtual human skull damage with the virtual jaws of four predators: northern tundra wolf, black bear, grizzly bear and polar bear. Digital modelling can highlight details that might be overlooked or otherwise remain invisible with conventional techniques, but it had never been used to investigate skeletal trauma. As well as matching an animal jaw model to the skull damage in this digital environment, the laboratory team worked with Museum researchers to generate an attack sequence that likely produced the fatal wounds.\nThe team\u2019s groundbreaking digital analysis pointed to the most terrifying of the four predators \u2014 a polar bear.\n\u201cTo our knowledge, this is the first time archaeologists have used a virtual 3D environment to identify the species of an animal attack from human remains.

How these seals ended up in North American fur-trade forts speaks to Indigenous people\u2019s rapid adoption of European textiles.\nFrench bale seal, early 1700s, Mackinac State Historic Parks, United States\nMany Canadians are familiar with the European origins of the fur trade: the popularity of fashionable felt hats spurred French and English fur traders to seek North American beavers, whose soft under-fur was particularly suitable for felt-making. However, Indigenous traders and consumers shaped the fur trade as much as their European counterparts did, insisting on high-quality goods in exchange for the beaver pelts they offered as payment.\nCloth was among the most coveted of trade goods. Cloth, clothing and sewing supplies accounted for over half the goods sold at some trading posts. Cloth decomposes easily and therefore rarely survives in archaeological sites; however, the discovery of lead bale seals \u2014 sometimes by the hundreds \u2014 confirms the tremendous volume of cloth that was imported into North America between the 1600s and the 1800s. For Indigenous participants, the \u201cfur trade\u201d was really a \u201ccloth trade.\u201d\nIndigenous people valued cloth of various weights and colours for clothing, blankets and ceremonial regalia. As they did with other goods, Indigenous consumers carefully assessed the quality of the cloth offered to them. If it was defective, they demanded better stock. European traders scrambled to find suppliers to satisfy their Indigenous customers before their competitors could corner the market.\nThe images on the seals in the Canadian History Hall reflect the competition between English and French traders. The seals come from three archaeological sites hundreds of kilometres apart: the French posts at Fort Frontenac (present-day Kingston, Ontario) and Fort Michilimackinac (present-day Mackinaw City, Michigan), and the English post at Fort Albany, Ontario, on James Bay.\nThe three French seals depict fleurs-de-lys and roosters \u2014 typically French symbols. One of the two English seals depicts St. George, the patron saint of England, while the other bears a harp, perhaps the mark of an Irish product. Traders kept tabs on the goods offered by their competitors, and sometimes stocked cloth produced by their rivals in order to satisfy customer demand. Archaeologists occasionally find English seals on the sites of French forts.\nFrench and English traders raced to obtain furs for European hat-makers, but they also competed to supply Indigenous consumers with cloth and other goods. The fur/cloth trade brought European conflict deep into the North American interior, and it brought Indigenous people into the global marketplace.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/gitksan-totem-pole/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Gitksan totem pole", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-07-23 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Harlan Ingersoll Smith, 64327 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/northwest-coast-frontlet/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Northwest Coast frontlet", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-07-23 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, VII-C-1811, IMG2008-0583-0226-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/popular-music-an-integral-part-of-the-canadian-museum-of-historys-collection/", "category": "Collections Management", "title": "Popular music: An integral part of the Museum\u2019s collection", "author": "\u00c9liane Laberge", "timestamp": "2017-07-19 00:00:00", "text": "Radio and television brought popular music into every home and artists attracted thousands of fans through their recordings and concert tours. Now, with the Internet, YouTube and social media it is possible to follow these artists more closely than ever before, learning details about their careers, lifestyles and creative processes.\nThis more or less reflects the Museum of History\u2019s popular music collection. Judith Klassen, Curator, Cultural Expression, oversees the collection that contains thousands of artifacts, recordings and archival documents. It includes numerous genres of commercially broadcast music, from folk to rock, country to jazz and pop to punk. \u201cMany people form personal attachments to popular music,\u201d says Klassen, \u201cbut music also gives us an exceptional way of understanding the social, political and cultural movements within which it developed. By bringing together artifacts and archival documents that show the variety and vitality of contemporary cultural expression in Canada, and by sharing the personal and public impact of popular music, the Museum seeks to deepen Canadians\u2019 awareness of their own stories.\u201d\nMusical instruments, recordings and sheet music\nOne would, of course, hope to find musical instruments in a music collection. In this, the Museum does not disappoint. It has, for example, acquired the KORG synthesizer purchased by Oscar Peterson in 2005, the year it came on the market. The Museum has also acquired instruments from the band Rush, including Neil Peart\u2019s drum kit, Alex Lifeson\u2019s double neck Gibson electric guitar and Geddy Lee\u2019s double neck Rickenbacker. Other treasures in the collection include: Buffy Sainte-Marie\u2019s mouthbow; jazzman Moe Koffman\u2019s flute, used during the 1958 recording of his\u00a0Swingin\u2019 Shepherd Blues; and a clarinet that once belonged to Victor Lombardo, a member of Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians.\nOxford\u00a0synthesizer that belonged to Oscar Peterson. Photo: Canadian Museum of History.\nFans can become true fanatics when it comes to rare and early recordings, sheet music and other bits of musical composition. Within this category, the Museum\u2019s collection includes handwritten lyrics for Rush albums\u00a0Signals\u00a0(1982) and\u00a0Power Windows\u00a0(1985) and a draft of\u00a0Big Yellow Taxi\u00a0by Joni Mitchell.\nThere\u2019s No Business Like Show Business\nStage clothes often have symbolic value and are worn by recording artists to make them stand out or to give them a specific look. For the great Montr\u00e9al-born jazz musician Oscar Peterson, his stage wear always demonstrated his deep and abiding respect for the music. One example in the Museum\u2019s collection is a stunning brocade smoking jacket worn by Peterson at a number of concerts, including his\u00a02003 concert in Vienna.\nOther notable items of clothing in the collection include a pair of the famous Roman togas with capes worn by C\u00e9sar of C\u00e9sar et les Romains, a \u201cy\u00e9y\u00e9\u201d group from the 1960s; stage clothing belonging to Ra McGuire, lead singer for the rock group Trooper; and a costume worn by Shania Twain for the Juno Awards ceremony in 2003.\nCostume worn by Shania Twain for the 2003 Juno Awards ceremony.

The Museum\u2019s music collection includes a program from the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, which marked the electric debut of Bob Dylan along with performances by a number of Canadian artists, and a poster for the Transcontinental Pop Festival, which featured an eccentric array of artists that included The Band, Janis Joplin, Robert Charlebois and Ian and Sylvia Tyson. And a collection like this would not be complete without examples of the many types of awards received by Canadian artists. The collection includes several such prizes, including awards presented to Carole Pope, Rush, Randy Bachman, Trooper and Jim Vallance.\nJoni Mitchell with keyboard, self-portrait, original ink and colored felt tip drawing, 355 x 270 mm, ca.1969\nIMG2015-0144-0025-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/icebreaker-n-b-mclean-leaving/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Icebreaker N.B.

Canadian Museum History, IMG 2015-0037-0001-Dm\nThe mid-1960s was a time of profound change for the Inuit of Canada\u2019s Eastern Arctic as they were moved off the land and into permanent settlements. A witness to that change was Terrence Ryan, then the resident arts advisor at the famous Cape Dorset print studio near the southern end of Baffin Island.\nIn 1964, fearing the loss of traditional Inuit culture, Ryan embarked on an epic, four-month journey by dogsled to the island\u2019s northern tip. Along the way, he distributed drawing paper and colour pencils, and asked people of all ages to record their history, culture, traditions or experiences for posterity.\nHe received 1,842 drawings by 159 individuals, all produced within a span of several months. For many who contributed, it was the first and only time they put pencil to paper. Ryan maintained the collection for 50 years before arranging its transfer to the Canadian Museum of History in 2015.\n\u201cThe drawings are the voice of a people living on the edge of modernity,\u201d says Bianca Gendreau, the Museum\u2019s Manager, Contemporary Canada and the World. \u201cThey provide a glimpse\u2014a time capsule\u2014of a way of life that was changing drastically.

Canadian Museum History, IMG 2015-0037-0001-Dm\nGendreau says the Terrence Peter Ryan Baffin Island Drawing Collection reflects a multiplicity of voices and perspectives. Some of the drawings are by members of the last generation of Inuit who were born on the land, lived in igloos and tents, and travelled by dogsled. Others are by members of the first generation to grow up in permanent communities. Some drawings portray scenes of daily life\u2014new and old\u2014while others depict legends, beliefs and spiritual practices.\n\u201cThere is such a richness in the historical detail,\u201d says Gendreau, making the collection of great value to researchers and others interested in the study and preservation of traditional Inuit culture, including the artists\u2019 descendants.\nGendreau adds that the level of artistry is diverse, ranging from the simple drawings of children to more sophisticated renderings that reflect a wonderful eye for colour and composition, and a high degree of imagination and natural talent. But it\u2019s the documentary value that makes the drawings so precious.\n\u201cThe collection is a library of the experience and knowledge of the people who were living in the north at that time,\u201d says Gendreau, and will help the Museum preserve and present the story of Canada and its people for the benefit of present and future generations.\nInuit drawing from the Terrence Ryan collection, now held by the Canadian Museum of History.

For the past five years, he has been the Hall\u2019s Director of Research and Content. Photo: Canadian Museum of History.\nA few years ago, Dr. David Morrison was thinking of retiring. He had been working at the Museum since the 1980s, and had contributed in countless ways during that long and productive career. But, in 2012, an exciting new project appeared on the horizon. The Museum was going to create a signature gallery that would tell Canada\u2019s story from the dawn of human habitation to the present day. Of course, Dr. Morrison could not say no. He was named the Director of Research and Content for the Canadian History Hall.\nNow, the Hall has been completed, and Dr. Morrison is going to retire \u2014 for certain this time. We sat down with him to speak about his many accomplishments at the Museum, including his most recent contributions to the Canadian History Hall, which opened on July 1.\nYou\u2019ve spent the last five years as the Director of Research and Content for the largest and most comprehensive exhibition on Canadian history ever undertaken. Some might think you\u2019re a historian. In fact, you\u2019ve spent most of your career as an archaeologist. Can you tell us more about your background?\nI always think of myself as having had three careers at the Museum. The first one was as an archaeologist. I spent 20 summers working in the Arctic for the Museum, starting in the early 1980s. Career number two at the Museum was in the late 1990s, when I became the Director of the Archaeology Division, which merged with [the Division of] History in 2002. Then, I was the Director of the Archaeology and History Division until 2012. The third stage in my career began in 2012, when the Hall appeared on the horizon, and I became the research director of that.\nIn addition to working on the First Peoples Hall and the Canadian History Hall, you curated many exhibitions at the Museum. What are the challenges of developing a large, permanent exhibition like the Canadian History Hall, compared with a temporary exhibition?\nThe challenges really revolve around scope. With a temporary exhibition, your content is a specific, bite-sized piece. For example, the last temporary exhibition I did was on the fur trade in Canada, but it was on the fur trade in Canada between 1779 and 1821. It wasn\u2019t the whole history of the fur trade, much less the whole history of Canada!\nWith a gallery like the Canadian History Hall, you have to be comprehensive. The subject matter can be overwhelming. How do you arrange it? How do you make a narrative out of it? How do you divide it up? What do you choose to show? And what do you choose not to show? Because you\u2019ve got a much larger scope, the decision-making process is a lot more complicated.\nHow did you decide on the best way to represent 15,000 years of history in just 40,000 square feet?\nActually, when you really look at it, because we\u2019ve got the central hub and the ramp, the real exhibit space in the Hall is about 30,000, which seems awfully big. When we started, it seemed practically infinite, but it\u2019s not.\nWe had a whole team working on what to say and how to say it. Galleries 1 and 2, which deal with everything up to 1914, were relatively straightforward. We decided to tell the story of Canada in specific sections, or what we call stories \u2014 for instance, the Path to Confederation, or New France \u2014 and it was easy enough to arrange these topics in overlapping chronology. But when we got to Gallery 3, on modern Canada (from 1914 to the present day), it became much more challenging. If we were doing this period 200 years from now, it would be easy; you could look back at it like looking down the lens of a telescope. But it is very difficult to break it up into stories when you\u2019re close to it, like we are. It\u2019s in living memory, and everyone has different opinions about it.\nIt seems that you reconciled these different opinions by telling Canada\u2019s history using multiple perspectives. How did that come about?\nWhen the Canadian History Hall\u2019s predecessor, the Canada Hall, was created, many people believed that it was impossible to represent controversial issues in a museum setting without arousing too much criticism. Consequently, the Canada Hall used a streetscape, walk-through approach to Canadian history that focused on showing scenes from the Canadian past, rather than on specific events, especially contentious ones.\nBut in 2012, the Canadian War Museum put on its 1812 exhibition, and we were very impressed by its presentation of difficult events using multiple perspectives. That exhibition showed us the way.\nThe meaning you derive from these events, and even what is positive and what is negative, depends so much on who you are \u2014 your demographic, what your parents taught you, whether you\u2019re English or French or Indigenous or Ukrainian or Chinese or Catholic or Protestant, and so on. It was very important to us from the beginning that we not privilege one perspective over another.\nWhat makes you most proud of the Hall?\nThe really detailed, in-depth consultation we did with lndigenous people. It was far greater than what we did with the First Peoples Hall. There was far more engagement with Indigenous consultants and stakeholder groups, which shows in the Hall: Indigenous history is intertwined with the history of Canada rather than being segregated. I\u2019m also proud of how we implemented multiple perspectives for complicated stories \u2014 and not just perspectives of Indigenous people in Canada and non-Indigenous Canadians; there are a lot of other voices here, too.\nFrom your very long career at the Museum, what are you most proud of? (With the exception, of course, of the new Hall.)\nI am proud of the fieldwork I did in the Arctic, and of the information that I was able to assemble from that. I am proud of having led the Archaeology and History Division for 10 years. I\u2019m also very happy to have written some books that were popular, especially one on the history of the Inuvialuit, the Inuit who live in the Western Arctic. When I talk to people from there, they know the book and look upon it with some pride, and consequently so do I.\nAs you were considering retirement, you were offered the challenge of developing this large exhibition on Canadian history. What made you accept?\nWell, I was thinking of retiring, but I didn\u2019t really want to retire, so this project was very welcome. Also, I knew I would be working with people I respect: Jean-Marc Blais, the Director General of the Museum, and Mark O\u2019Neill, the Museum\u2019s President and CEO. It was Mark who had the idea for the Hall in the first place. I was also particularly glad to work with the other project directors, Chantal Amyot and Lisa Leblanc.\nSo, the team was a big draw, and the project itself was a huge opportunity to leave a legacy at the Museum. It\u2019s very exciting that Canada is now at a place where we can produce a hall like this, and with very serious Indigenous buy-in. We\u2019ve been able to present things like the building of the [Canadian\u00a0Pacific] railroad not just as a great engineering feat that ties the country together, which is a story we\u2019re all very familiar with, but also as an event with a high human cost. This Hall will have enormous power in shaping Canada\u2019s perceptions of its past, and I believe we\u2019ve put forth a much more comprehensive view of that past.\nWhat will you miss most about this project when you retire?\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/carving-of-a-human-face/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Carving of a human face", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-07-04 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, S97-13698, IMG2013-0146-0008-Dm\nThis ivory carving made between 3,900 and 3,600 years ago is the oldest known depiction of a human face in Canada.

Of course, when you set out to present 15,000 years of history in 4,000 square metres (40,000 square feet), some challenges will undoubtedly arise. However, as Creative Development Specialist Nathalie Rheault recounts, it is often these challenges that inspire the most creative ideas.\nRheault and her team were working on\u00a0Gallery 1 \u2013 Early Canada, in which the story of New France is presented. They were especially intent on highlighting the role of women in the colony, which included the crucial role played by the filles du roi (daughters of the king).\nIn 1663, recognizing that the population of New France was overwhelmingly male, the French Crown sponsored some 800 young female emigrants who were encouraged to marry and start families in New France, which was disproportionately male. After the arrival of the filles du roi, the settler population rose dramatically, from about 3,200 in 1666 to about 70,000 a century later. These women were vital to the survival of the colony, and they have indeed earned a prominent place in the Canadian Museum of History\u2019s portrayal of New France.\nHowever, as historian Forrest Pass explains, there are no artifacts associated with these women. How, then, would the Museum represent them?\nThe team had an idea: \u201cWomen in New France were very fertile,\u201d said Rheault. \u201cThey had, on average, 11 children. An interesting way to communicate this fertility is through genealogy, to show these women have left a significant legacy in the form of their descendants. In fact, most French Canadians today are descendants of these women.\u201d\nPass points out that, thanks to the Catholic Church, we have unusually detailed baptism, marriage and death records for New France. The Museum engaged genealogist Marie Royal, who can trace her own roots back to a fille du roi, to research the history of a few women. \u201cShe was very helpful,\u201d said Pass. \u201cShe provided exhaustive research, and it was fascinating.\u201d But, again, how would the Museum display this research?\nAt this point, the team had to address the figurative elephant in the room \u2014 or, in this case, the enormous column that stands in the middle of Gallery 1. Of course, this column plays a crucial structural role, but it also presented a significant spatial challenge in organizing a display. The column was going to be a problem \u2014 or was it?\nAfter much thought, the team came up with an idea. Instead of working around the problematic column, why not incorporate it? They turned it into a family tree, thereby addressing two of their challenges in one shot: the presence of the column and the question of how to display the genealogical material.\nAs a subject of the family tree, they chose Catherine Moit\u00e9, one of the first filles du roi to arrive in Canada. \u201cHer genealogy is astounding,\u201d says Rheault. She had 11 children, 65 grandchildren and 344 great-grandchildren, all represented on the tree as either trunk, branches or leaves.\nMoit\u00e9, along with her fellow filles du roi, was central to the survival of New France, and so it is only appropriate that her legacy stands tall at the very centre of the Museum\u2019s presentation of New France. As for the column, it is no longer an obstacle, but arguably one of the Hall\u2019s most striking displays.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/king%e2%88%92byng-affair/", "category": "History in 150 Events", "title": "King\u2212Byng affair", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-06-22 00:00:00", "text": "Lord Byng of Vimy.

An Arctic expedition, comprising 128 men under the command of Sir John Franklin, departed in two ships from Britain in May 1845 with the task of fulfilling a 400-year-old dream \u2014 charting a Northwest Passage through the Arctic Archipelago from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.\nThe Expedition spent its first Arctic winter near Beechey Island, where three men died and were buried. Their bodies, autopsied in 1984 and 1986, preserved evidence of lead poisoning and tuberculosis, early signs that all was not well aboard the expedition\u2019s ships.\nWhat happened after Franklin\u2019s expedition left Beechey Island is still unclear. One expedition document, discovered near Victory Point on King William Island, reported the death of Sir John Franklin on June 11, 1847; desertion of the ice-beset ships on April 22, 1848; and the intention of the remaining 105 crewmen to walk to the mainland. None survived; their fate remembered by Inuit, who saw sick and starving men trekking south and later found their bodies, some bearing unmistakable evidence of cannibalism.\nThere is a widespread perception that the expedition was composed of nameless men, poorly equipped for land travel, who suffered and died in horrible circumstances. This is unfortunate because it obscures the fact that each crewmember was someone\u2019s husband, father, son, brother or uncle.\nSalt print of Lieutenant Fairholme\u2019s daguerreotype portrait.

Fairholme, like Fitzjames and the other Erebus officers, had his daguerreotype portrait taken before leaving Britain (consult Russell Potter\u2019s blog to learn more); 12 of these daguerreotypes survive at the Scott Polar Research Institute.\nIn researching those images, William Battersby recognized that some officers actually had a second portrait taken, a fact confirmed by Lieutenant Fairholme in a letter written to his father in May 1845:\n\u201cI hope Elizabeth [James\u2019 sister] got my photograph. Lady Franklin said she thought it made me look too old, but as I had Fitzjames\u2019 coat on at the time, to save myself the trouble of getting my own, you will perceive that I am a Commander! and have anchors on the epaulettes so it will do capitally when that really is the case.\u201d\nAlthough the original daguerreotype is now lost, the Fairholme family had a salt print made during the 19th century. This image, along with Lieutenant Fairholme\u2019s posthumously awarded Arctic Medal 1818-1855, was kept inside a small custom-made case with a silver dessert fork that Lieutenant Fairholme took aboard Erebus.\nDessert fork and Arctic Medal in a case.

The Canadian Museum of History is a proud member of this worldwide community. The theme this year, Museums and contested histories: Saying the unspeakable in museums, encourages museums to play an active role in peacefully addressing traumatic histories through mediation and multiple points of view.\nThis subject is especially relevant for us as we prepare for the July 1 opening of the Canadian History Hall, our new, signature exhibition. The Hall\u2019s mandate is to offer a comprehensive look at Canada\u2019s history, from the dawn of human habitation to the present day, which means telling this country\u2019s many stories, including difficult ones.\nAs Director of Creative Development and Learning for the Canadian History Hall, Lisa Leblanc determines the most effective ways of sharing the Museum\u2019s stories, research and collections with visitors. She admits that the new Hall\u2019s mandate is challenging.\nThe Hall presents 15,000 years of history within 40,000 square feet. And although it would obviously be impossible to explore every facet of Canada\u2019s history, it was important for the team that this country\u2019s story be told from as many perspectives as possible \u2014 a sentiment that was echoed across the country during consultations with advisory committees and the general public. The resounding message was that Canadians wanted more than one perspective on our history; specifically, they wanted to see both the good and the bad represented in the new Hall.\nInternational Museum Day 2017 poster, courtesy of ICOM\nTelling a complete story means looking at history from many angles, from perspectives of community and national pride to critical vantages. For example, as Leblanc points out, you can\u2019t tell the story of the transcontinental railroad without talking about the displacement of Indigenous peoples or the impact it had on Chinese workers.\nOnce Leblanc and the Canadian History Hall team had further determined what Canadians wanted to see, their job was to determine how to present those topics. For example, the new Hall will include a section on Indian residential schools: a horrific chapter in Canada\u2019s history that required careful handling. The Hall also addresses post-contact wars and disease, as well as struggles for acceptance and recognition, such as the continuing story of Canada\u2019s LGBTQ community and the recent arrival of Syrian refugees. As Leblanc notes, visitors arrive at the Museum with unique personal histories and varying degrees of comfort or tolerance for difficult subject matter. The team\u2019s challenge was to present these chapters in a manner that is sensitive to visitors without obscuring the history.\nFor one thing, the team made sure that presentations were honest, clear and open, but without being intentionally shocking or disturbing. As Leblanc explains, \u201cThere is always a sense of calibration. You don\u2019t want to be sensational, but you don\u2019t want to be reticent, either.\u201d Also important was providing visitors with places for quiet reflection \u2014 particularly around difficult material. These special areas will allow visitors to take a moment to collect their thoughts, or to gather and talk quietly after engaging with the material. With regard to disturbing video footage, advisories will be posted informing visitors of the type of content, allowing them to make their own viewing decisions.\nUltimately, Leblanc says, \u201cmuseums are keepers of evidence. We put the content out there for people to see in all its complexity, and we provide a safe place for people to have conversations about that evidence.\u201d In other words, it is the Museum\u2019s job to say, \u201cHere are the different voices, perspectives and experiences,\u201d then leave it up to visitors to consider that information. Her hope is that the material sparks conversation and new ways of considering the past.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/great-peace-of-montreal/", "category": "History in 150 Events", "title": "Great Peace of Montr\u00e9al", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-05-17 00:00:00", "text": "First Peoples signatures of Aboriginal chiefs, Great Peace of Montreal, 1701.

Now, over a century and a half later, we eagerly anticipate the arrival of an exhibition on this ill-fated voyage. We have been developing the exhibition since 2014, in partnership with Parks Canada and the National Maritime Museum in England, and in collaboration with the Government of Nunavut and the Inuit Heritage Trust.\nThe tale of the Franklin Expedition is a remarkable one, set against the dramatic backdrop of the Arctic, and it is as captivating, mysterious and tragic today as it was in 1845, when it all began. Many people know the story: Sir John Franklin led a British search for the final section of the Northwest Passage, which had been otherwise largely charted. As Creative Development Specialist Claire Champ explains, \u201cThey had only a small part of the Northwest Passage to chart. They were optimistic, they were well prepared, but \u2014 as we now know \u2014 they were heading for a particularly desolate location.\u201d No wonder this area was known to Inuit people as Tununiq or \u201cThe Back of Beyond.\u201d\nHMS Erebus in the Ice, 1846, Fran\u00e7ois \u00c9tienne Musin. \u00a9 National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London, Caird Collection, BHC3325\nNow, for the first time, an exhibition will bring together iconic artifacts and newly recovered objects from the Erebus to more fully present the story of the Franklin Expedition, including details about life on board the ships and the potential causes and circumstances of the crew\u2019s death. We are particularly excited about highlighting the crucial role Inuit people have played in informing the exhibition, through artifacts and recordings of oral histories. As Curator Karen Ryan explains, though parts of the expedition still remain a mystery, \u201cwithout Inuit knowledge, we wouldn\u2019t know nearly as much as we do.\u201d\nThe story of the Franklin Expedition is complex. It contains many chapters, perspectives and mysteries. It also belongs to more than one nation. It is a British story because the ships and crew members were British, but it is also central to Canada\u2019s identity as a northern nation. The story also belongs to Inuit people, who have preserved it in their oral histories for generations. Above all, it is a story with universal appeal, about an astonishing struggle for survival.\nFollowing a run in the United Kingdom that begins in July 2017, at the National Maritime Museum, the Franklin Expedition exhibition will cross the Atlantic to open at the Museum of History in March 2018.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/new-brunswicks-first-assembly-meets-at-mallard-house/", "category": "History in 150 Events", "title": "New Brunswick\u2019s first assembly meets at Mallard House", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-05-12 00:00:00", "text": "View of Province Hall and Public Offices, Fredericton New Brunswick.

The ritual of growing a playoff beard in the postseason is popularly believed to have begun with Denis Potvin, Clark Gillies and their teammates on the New York Islanders in the 1980s. Over time, this ritual has come to mark success in the post-season. The longer the beard, the deeper the run of player and team. Some fans have adopted this ritual to show their support for a team, and to participate vicariously in the playoffs.\nMany other signature NHL playoff rituals are driven by fans. As early as the 1950s, newspapers reported that hockey fans threw items on the ice to intimidate opposing teams, or to protest a referee\u2019s call. In 1955, fans threw shoes and galoshes on the ice during a Canadiens game in Montr\u00e9al to protest NHL President Clarence Campbell\u2019s recent decision to suspend Maurice Richard for the rest of the NHL season. A riot erupted outside the Montr\u00e9al Forum, where Campbell attended the game. Visitors to the Hockey exhibition can see a can of \u201cRocket\u201d Richard soup created to protest Campbell\u2019s decision.\nOne of the most curious (and gross) examples of fans throwing items comes from Detroit, where fans are known to throw octopuses on the ice. The original octopus-pitcher was Jerry Cusimano. In 1952, Jerry and his brother Pete hoped that Detroit would win the 1952 Stanley Cup in eight consecutive games in the final two series. The team had swept the semi-finals, and were ahead of Montr\u00e9al in the finals. Jerry came up with the idea of throwing an octopus on the ice for good luck. Eight legs, eight wins in a row.\nLegendary sports reporters Dick Beddoes and Scott Young reported on the octopus-pitchers for the Toronto Globe and Mail in the 1960s and 1970s. They learned that Cusimano got the octopus from the family seafood business, snuck it into the Detroit Olympia arena for Games 3 and 4, and flung it onto the ice. As you can imagine, the on-ice officials were not impressed. The Wings won the eight consecutive games, however, and the Cup. In a 1961 interview, Cusimano revealed that he carried the octopus to the games in bagpipes. Originally, the octopuses were brought to games in a bowling bag, but Cusimano once grabbed the wrong bag on his way to the arena. Successfully in, his technique was to wait for an exciting movement, then pitch the octopus onto the ice.\nCusimano delighted in this ritual. He told a reporter: \u201cThey never notice when I unzip the thing, slip out the octopus, rear back, and SPLAT! There she is at centre ice, with all the players poking at it as if it\u2019s going to explode.\u201d After Jerry died in a car accident, Pete took over the tradition. Pete described the best technique to Beddoes: \u201cYou grip the thing in the palm of your hand. You pick out your target. Then you rear back and heave it like you would a hand grenade. You got to keep your elbow stiff to get the best distance.\u201d Pete Cusimano told Beddoes that he and his brother boiled the octopus beforehand to turn it bright red, but recent images and memorabilia show purple octopuses.\nJohn Finley, former team doctor for the Detroit Red Wings, kept this Viceroy Rubber puck from the 1995 playoffs. The team did not \u201cbring back the cup\u201d that year, losing to the New Jersey Devils in the Stanley Cup Finals. Photo: Canadian Museum of History.\nIn the 1990s, Al Sobotka \u2014 building manager and ice keeper of Joe Louis Arena \u2014 began twirling the octopuses overhead as he fetched them from the ice. The Red Wings played their last game at Joe Louis Arena in April, but Sobotka recently told the Detroit Free Press that his ritual would continue. Over the years, the octopus became a symbol on Detroit Red Wings merchandise \u2014 like this puck from the 1995 playoffs \u2014 and a mascot for the team.\nWith so many stories to tell about the game, we had to make difficult choices and were not able to feature that particular puck in the Hockey exhibition. You can, however, see objects related to a notorious Canadian ritual inspired by Roger Neilson, a coach known for being an innovator. In a 1982 Stanley Cup semi-final, the Blackhawks beat the Canucks 4\u20131 in Chicago in a chippy match marked by fighting, both on and off the ice. Near the end of the game, Neilson, the Canucks head coach, put a trainer\u2019s white towel on a hockey stick and waved it to protest what he believed was poor officiating. Some Canucks players did likewise. As a result, Neilson was ejected from the game, but Canucks fans loved his defiant act, bringing their own towels to waive at the next game, in Vancouver. Waving white towels during Canucks playoff home games is now a form of cheering, known as \u201cTowel Power.\u201d\nCoach Roger Neilson was known for his innovations, and also for his wild neckties. This bobble-head doll shows \u201cRog,\u201d with towel, and a colourful example. Doll on loan from the Peterborough & District Sports Hall of Fame. Photo: Canadian Museum of History.\nIn 1982, a Globe and Mail reporter described Nielson\u2019s actions as embarrassing. He argued that the American press did not take the NHL seriously, and Nielson\u2019s towel antics reinforced the idea that hockey wasn\u2019t a big-league sport. The writer advised that: \u201cThe best thing would be for Neilson to issue an official public apology, and for everyone involved to forget about it.\u201d\nBut Neilson\u2019s act proved popular. In 2002, to mark Neilson\u2019s 1,000th game in the NHL, the Ottawa Senators distributed white towels to attending fans, who are a big part of hockey history and culture. In fact, an entire section of the Hockey exhibition is devoted to fans, as they are an essential part of the game. You can see Neilson\u2019s commemorative towel, as well as handmade items and memorabilia belonging to super-fans.\nRoger Neilson inspired Vancouver\u2019s towel-waving ritual. Neilson finished his career as assistant coach of the Ottawa Senators. The team made him interim head coach for the final two games of the 2002 NHL season, so he could reach the 1,000-game mark as a head coach. They issued these towels to mark the occasion. Neilson died in 2003. Towel on loan from the Peterborough & District Sports Hall of Fame.

At the same time, we didn\u2019t want to present visitors with photographs they\u2019d seen thousands of times before. The unique and innovative character of a photograph was also part of our selection process, as was the fact that the selection of photographs had to reflect the diversity of Canadian history in its geographical, ethnocultural, social and gender aspects. Let\u2019s just say that the process was almost as mind-bending as trying to probe the mysteries of squaring a circle!\nIt was somewhat tricky to address so many considerations with a limited number of pictures. In concrete terms it meant, for example, that some photographs did not have a strong enough impact to be chosen, even though they recalled important events. In other cases, replacing one photograph with another strongly compromised the exhibition\u2019s geographical balance.\nDonovan Bailey wins the gold medal for the men\u2019s 100 metres at the 1996 Olympics\nDoug Mills, Atlanta, Georgia, July 27, 1996. Associated Press and The Canadian Press, 96072701569\nAnother major challenge involved shortening the texts, all of which had been written by well-known authors. Sometimes the texts were as long as 800 words, and our task was to condense them into intelligible and interesting blocks of no more than 125 words, while also retaining the individual style of each author. I have never given the word-count calculator such a workout.\nDespite all this, I am firmly convinced that the exhibition will appeal to a broad range of visitors. Snapshots of Canada will provide an impressionistic, and often extraordinary portrait of moments both happy and dramatic in our history. The authors and their texts will also help Canadians explore \u2014 sometimes in a confident tone, sometimes more poignantly \u2014 the lives of the famous, and less famous, men and women who built this country.\nFeminist Jackie Henderson at a rally.

It was originally known as the African Village. Over time, a large Black community developed, with its own Baptist church, stores and farms. While the city collected taxes, it did not provide any services. It was zoned as industrial, and had slaughterhouses, waste plants, a prison, a railway and an infectious diseases hospital. This area was, however, culturally significant for its residents, who saw it as an oasis from racism. Starting in the late 1940s, Halifax began talking about removing the \u201cslum\u201d and redeveloping the area. The plan was finally initiated in 1964. Expropriation was quick and many found that their homes were destroyed without warning or process. The church was razed in 1967. The community was displaced, poorly compensated and set adrift.

One commonly collected item is the jersey. These are often worn or hung in pride of place in the homes of true fans. Jerseys, however, can present some unique challenges with regard to longevity, when framed in a typical commercial manner.\nThe primary role of conservation is to ensure that artifacts remain in a condition that keeps them accessible to future generations. Commercial framing may or may not have these same goals. So, when a commercially framed jersey arrived in the conservation labs here at the Canadian Museum of History for display in the Hockey\u00a0exhibition, steps were taken to ensure that it would remain in as good a condition as possible.\nThe visual appearance of a jersey is often the deciding factor in a commercial framing project. This means that all kinds of things may be used to display the jersey \u201cjust so.\u201d Screws, nails, staple, straight and safety pins, plastic-price-tagging guns, double-sided tape, etc. are just some of the possible materials we have seen used.\nThe commercial framing of this Wayne Gretzky jersey was altered to make use of more conservation friendly methods and materials, while retaining the original look. Photo: Canadian Museum of History.\nIn the Museum\u2019s conservation labs, we wanted to achieve the same look while using more conservation-appropriate methods and materials. When we received the framed work, the body and arms of the jersey had been lined with paper-faced foam board (Fome-Cor\u00ae) to help provide shape; these were switched out for acid-free archival quality 4-ply matboard. The shapes of the new matboard forms were also refined to better fill out and support the shoulders of the jersey.\nThe double-sided tape affixing the hem of the jersey to the backboard was removed as well. Small nails and pins were taken out of the hem, the wrists and the sleeves. The jersey had been mounted with a single screw through the original Fome-Cor in the open area of the v-neck; this attachment method was retained in the new mounting. Because the back of the jersey was what people would see, the v-neck mount would not show.\nThe padded Plexiglas support was riveted to the secondary Plexiglas piece and to the backboard. Photo: Canadian Museum of History.\nAdditionally, a sheet of polyester \u2014 a thin, relatively stable plastic film \u2014 was placed behind the jersey to separate it from the original, potentially acidic, backboard. The arms of the jersey were then pinned in place with a couple of very fine straight pins, and a couple of stitches were placed in the hems of the arms to ensure that the matboard inserts would not slip out of place.\nFor our Hockey exhibition, we were also asked to imitate the commercial framing style with a Carey Price game-worn jersey from our collection. In this particular case, it was the front of the jersey that the curators wanted to show.\nPaper patterns were created by tracing the shapes of the arms and body of the jersey. These were then used to make the matboard inserts that help to support the jersey and provide the desired shape. Photo: Canadian Museum of History.\nThis presented a challenge in terms of mounting the jersey, as the hanging hardware would show if we used the open v-neck space. Together with staff from the exhibition preparation team, a plan was devised to build a lightly padded hanger of acrylic sheet (Plexiglas\u00ae). This would fit into the shoulders of the jersey, then be attached to a second, thicker piece of Plexiglas and to the backboard with metal rivets. This thicker piece of Plexiglas provides the necessary gap between the backboard and the jersey, to keep the jersey from being squished when attached to the board.\nThe same methods we had used in altering the original commercially framed jersey were repeated here \u2014 using archival quality matboard inserts, straight pins and a few stitches \u2014 all to mimic the look of the jerseys hanging on walls across the country and around the world.\nThe finished, faux-commercially framed Carey Price Jersey.

As Dias argues, \u201cIt is a physical object that gets you to think and reflect.\u201d\nAnd are you wondering what the heavy sweater feels like to wear?

It\u2019s hard to remain indifferent when faced with the sheer size and beauty of this monumental work \u2014 a work, it should be noted, that is about 15 metres tall, or four storeys high! The painting fascinates me for its artistic style, which includes hints of Cubism (in my opinion, at least), as well as for its rich imagery. With numerous elements, patterns and motifs that evoke so many typically Canadian symbols, it tells the story of this country, in its own way.\nThe story of the work itself is also somewhat affecting. It is hard to imagine, but its very survival was in jeopardy when the Montr\u00e9al building where it originally hung in the lobby changed hands. Fortunately, the building\u2019s corporate owners donated the work to the Museum, ensuring it a permanent home. That is how it came to be installed in the Nishga Girl Salon.

Construction is almost complete, and we are in the process of installing the artifacts that will tell Canada\u2019s story. For the last three years, our conservators have been working to prepare the collections for display in the new Hall.\nOne of the artifacts chosen for inclusion in the Hall is a wooden model of a cradleboard, built around 1860 in an Anishinabe style and motif. It will be displayed in Gallery 2, which covers the period from 1763 to 1914, a time of struggle and perseverance for Indigenous Peoples in Canada. As curator Forrest Pass explains, this cradleboard \u2014 with its association with birth \u2014 tells a story of resilience, persistence and renewal in the difficult time of colonization.\nBy the time an object like this cradleboard is ready to be displayed, it has passed through many hands, including the careful hands of the Museum\u2019s conservators. But their role in the object\u2019s story often goes unnoticed \u2014 because that\u2019s their goal. Conservators work closely with curators to make sure their work does not interfere with understanding the history of the artifact.\nCradleboard before and after treatment. Photo: Canadian Museum of History.\nWhen treating an artifact, as textile conservator Caterina Florio explains, \u201cThe first objective is to stabilize the materials. The aim is to slow down the rate of deterioration and to prevent further damage, not to make the object look like new. You never want to hide the fact that an object has been used and handed down through time.\u2019\u2019 Objects conservator Emily Lin adds, \u201cWe don\u2019t want treatment to alter the intention or interpretation of the object.\u201d\nThe artifact is photographed and examined to document its condition before beginning a treatment. Next, treatment options are discussed with the curator and tests are done to help understand as much as possible about the artifact. The conservation treatment on the cradleboard required collaboration between two experts because it is made of different materials.\nObjects conservator, Emily Lin was concerned about cracks in the wooden board and loose glass beads. After securing the thread to prevent further bead loss, she cleaned the beads \u2014 very gently \u2014 with water and cotton swabs. She secured a crack in the wooden board with an appropriate adhesive, and then she removed loose dust and dirt from the board. Instead of vacuuming the surface directly, she used a small paintbrush to brush the dust into the vacuum nozzle, after fitting the nozzle with a screen in case any of the beads came loose. In keeping with the minimal intervention approach, no beads were added. Lin\u2019s part of the treatment was complete.\nDetail of ribbon trim before and after treatment. Photo: Canadian Museum of History.\nNext, it was textile conservator Florio\u2019s turn. One of her main concerns was the frayed, damaged ribbon trim on the top edge of the artifact. To stabilize this area, she applied nylon netting over the ribbon trim using a few strategically placed stitches to hold the fragile, loose threads in place. This approach consolidates the ribbon and gives the artifact a more uniform look. Again, she had no intention of hiding the current damage, only to stabilize the ribbon. Florio also carried out surface cleaning of the fabric since dust accumulation dries out fibres, making them brittle and more vulnerable to further damage.\nFinally, a custom-made support was placed inside the textile component to prevent sagging and creases, which can lead to weakening of the fibres.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/agnes-deans-cameron-travels-to-the-arctic-ocean/", "category": "History in 150 Events", "title": "Agnes Deans Cameron travels to the Arctic Ocean", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "Agnes Deans Cameron, about 1911.

Wintemberg, an archaeologist with the National Museum of Canada (today the Canadian Museum of History), excavated a site near Prescott, Ontario, which he named \u201cRoebuck\u201d after a nearby hamlet. The people who had once lived at the site were related to the Iroquoian language-speakers met and described by Jacques Cartier at Stadacona (today\u2019s Qu\u00e9bec City) and Hochelaga (today\u2019s Montr\u00e9al). But was the Roebuck site earlier or later than Cartier? And what can the site tell us about communities that had vanished by the time Samuel de Champlain sailed up the same river, less than a century later, to establish a permanent French settlement at the former site of Stadacona?\nDuring the 1912 excavations, Wintemberg\u2019s team found a piece of \u201ccarved bone,\u201d which, Wintemburg noted in the catalogue, looked \u201csuspiciously European.\u201d It lay quietly in the Museum\u2019s collection for more than a century. At one point, visiting researcher William Fox also noted this unique specimen, and mentioned it to me. His observation was filed away.\nDevelopment of the new Canadian History Hall required a new look at this country\u2019s history. This process also required a thorough review of Canadian Museum of History collections for items that could be used to illustrate a new understanding of Canada\u2019s past.\nI was tasked with recounting initial contacts between Europeans and the First Peoples of Canada beginning with the Norse, and ending with Champlain\u2019s establishment of Qu\u00e9bec City in 1608. The \u201csuspiciously European\u201d bone item found at the Roebuck site soon came to mind. What was it? Was it clearly associated with the Indigenous occupation of the site? How old might it be?\nThe following account demonstrates, once again, the importance of preserving evidence of the past, and of making it available to new analytical techniques and new questions.\nModern aerial photograph of the Roebuck site. The bone needle case was found to the right of the photograph\u2019s centre. Image: Google Maps.\nThe piece is made of bone measuring nearly 1 centimetre in thickness. It has clearly been turned on a lathe. In addition to featuring circular marks and perfect symmetry around a central axis, it has a pivot point at the blunt tip, and four sharp triangular indentations left by the chuck that held the piece in place while it spun.\nI shared photographs with colleagues and friends, as well as with specialists I had never met. Several reasonable suggestions were made regarding its purpose, including a lace bodkin and a tuning peg for a stringed instrument. The best fit, however, was that it was a needle case: a container shaped on a lathe from a thick piece of bone, to store valuable metal sewing needles. The case would also have had a stopper attached to a deep groove just below the opening.\nBut why was this object left at this ancient Indigenous site? The needle case could have been left by people who established a farmstead on the former Indigenous site, centuries after its original occupants had left. Wintemberg, however, had indicated that the needle case was part of the Indigenous deposits he excavated, and thus not part of material left there in the 19th or 20th centuries.\nSo, how old is the needle case? Carley Crann of the A.E. Lalonde AMS Laboratory at the University of Ottawa was approached to help answer this fundamental question. Guiding the sampling process was the fact that the piece has great display value, and as such, any sampling had to be discreet and not change its appearance.\nCarley Crann (A.E. Lalonde AMS Laboratory \u2014 University of Ottawa) carefully samples material from the inside cavity of the Roebuck site needle case to directly radiocarbon-date the artifact. Photo: Canadian Museum of History.\nCrann decided to use a tiny drill bit to scrape away fine particles from the interior. The resulting sample of powdered bone was then subjected to a complex treatment and preparation procedure to purify it. This process also reduced the potential for error or contamination. The sample was now ready to be subjected to nuclear physics and be dated with an accelerator and a mass spectrometer, which literally counted the amount of radioactive carbon remaining since the death of the animal from which the bone had come.\nThe results indicated that the needle case is made of bone from an animal that died 237\u00b169 years ago. Applying some statistical comparisons between this raw result and known radiocarbon curves, the likelihood is quite high that the needle case dates from between 1479 and 1707.\nThat\u2019s a pretty big window of time, but further refinements were made by Jennifer Birch, who had recently dated samples of Indigenous corn kernels from Roebuck, as well as from similar sites before and after Roebuck in the Upper St. Lawrence Valley. This highly sophisticated analysis allowed narrowing of the needle case\u2019s dates to 1520\u20131560 (good probability) or 1499\u20131578 (highest probability).\nThese are still broad chronological timeframes, and remain statistical statements of probability. At the same time, however, they strongly indicate that the needle case was acquired by occupants of the Roebuck site well before Champlain had ever seen the St. Lawrence Valley \u2014 at a time when the vast and seemingly endless stocks of fish and whales along Canada\u2019s East Coast were attracting large seasonal fishing and whaling fleets from Europe.\nThis was a time when two very different worlds were learning about one another. Contact was sometimes direct, as during Jacques Cartier\u2019s three expeditions (1534, 1535 and 1543), and sometimes indirect, as when Indigenous Peoples visited seasonally abandoned European whaling stations or camps.\nThe Roebuck bone needle case with close-up views of the opening, showing triangular chuck marks and lathe marks on the neck of the case. Photo: Canadian Museum of History.\nWe can only wonder what stories reached distant inland communities such as Roebuck about strangers along the shores of the St. Lawrence River and the East Coast. There were certainly accounts of clashes and conflicts, just as there may have been tales of great boats and thundering weapons.\nWas the needle case offered to a local hunter by a fisherman who had come ashore to replenish his ship\u2019s freshwater supply? What was offered in exchange? And through how many hands did the needle case pass before being dropped at the Roebuck site?\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/canadian-labour-union-is-founded/", "category": "History in 150 Events", "title": "Canadian Labour Union is founded", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "text": "Vice-President of the Canadian Labour Union, Daniel J.

The lyrics to \u201cI\u2019m on My Way to Canada\u201d were chosen to help tell Canada\u2019s story. But first, the document needed to be stabilized for display.\nThe main conservation goal was to stabilize the sheet\u2019s splits, resulting from years of being folded in eighths. Gelatin and Japanese tissue were applied along the central, vertical crease where the paper was split.\nThe song is written on a single sheet of paper \u2014 not a large artifact, but when paper conservator Amanda Gould took a closer look, she discovered that it presented some significant challenges. Namely, having been folded in eighths for quite some time, the paper had split along its creases. Gould\u2019s main goal was to stabilize those splits.\nFirst, she had to consider what types of media were present on the artifact. In addition to the actual lyrics, the paper contained some doodles. A man\u2019s face with a goatee, for example, can be seen on the back. These doodles were drawn in different kinds of ink, which tests identified as being water soluble. This meant that the conventional process of repairing tears with Japanese tissue and wheat starch paste had to be ruled out because it involved too much water.\nSplits along the creases were stabilized as a result of the treatment. Though these images do not show a dramatic visible difference between before and after, the conservation done on the paper sheet will better preserve it for the future and will allow this authentic artifact to be displayed in the Canadian History Hall. Here, we see the front of the sheet.\nAlso complicating the process was the presence of iron gall ink. Widely used throughout history, this ink is a widespread conservation problem. Iron gall ink was made at home, mixed by individuals in a variety of ways, using a variety of ingredients. One ingredient, however, was always present: iron(II) sulfate. And it is iron(II) that poses the problem now, mainly because \u2014 simply put \u2014 it can be corrosive.\nLuckily, conservators the world over have been working on solutions. Unfortunately for Gould, however, the most common application of these solutions uses water. She found herself in a Catch-22. She could not solve the problem of iron gall ink without destroying the doodles on the back of the document.\nSplits along the creases were stabilized as a result of the treatment. Though these images do not show a dramatic visible difference between before and after, the conservation done on the paper sheet will better preserve it for the future and will allow this authentic artifact to be displayed in the Canadian History Hall. This image shows the back of the sheet.\nGould knew that if she wasn\u2019t able to figure out how to stabilize it safely, the artifact would not be eligible for display.

Organizers of the tournament initially struggled to sell tickets. As a publicity stunt, the tournament committee decided to have Team Canada wear pink jerseys and white satin hockey pants.\nMany female players and organizers were angry. They felt that pink uniforms trivialized the athleticism of the new national women\u2019s team. The controversial decision paid off, however, in publicity and ticket sales. Team Canada won gold at the tournament, and the pink jerseys were retired.\nThe pink jerseys were not the first time a women\u2019s hockey uniform had been controversial. In 1938, members of the Preston Rivulettes were forbidden to wear their jerseys in the national women\u2019s championships, because the jerseys bore the name of the team\u2019s sponsor: the Preston Springs Hotel. The team had agreed to add \u201cSprings\u201d to their jerseys, in exchange for money to buy new equipment.\nThe problem was that sponsorship was prohibited by the Dominion Women\u2019s Amateur Hockey Association, sponsor of the tournament. Taking any kind of sponsorship or money was regarded by the public with suspicion, and players were expected to play simply for the love of the game. Members of the Rivulettes certainly loved hockey, but they also needed help to pay for new equipment.\nSuch financial support was badly needed during the Great Depression. Due to the restriction on sponsorship, in the end Rivulettes players wore the \u201cSprings\u201d jerseys during the regular season, but borrowed other jerseys for the championship tournament. In spite of the controversy, they took home the Lady Bessborough Trophy in 1938: a prize awarded to the best women\u2019s hockey team in Canada during that era.\nHockey uniform and skates that belonged to Hilda Ranscombe, star player with the Preston Rivulettes. Canadian Museum of History, IMG 2016 0253 0021-DM\nAcquired by the Canadian Museum of History in 2015, this hockey uniform and skates belonged to Hilda Ranscombe, star player with the Rivulettes. These iconic objects will be displayed for the first time in the Hockey exhibition, presented at the Museum from March 10 to October 9, 2017. The acquisition includes a wool jersey and socks, as well as canvas shorts that buckle at the waist.\nRanscombe and friends from her baseball team put the Rivulettes together because they wanted to play a winter sport. Hockey was an obvious choice in their hometown, where there were plenty of outdoor rinks, as well as an indoor arena. The young women were given money from a local Member of Parliament to hire a coach and enter their team in the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association.\nDr. Carly Adams\u2019 Queens of the Ice tells the story of the Rivulettes, who dominated Canadian women\u2019s hockey from 1933 to 1940. They reached the national finals every year and won four championships. Thousands of fans paid to see the Rivulettes and other women\u2019s teams play hockey in the 1930s. Local and national newspapers covered the women\u2019s teams. Victories were publicly celebrated, and players became local celebrities.\nThe Rivulettes\u2019 play was described as \u201cscrappy\u201d in newspaper reports of the time. Female players did not treat each other delicately \u2014 they even exchanged punches \u2014 and their aggressive play raised eyebrows. Sometimes reporters criticized the Rivulettes for playing \u201clike men.\u201d\nCommentators also described female players as \u201csweet,\u201d and implied that hockey was too rough on women. But women wanted to play, and they persisted. Most members of the Rivulettes worked in factories during the day and practiced after work and on weekends. Female teams did not get priority ice time, so they had to practice when space was available.\nHilda Ranscombe circa 1933, City of Cambridge Archives, Family of Hilda Ranscombe\nFollowing their 1930s heyday, women\u2019s hockey leagues all but disappeared during the Second World War. Teams were formed during the 1940s and 1950s, but there were few tournaments and no leagues for women again until the 1970s. Since 1990, however, registration in girls and women\u2019s hockey has increased tenfold.\nThe aggressive play, fan support and overall popularity of teams like the Rivulettes deepen our understanding of women\u2019s hockey history. One thing is certain: hockey is not new to women. Ranscombe\u2019s jersey and skates remind us that hockey is an intrinsic part of Canadian society. Who gets to play, what is controversial and what is acceptable have significantly changed over time, and will continue to evolve.\nThe story of the Preston Rivulettes is just one of the many fascinating aspects of Canada\u2019s national winter sport explored in Hockey, opening at the Museum of History on March 10.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/upper-canada-passes-british-empires-first-legislation-against-slavery/", "category": "History in 150 Events", "title": "Upper Canada passes British Empire\u2019s first legislation against slavery", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-02-22 00:00:00", "text": "An Act to Prevent the further Introduction of Slaves and to limit the Term of Contracts for Servitude, Statutes of Upper Canada, 33 George III, Cap. 7, 1793.

Canadian Museum of History, photo: Matthew Betts\nWhen the public thinks of archaeology, they often think of a stereotypical dig site: an archaeologist with a large crew, carefully removing dirt from precisely laid-out excavation units. Fieldwork involves hard manual labour, but the moments of discovery, the camaraderie of the crew, the outdoor setting and our collaborations with local communities more than make up for the long days.\nYet fieldwork is only a small portion of the archaeological process. In reality, about 90 percent of archaeology takes place in the laboratory and office, far from the excitement of any dig site.\nThe E\u2019se\u2019get Archaeology Project is a large Canadian Museum of History \u00a0research endeavour focused on defining the archaeological history of Nova Scotia\u2019s South Shore and, in particular, Port Joli Harbour.

E\u2019se\u2019get is a Mi\u2019kmaw word meaning \u201cto dig for clams.\u201d\nShell middens are archaeological deposits composed of clam shells and other discarded debris from everyday life. The shells leach calcium carbonate over time, neutralizing Nova Scotia\u2019s acidic soil, resulting in excellent preservation of artifacts and animal bones. Some of the shell middens here are over 100 centimetres deep, and are some of the largest intact shell middens in the Atlantic Provinces.\nClay-lined spark holders recovered during excavations in 2010.

Canadian Museum of History, Photo: Matthew Betts\nThe E\u2019se\u2019get Project began in 2008 and 2009, with walking surveys and limited test excavation. The most promising sites were subjected to major excavations in 2010 and again in 2012. As documented in our fieldwork blog, we discovered marvelous things, such as large processing middens (middens resulting from communal clam processing and draying), intact wigwam floors, previously unrecorded artifact types and the first sweat lodge ever excavated in the Atlantic Provinces. We also recovered over 22,000 artifacts, tens of thousands of animal remains and hundreds of soil samples.\nAfter four seasons of fieldwork, that harder task of describing, counting and identifying the remains \u2014 and ultimately making sense of their frequencies and distribution \u2014 had to begin. It can take a year of study in the lab, and sometimes many more, for every season of fieldwork. By my estimation, the amount of material would take up to 5 years.\nOur 2010 field crew composed of University of New Brunswick students, Acadia Frist Nation students and representatives from the Mi\u2019kmaw Rights Initiative.

These included measuring, describing and classifying the stone tools, a high-resolution descriptive study of the ceramic sherds (pottery), sorting and weighing the soil and shell samples and identifying the animal remains recovered.\nAfter 4 years, analysis of the Port Joli collection is nearly complete. Last week, the artifacts were transferred to the Nova Scotia Museum, where they will be permanently stored. A major paper on the animal bones from the site is about to be published, and we have published numerous others on the wigwam architecture, the sweat lodge, the shellfish from the site and aspects of Mi\u2019kmaw relationships with sharks.

The book will describe all the information we collected, along with the basic inferences we drew from it. It will leave a legacy of data for other archaeologists to consult and, eventually, to reinterpret from a fresh perspective.\nThis year, with the permission of the Acadia First Nation, I will begin a new project on Nova Scotia\u2019s South Shore. Coastal erosion caused by climate change is ravaging the archaeological deposits in the Maritimes and destroying Mi\u2019kmaw archaeological history along with it. With our Indigenous partners, and the help of local residents, we hope to find the most endangered sites and begin the process of salvaging and learning from them.\nArtifacts and animal bones being packed by Meagan Barnhart for shipping to the Nova Scotia Museum, January 2017.

The Haudenosaunee sought to regain their losses, and assuage their grief, through what was known as a mourning war, where war captives were either adopted or put to death through torture. Between 1642 and 1646, the Haudenosaunee attacked numerous Huron\u2013Wendat villages, as well as those of allied groups, including the Anishinabe of the Ottawa valley.

We live through time. Each and every stage of our lives is marked by it. It creeps into our daily routines, bringing reminders of the turn of the seasons. We live through it, but are also aware of it as a more impersonal gauge of the days, months and years.\nWe remind our children that in the old days, such as the 1960s or the 1990s, things were done differently. Time as decade, or century, is an abstraction which our progeny can more or less comprehend; so we keep reminding them. The generation that walks city streets and sidewalks today, noses pressed to cellphones, can easily find the time by looking at their devices.\nAnd yet there is nothing new here. This fixation with handheld devices has been with us for at least a century or more. Men and women have for years been turning their arms to glance at their watches to check the time. Before that, they might have reached for a pocket watch: tucked into the vest for a man; fixed to a chain worn around the neck for a woman.\nThere is one timepiece in the Museum\u2019s collection that tells an interesting story about how time has evolved. It is a watch worn by a passenger or member of the crew aboard the Empress of Ireland, on the night the ship went down in the Lower St. Lawrence: May 29, 1914.\nThere is no doubt that many other watches were worn by people on the Empress. But this one is intriguing, because it offers so few clues about its past history. You can\u2019t see the time: the dial face is no more. You can try to peek inside at some of the gears and levers through an aperture, but you really can\u2019t see much.\nWe have not (yet) taken the watch apart, as the Smithsonian did in 2009 with Abraham Lincoln\u2019s watch. \u00a0Were we to do so, we would find the miniscule gears and inner workings that make it run. These are partially visible in the micrograph and x-ray images that we did take in our effort to better understand the material aspects of the watch. But the x-ray images showed nothing that was particularly conclusive: the thicker and denser metal parts appeared lighter; the thin metal parts appeared darker.\nOn the exterior, under the cover, certain markings visible to the naked eye, and machine-etched into the metal, allow us to identify the maker: Robert Ingersoll Bros, New York. Accompanying this are two series of patent-date strings, arranged in concentric circles. The outer and more recent circle provides these dates: June 29 (19)09, May 24, (19)10, Nov 12 (19)12; the inner rings stretch from January 1901 to June 1907.\nThe most recent of the dates, November 1912, suggests that the watch had been in the possession of its owner less than 2 years prior to the sinking of the Empress. The movement serial number, also etched into the metal, is 3212177, which \u2014 according to one online table of Ingersoll Watch Company serial numbers \u2014 suggests that the Empress watch may have been manufactured in 1911, although the patent dates suggest otherwise.\nMore revealing of the watch\u2019s history is the interior label which, after conservation treatment, proved the identity of the item as a Yankee Dollar watch. However, this wasn\u2019t immediately apparent. Instead, it was discovered once the paper conservator started piecing the fragmented label back together.\nThe largest label fragment is shown on the left side of picture, before treatment. This fragment was originally set inside the lid, which covers the reverse side of the watch.\nPrior to treatment, the label consisted of one larger fragment, found loose within the lid of the watch, along with numerous smaller fragments \u2014 including one reading \u201cTHIS\u201d that had remained adhered to the interior of the lid. The size of the largest fragment suggested that approximately half of the label was missing, its original size having corresponded to the interior dimensions of the lid. The largest fragment had many small tears and folds, and the paper surface was so abraded in some areas that it looked like a mat of fibres.\nMost of the smaller fragments were found inside the mechanism cavity of the watch. The label is likely made of wove paper; however, the original colour, thickness and texture of the paper remain difficult to determine, as more than 90 percent of the paper\u2019s surface is orange in colour, due to staining associated with corrosion of the watch components. Although not made primarily of iron, the watch contains iron screws and rivets.\nBefore treatment, the largest label fragment read:\nGUAR_/TO KEEP GOO_/YEAR AND IF_/___TO DO_S/BY US FREE_/OPTION FOR_/WRAP CAREFU_/RETURN POST_/YOUR NAME_/LID ONLY/______SIGNED BY/DEALER WHEN SOLD/DEALER SIGN NAME HERE [________]/ROBTH_/315_AVE., NE/AFTER FIRST YE_/IF WATCH NEEDS REPAIR_/IT TO US AND WE WILL I_/YOU WHAT REPA_/WILL COST/ WAT______AND DATE IS/\nDuring treatment, certain key fragments were found \u2014 one on line 1, which adds the following to the label text:\nTHIS/ YAN /GUAR_/TO KEEP GOO_/YEAR AND IF_/___TO DO_S/BY US FREE_/OPTION\nDuring treatment, all of the recovered fragments, most of which were retrieved from the cavity of the watch, were adhered, one by one, to Japanese paper (white in this image). Japanese paper is frequently used for this kind of work, because it is strong but will not damage fragile paper fragments.\nThe \u201cYAN\u201d identifies this as a Yankee Dollar watch. Our work also made the inscription on line 3 more visible, where it refers to Robert Ingersoll and Brothers, the watch manufacturer:\nWHEN SOLD/DEALER SIGN NAME HERE [________]/ROBT.H.INGERSOLL/BRO/MA/315_AVE.,\nAfter treatment the paper, mounted on Japanese tissue, was placed onto a layer of polyester film, then reinserted into the inside of the watch lid.\nA gifted salesman-cum-entrepreneur, Robert Ingersoll began selling inexpensive pocket watches at the 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Within a couple of years, he was selling hundreds of thousands of Yankee Dollar watches made for him by the Waterbury Clock Company, a firm based in central Connecticut \u2014 a city with a significant population of French Canadians. Dollar watches were sold in Europe and elsewhere in North America, including Canada. By 1903, the company had an office in Montr\u00e9al, Canada\u2019s largest city.\nAlthough, owing to the success of the company, there are many examples of Ingersoll \u201cdollar\u201d watches and watch labels in existence, only one in the Canadian Museum of History\u2019s collection is associated with the wreck of the Empress of Ireland. There were other watches found on victims of the disaster; newspapers reports mention at least four. However, given the widespread nature of watch ownership at the turn of the century, this is probably a gross underestimate of the total number aboard.\nA page from the Ingersoll Brothers catalogue, advertising the Yankee Dollar watch. The image shows a label on which Ingersoll\u2019s iron-clad guarantee appears. Ingersoll was deliberately aiming at the mass-market. The advertisement reads thus: \u201cWe style ourselves \u2018watchmakers to the American people\u2019 because we make watches of guaranteed quality which the MASSES can afford to buy.\u201d\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/klondikers-2/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Klondikers", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-02-08 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Larss & Duclos, J6177-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/banting-and-best-discover-insulin/", "category": "History in 150 Events", "title": "Banting and Best discover insulin", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-02-08 00:00:00", "text": "\nC.H.

Used with permission.\nEvery object tells a story, which is why new acquisitions are always exciting events at the Canadian Museum of History. Recently, thanks to the generosity of the Rou\u00e9 family, we acquired the William James Rou\u00e9 Collection, which connects Canadians to Canada\u2019s most famous naval architect, William James Rou\u00e9 (1879\u20131970).\nWhat was life like for a busy 20th century naval architect? What did his office look like? What tools did he use? And how did Bluenose, Rou\u00e9\u2019s most famous vessel and Canada\u2019s iconic schooner, come to be?\nThe Bluenose story began in 1920 at the International Fishermen\u2019s Trophy, a race between working fishing schooners from Nova Scotia and Massachusetts. It is no secret that Canadians have never enjoyed losing to our neighbours to the south. So, after the Americans won the first race in 1920, the Canadian committee was determined to return the following year with a schooner that would leave the Americans \u201cin its wake.\u201d They asked the largely self-taught Rou\u00e9, who was dividing his time between working at his family\u2019s soft-drink firm and pursuing his passion of naval architecture, to design a winning schooner for the next year\u2019s race.\nBluenose Class sloops sailing in the Northwest Arm of Halifax Harbour. Seventy years after Rou\u00e9 designed this sailboat, many still sail in Canada and the United States and new examples are still being built. William James Rou\u00e9 Collection, Canadian Museum of History, 2016-H0034.161.P1, IMG2016-0300-0008-Dm\nRou\u00e9 came up with Bluenose, and the rest is history. The Canadian schooner took home the International Fishermen\u2019s Trophy in 1921, but its success did not stop there. It held the title against American challengers through to the last race in 1938, and this continued racing success made it an enduring symbol of Nova Scotia and of Canada. Bluenose represented Canada at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair and the Silver Jubilee of King George V. It appeared on a 1929 postage stamp and, from 1937 onwards, has graced the Canadian dime. It brought Rou\u00e9 to national and international attention, ultimately allowing him to leave the family firm and devote himself full time to his biggest passion: designing vessels.\nOver more than half a century of activity, Rou\u00e9 designed some 200 vessels, ranging from pleasure and racing craft to ferries, fishing boats and an innovative sectional cargo barge for Britain\u2019s Ministry of War Transport during the Second World War.\nRou\u00e9\u2019s extraordinary career speaks volumes about 20th century wooden ship and boat building and about our country\u2019s multi-faceted relationship with the ocean. To help highlight the 100th anniversary of Bluenose, in 2021, the Museum will present a special display on William James Rou\u00e9, giving visitors the opportunity to step into this fascinating chapter of Canadian history.\nThese artifacts from William James Rou\u00e9 Collection will be on display in the new Canadian History Hall.

But this raises an important question: How can we be certain that an artifact is authentic?\nMore than 3 years ago, the Halter family of Winnipeg approached Museum historian and curator Timothy Foran with a robe. The family believed that it was worn by magistrate Hugh Richardson when he presided over the three most famous court cases in Canadian history: the trial of Louis Riel for high treason in late July 1885 and the trials of P\u012btikwahanapiw\u012byin (Chief Poundmaker) and Mistahimaskwa (Chief Big Bear) for felony treason later that summer, in Regina.\nThere was no doubt that Richardson\u2019s robe would be an important addition to the Hall. Its inclusion would represent a formative though unhappy chapter of our colonial history: the 1885 North-West Rebellion and its aftermath. But would Foran and other Museum experts be able to prove that this robe belonged to Richardson?\nThe Halter family strongly believed that the robe in their possession had been worn during the Riel trial. This belief had inspired them to safeguard it as an heirloom ever since G. Sydney Halter, a prominent Winnipeg lawyer and civil rights advocate, had been entrusted with it in the 1940s. Foran respects the Halter family, calling them great friends of the Museum, and he wanted to believe that the robe was \u201cthe real McCoy.\u201d However, his job was to discover the truth. So, putting on the mantle of devil\u2019s advocate, he set out to disprove the family\u2019s claim.\nAfter over 3 years of investigation, all the pieces of evidence make a sound case for the robe having been wore by magistrate Hugh Richardson who presided over the three most famous court cases in Canadian history. Canadian Museum of History, 2013.54.1\nThe Museum investigates\nThe most obvious way to do so would be to find the Richardson robe in someone else\u2019s possession. Foran consulted archives, newspapers and other historians, but was unable to find evidence contrary to the Halter family\u2019s oral history.\nNext, he collaborated with colleague Caterina Florio, the Museum\u2019s expert in textile conservation. They sent the robe to the Canadian Conservation Institute for analysis, which revealed that the cloth had been mordanted with chromium and dyed with logwood, a technique popular in the 1870s, when Richardson became a magistrate. This dyeing technique produced a colour known as \u201cchrome black,\u201d which has the unfortunate characteristic of fading to a drab greenish-grey. This is the exact colour of the robe.\nThe next fact to investigate was that the robe in question is not a judge\u2019s gown, but a humble barrister\u2019s robe. Wouldn\u2019t Richardson have worn a judge\u2019s robe to preside over these important trials? No, said the legal historians Foran consulted. For a number of reasons particular to the justice system at that time, Richardson would indeed have worn a barrister\u2019s robe during the state trials of 1885. And, according to an expert on court dress, the robe shows signs of wear, tear and repair that could reflect Richardson\u2019s extensive circuit-court travels throughout Western Canada.\nA conclusion is reached\nEvery avenue Foran explored led to the same conclusion. There is no evidence to disprove the Halter family\u2019s oral history.

Every detail of this major project has been carefully considered \u2014 including one that you won\u2019t be able to see.\nAcoustics is not something that most visitors think about, unless it is overlooked, in which case we notice its absence: echoes bounce off walls, and sound from one exhibit bleeds into the next. There are so many sources of sound in a museum, from the crowd of visitors to the air conditioning unit, that the potential for a chaotic racket is enormous.\nIt\u2019s hard enough to control sound in a large, open environment like the new Canadian History Hall, but what if you also want to maintain its iconic architecture? And what if that architecture, while visually stunning, acts as a giant echo chamber? We\u2019re talking about the Hall\u2019s magnificent domed ceiling.\nThe Canadian History Hall team, led by Chantal Amyot and including Douglas Cardinal \u2014 the Museum\u2019s original architect extraordinaire \u2014 called on acoustic design expert Steve Haas to help. Sometimes referred to as a \u201csound cop,\u201d he specializes in the delivery and control of sound, and he immediately identified the dome as a main acoustic challenge.\nThe solution to the dome\u2019s acoustic challenge was to treat the ceiling with a fibrous spray material. The process involved careful planning and \u2026 a lot of scaffolding.\nThe team needed a way to gain control over the dome aurally without compromising its iconic look. As Haas explained, a ceiling needs to be a neutral canvas of sound. \u201cYou have to think about what happens to the audio recording of an exhibit once it goes past the audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to be absorbed somehow.\u201d\nIf the dome were left untreated, it would not tame the sound; instead, it would send it careening around the rest of the space. It would be like having an art gallery with walls made entirely of glass, Haas explained. Imagine trying to look at a painting in the glare of a sunny day; all the details would be washed out. A barrier is needed so that the exhibits can be considered clearly by themselves. Sure, you can\u2019t see his sound barriers, but you\u2019d notice if they were missing!\nThe solution was to treat the 30,000 square foot ceiling with a fibrous spray material. Like most things worth doing, it was hard work. It involved a lot of time, careful planning and a lot of scaffolding, said Amyot. \u201cIt was a very involved process,\u201d she said, \u201cbut now a big piece of the puzzle is done!\u201d\nAnd the effort of preserving this and other iconic architectural features is certainly worth it. \u201cThere is a soul to this space,\u201d explained Amyot. \u201cIt lives and breathes the content in such a harmonious way.\u201d\nLuckily, thanks to the team\u2019s tremendous efforts and attention to details \u2014 even the invisible ones \u2014 the new space can boast aural as well as visual harmony when it opens its doors on July 1, 2017.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/toboggan/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Toboggan", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-01-02 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, A-8524, IMG2013-0142-0027-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/happy-new-year-2017/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Happy New year 2017!", "author": "", "timestamp": "2017-01-01 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, photo Henri Durand, K73-3482\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/reverend-walter-henry-stiles-with-his-horse/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Reverend Walter Henry Stiles with his horse", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-12-25 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Edwin Lester Brittain, PR2004-015.16.2-58\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/seasons-greetings-holiday-cards-from-the-collection-of-the-canadian-museum-of-history/", "category": "Significant Dates", "title": "Season\u2019s Greetings: Holiday Cards from the Collection of the Canadian Museum of History", "author": "\u00c9liane Laberge", "timestamp": "2016-12-21 00:00:00", "text": "Canadians of all cultural backgrounds celebrate in a variety of ways at this time of year.

Perhaps, in the decades following the fort\u2019s destruction, it had been used for short-term stays by passing hunters and their families, given that the land is high, well-drained and relatively flat.\u00a0Another explanation could be that Europeans now living in the area of the former Indigenous camp used the Old Fort as a place to dispose of their refuse, which included bones from the various animals upon which they depended for survival: mostly caribou, ducks and geese.\nArchaeological research project along the lower Severn River. Canadian Museum of History. Photo: Jean-Luc Pilon, IMG1609\nWith these questions in mind, we set about attempting to match what we could perceive of Christianson\u2019s excavation units to his map of the work he had done on the site. Unfortunately, the Old Fort had become quite overgrown. Nature had been slowly reclaiming and erasing human history.\u00a0We laid out an excavation unit measuring 50 cm x 2 metres, in order to see whether re-occupation of the Old Fort could be identified by the soil stratigraphy: the sequence of soil layers and their archaeological contents.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/playing-skip-rope-in-the-arctic/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Playing skip rope in the Arctic", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-12-11 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, 14987 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/pull-toy/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Pull toy", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-12-11 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 979.9b.7, S94-25977\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/psychoacoustics-the-social-side-of-sound/", "category": "Canadian History Hall", "title": "Psychoacoustics: The Social Side of Sound", "author": "Sylvain Raymond", "timestamp": "2016-12-07 00:00:00", "text": "Have you ever heard of psychoacoustics? It has to do with the subtle considerations of how people experience sound: how the sound is delivered and who the intended listener is. It\u2019s an essential part of any museum experience and yet, as acoustic consultant Steve Haas acknowledges, sound design is so underrated that the sign of a job well done is that no one even notices.\nHaas has been managing sound in the world\u2019s top galleries and museums for the past 25 years, and he is the expert who has been called in to help with the acoustic challenges facing the new Canadian History Hall. The Director of Creative Development and Learning for the Hall, Lisa Leblanc, helped Haas identify and cater to the Canadian Museum of History\u2019s primary audience: families.\nSound design is an essential and often underrated part of any museum experience. The new Canadian History Hall offers some acoustic challenges of its own. IMG2014-0106-0024-Dm\nHistorians, tourists and others visit the Museum individually, but the majority of visitors come as groups, and the end result is quite a social experience. Kids make noise, people discuss displays and families interact \u2014 so how can we ensure that each group isn\u2019t disturbing everyone around them?\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lively space,\u201d Haas said. \u201cThe subject matter does not preclude that, so we have to take in that psychology.\u201d Inclusiveness is built into displays: some exhibits encourage kids to sit and interact with an element while the adults stand behind and discuss what they see and hear. Focused speakers allow sound to travel upward to reach a small group in the direct vicinity, and then continue on to be absorbed into the ceiling. Alternatively, if the speakers were throwing sound horizontally across large spaces, the result would be a mess of sound bleeding between exhibits.\nEvery element of a display has a social consideration: text is created with the goal of being read out loud, headphones are minimized and even the content of sound is carefully deliberated. A chirping bird has a much different impact on the listener than a roaring T. rex, and present-day sound bites are heard much differently than archival material, and sound technicians must incorporate these expectations into the design. Occasionally, content dictates a more intimate experience \u2014 for instance, some displays covering the topic of residential schools are arranged with a chair and overhead mesh to offer an enclosed, private experience.\nThough the idea of the Canadian History Hall is to present a continuous thread that connects us all through a shared history, it\u2019s important that the acoustics allow each group of visitors to express themselves in a contained way. Sound complicated? We hope not. If everything goes as planned, you won\u2019t even notice.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/dogsled-on-front-street/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Dogsled on Front Street", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-12-04 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Larss & Duclos, J6126-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/snow-goggles/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Snow goggles", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-12-04 00:00:00", "text": "\nCanadian Museum of History, IX-C:4775, S97-5093-Dp1\nSnow goggles like these have been used in the North for a long time.

Our goal was to go beyond the well-documented lives of leaders and elites to explore the lives of ordinary men, women and children. Further impetus to do this came from a variety of sources, including the public engagement exercise that we undertook in 2012\u20132013, and from feedback received from the Canadian History Hall advisory committees encompassing academics and community representatives.\nHarvest ring. Inscription: John Elliot Manufacturer/of this jug. When this you/see remember me 1846\nJohn and Heather Harbinson Collection, Canadian Museum of History, 2007.22.41\nTo meet our goal, we created a guiding principle that we called the \u201cHuman Experience.\u201d This was one of six principles we developed to help guide our choices as we made decisions about what to present and how to do so in the exhibition. We defined the Human Experience as follows:\n\u201cCanadian history is the lived experiences of the real people of the past, and their stories are the beating heart of the exhibition. Aspects of the human experience, such as universal themes, the expression of emotion and perception through the senses, help transcend time and place, and deeply connect the subjects of the exhibition and its visitors.\u201d\nWe then looked closely at the exhibition storyline in a series of \u201cHuman Experience\u201d workshops. Our aim was to humanize content, particularly in cases where the subjects were unknown and had left little documentary evidence behind. For each story, we asked who was involved and whose voices should be heard. We explored which key activities or experiences we felt it important for the visitor to encounter. We also considered the emotional qualities of the story and looked for universal themes to help connect with visitors. The exercise helped shape the story we needed to tell, giving us artifact possibilities and, often, ideas for how to present the stories in engaging ways.\nSpinning wheel, early 1800s. Canadian Museum of History, D-8830\nThese results, and our ongoing attention to the human experience, have shaped the galleries you will see when the Canadian History Hall opens on July 1, 2017. In Gallery 2, for example, a part of the exhibition focuses on the ways in which massive English-speaking immigration transformed colonial Canada, and we highlight the settlement of Upper Canada. To help humanize a story of such immense scale, we chose objects with a personal connection or ones that could be used to interpret peoples\u2019 lives. For instance, to bring to life immigration, we chose to display a trunk used by Irish immigrant Thomas Elliot. We also selected a variety of artifacts related to work and domestic life, which will give visitors a glimpse of how families cleared the land, earned a living, established homes and lived from day to day. And to give voice to these people, personal accounts from settlers will be available in audio format for visitors to hear.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/men-cutting-ice/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Men cutting ice", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-11-27 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, John Johnston O\u2019Neill, 38376\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/diamond-point-armoire/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Diamond-point armoire", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-11-27 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, no.

Canadian Museum of History, 2011-H0024, H-786, f6. Canadian Museum of History, IMG2014-0057-0001-Dm\nOf all the figures who have emerged onto the Canadian political scene, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Leader of the federal Liberal Party from 1887 to 1919 and Prime Minister from 1896 to 1911, was perhaps the most popular. \u201cLaurier had the gift of being loved,\u201d noted former Liberal minister, Charles Gavan (\u201cChubby\u201d) Power. Like certain rare political figures \u2014 such as Abraham Lincoln and John F.\u00a0Kennedy in the United States \u2014 Laurier was able to transcend party lines, attaining the status of a national icon long after details of his political exploits were forgotten.\nThis affection was prevalent among Laurier\u2019s Liberal followers, of course, but could also be found in his political opponents: nationalist Henri Bourassa and his supporters (although they still accused him of being \u201ca sell-out\u201d) and, at the other end of the spectrum, pro-British imperialists (who still found him, by contrast, insufficiently loyal to the Crown). Even when they did not approve of his actions, people could not bring themselves to hate him. Laurier remained in high regard long after his death in 1919, and \u201cLaurierism\u201d extended far beyond the political milieu. Today, villages and universities are named after Laurier, and his likeness can be found on everything from cigar boxes to marble statues to our five-dollar bill.\nHow to explain Laurier\u2019s aura? He represented \u2014 and continues to represent \u2014 an idealized Canada. He was bilingual and was seen as unifying, conciliatory and pragmatic. In addition, he stayed true to his French-Canadian origins, he took pleasure in the company of English Canadians, and he respected new Canadians. Laurier expressed an abiding love for all regions of the country. Finally, he was elegant, refined and eloquent \u2014 which lent prestige to his fellow citizens \u2014 all while remaining charming, jovial and approachable. He was also cultured and urbane.\nFor Laurier, politics meant more than a minor struggle to win a county here and there with promises of a road or a post office. Although he was well aware that \u201celections are not won by prayers,\u201d as his ally Joseph-Isra\u00ebl Tarte once said, he preferred to aim higher. The speeches in which he described his concept of liberalism, for example, or those in which he paid homage to both France and the British Empire, demonstrated that Laurier was a man of ideas \u2014 and that, for him, political engagement was a matter of values and principles.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/thetford-mines/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Thetford Mines", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-11-13 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, photographer unknown, Q 3.2.47 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/projectile-point/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Projectile point", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-11-13 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, RbJu-1:1083, IMG2008-0583-0123-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/new-severn-post-archaeological-project-the-excavations-begin/", "category": "Museum Research", "title": "New Severn Post Archaeological Project: The Excavations Begin", "author": "Jean-Luc Pilon", "timestamp": "2016-11-09 00:00:00", "text": "\nThis is the fourth post in a series by Dr. Jean-Luc Pilon about the work he is conducting as part of the New Severn Post archaeological project.\nOne of the great challenges posed by the site where we worked for most of the month of August is the vegetation that now hides and protects the location. In 1982, relatively low bushes of willows and alder were sprinkled around open, grassy areas. We could easily see the bricks and pits left behind by souvenir hunters. We could also see many stumps of fairly large trees that had been felled, it appeared, following a forest fire many years earlier.\nThis fire and subsequent harvesting of the standing timber were likely what led to the site\u2019s discovery by southern visitors. Local people told me how these visitors used shovels to dig around the fort, apparently finding old bottles. One story recounted how bricks were removed and shipped to Toronto, where they were used to decorate a new fireplace. How much of the history of this location was destroyed by those souvenir hunters?\nIn the summer of 2015, during a brief visit to relocate and inspect the site, much hard work was required to find it. A forest of spruce and poplar trees \u2014 with a thick ground cover of Labrador Tea, as well as willows and alders \u2014 now covered the location. It was challenging, to say the least! But we eventually succeeded.\nRelocating our 1982 excavations, however, proved much more difficult. Oddly enough, two distinctive tree stumps led us to the area where the brick hearth apron had originally been discovered. Using these two stumps, and pairing them with 1982 photographs, we laid out a grid for our work, which we hoped approximated the 1982 grid. That way, we could continue to expand the area excavated around the European-made apron.\nThe work was painstaking. The first step involves clearing each grid square of its surface vegetation and debris. Then, using very sharp trowels, we scrape away thin layer after thin layer of soil, noting changes in colour and texture.

Since 2014, it has been used by students and teachers across the country as part of an educational program developed by the CSA and the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, in partnership with the Canada Science and Technology Museums Corporation.\nSome specific challenges\nThere were a few challenges involved in the production of this composite view of Canada. The entire map is actually a mosaic of 121 satellite images captured by RADARSAT-2. To correctly assemble the map, the CSA had to know the precise location of the satellite when each image was taken.\nThe main challenge was to acquire each image without interfering with other satellite operations. Because the satellite is tasked with a wide range of functions by various government bodies, the CSA had to jump on any vacant window of opportunity, however small, to take a \u201csnapshot\u201d when the satellite was passing over an area not yet imaged. Moreover, because satellite images reflect what\u2019s actually taking place on Earth, it was important to make sure that the images were all acquired at about the same time of year. Fortunately, the CSA managed to avoid seasonal variations by covering all parts of the country during the month of May 2013, making for a more realistic and homogenous end product.\nNeedless to say, as the central nexus of the new Canadian History Hall, the Hub is going to be a heavy traffic zone. To make sure that the image remains vibrant for years to come, it has been printed on the type of reinforced vinyl commonly used for sidewalks and roads.\nWhether viewed close-up or from a vantage point one floor above, this stunning map has captured features from sea to sea to sea. Perhaps this is only fitting given that, when it opens on July 1, 2017, the Canadian History Hall will share the compelling story of the land beneath our feet, from the time of its earliest arrivals 15,000 years ago to the present day.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/mont-albert-gaspe-peninsula/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Mont-Albert, Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-10-23 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Rudolph Martin Anderson, 56533 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/objectives-of-the-new-severn-post-archaeological-project/", "category": "Museum Research", "title": "Objectives of the New Severn Post Archaeological Project", "author": "Jean-Luc Pilon", "timestamp": "2016-10-19 00:00:00", "text": "\nThis is the third post in a series by Dr. Jean-Luc Pilon about the work he is conducting as part of the New Severn Post archaeological project.\nIn 1982, part of our work focused on Feature B of site GlIw-1: the location of the \u201cOld Fort\u201d built by the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company (HBC) in 1685 and destroyed in 1690. Feature B is located about 50 metres to the east of the ruins of the palisaded fort. When first discovered, this area was noteworthy for its piles of red bricks, red-brick tiles and small yellow \u201cFlemish bricks,\u201d all visible on the surface.\nOur excavations at that time showed that there had been an important Indigenous occupation during a critical time in the history of the Severn River Basin. In a large hearth feature, around which many different activities had taken place \u2014 the preparation, cooking and consumption of meals; the manufacture and repair of equipment; etc. \u2014 we found stone tools, as well as the small flakes left behind from the making of these tools. There were also tools made of bone and antler, and sherds of distinctive Indigenous pottery. Intermingled with these items were trade goods obtained from the nearby HBC post. We recovered pieces of steel knives, parts of copper kettles, fragments of clay pipes, glass beads, musket balls, etc. There was even a prune pit, likely from fruit offered as a gift by the British during a ceremony preceding actual trading.\nBut why all of these bricks, which also appeared to have been disturbed by souvenir hunters in the 1960s or 1970s? In our work, we tried to address this question. We eventually found what appears to have been a brick apron in front of a fireplace, along with wooden structural elements that may be the remains of beams and joists. Together, these suggest that there had been some kind of European building at this location.\nWith this project, we hope to learn more about the European presence. If we can find a distinct soil layer associated with the construction of the European building \u2014 and artifacts in that soil \u2014 perhaps we will be able to identify the ethnic identity of the builders.\nAll this depends to a great extent on the site itself. The vegetation has greatly changed over the past 34 years, and the locations of our previous work areas are exceedingly difficult to locate.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/horses/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Horses", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-10-16 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, photographer unknown, 36.21 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/maurice-richards-hockey-stick-2/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Maurice Richard\u2019s hockey stick", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-10-16 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 2002.81.32, IMG2008-0631-0001-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/video-nice-women-dont-want-the-vote/", "category": "Exhibitions", "title": "Video: \u201cNice Women Don\u2019t Want the Vote\u201d", "author": "\u00c9liane Laberge", "timestamp": "2016-10-13 00:00:00", "text": "\nThe Museum has just opened \u201cNice Women Don\u2019t Want the Vote\u201d, a special display developed by the Manitoba Museum to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women\u2019s enfranchisement in the province.

Among other things, its population has more than doubled. As a result, there was a pressing need to provide basic services to a growing population, which was increasingly integrating into the world beyond the Hudson Bay Lowlands.\nThis fall, Fort Severn will open a brand-new school for children from kindergarten through Grade 8.

By the end of the 1690s, all of the HBC forts were under French control, except for a single post on James Bay. This situation would last until all the posts were returned to England with the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Did the French return to the mouth of the Severn to trade with the people who lived in the vast fur-rich territory of the Severn River?\nSome archaeological remains found outside the HBC fort suggest that the French may have built a house there, perhaps just for summer use.

The Museum achieves this in part by regularly presenting special exhibitions and displays from a variety of Canadian cultural institutions. We are currently showing a display about the Klondike gold rush from the Bank of Canada Museum. For this latest blog post, we invited Graham Iddon, Writer for the Bank of Canada Museum, to share some insights about this special display.\nWhile closed for renovations, the Bank of Canada Museum has no physical space to show its exhibitions. To keep the doors open, so to speak, we have been producing exhibitions to be shown in host institutions. For the past three years, the Canadian Museum of History has been kind enough to put us up while our house is being renovated, providing us with a large display case on the lower level. In June 2016, we opened our third display \u2014 Mining the Miners.\nWhen you press a button, the building opens up to reveal its content. Don\u2019t worry, each description is only 80 words; bilingual panels always look a little overwhelming. Photo: Bank of Canada Museum\nThis special display features the Klondike gold rush. But it\u2019s not about the prospecting, the mining, or even the gold itself. We left that to the exhibition Gold Rush! \u2012 El Dorado in British Columbia. Instead, Mining the Miners is about the secondary aspects of a gold rush \u2014 in this case, the extraordinary Klondike economy and the two banks that competed for business there.\nAll these building models were based on real gold rush era buildings from Dawson City. The Monte Carlo still exists, but it\u2019s in a different building now.\nIt\u2019s a surprisingly fun subject, full of anecdotes about the combination of greed, obsession and hardship that was the Klondike gold rush. Mining the Miners tells the tale of the adventures involved in setting up a bank in the remote Yukon interior, and the unique challenges the staff faced operating in a wild frontier town where the rule of law didn\u2019t always apply. In that extraordinary era of history, bartering was common and supplies were scarce; there were times when salt was worth its weight in gold. The cost of living is an ever-present subject that permeates the entire display, which also explores who made the real money during the Klondike gold rush.\nThe features of the building show great attention to detail. This building still stands and is now the Palace Grand Theatre. Photo: Bank of Canada Museum\nEvery place and time \u2014 even a barter economy \u2014 has its own requirements for money. The National Currency Collection is home to coins, cheques, bank notes and tokens specific to the Klondike gold rush. Bank notes stamped with \u201cYukon\u201d and \u201cDawson\u201d are displayed alongside promotional tokens from dance halls, saloons and small businesses. Such tokens were used in exchange for purchases in a marketplace where few coins existed. In fact, until the banks came to Dawson, the common currency of the Klondike was gold dust.\nThese bank notes from our collection were all specially marked for use in the Klondike during the gold rush.

Nash. Canadian Museum of History, photo E. Laberge\nWhen it opens on July 1, 2017, the Canadian History Hall will feature about 1,800 artifacts that illuminate the history of Canada and its people from earliest times to the present day. All of these will be authentic historical objects with very few exceptions, the most notable of which will be a full-scale reproduction of a 10-metre canot du ma\u00eetre, or Montr\u00e9al canoe.\nIn the late 1700s and early 1800s, Montr\u00e9al-based fur interests \u2014 particularly the North West Company \u2014 used such birchbark canoes to transport trade goods from Montr\u00e9al to Fort William at the head of Lake Superior, and to transport furs back from that location to Montr\u00e9al. The canot du ma\u00eetre was ideally suited to this back-and-forth journeying: it was strong enough to carry a tremendous weight (4 tons of cargo and 12 voyageurs), light enough to portage around rapids and between waterways, and simple enough in construction that it could be repaired with materials found on the shores of the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes (birchbark to mend breaks, spruce root to sew pieces of bark together and spruce or pine gum to waterproof seams).\nSadly, few if any canots du ma\u00eetre have survived into the 21st century in a condition that would allow us to exhibit them, hence the need to have this one built to be displayed in the section of the Hall that tells the fur trade story. The canoe is the modern handiwork of master canoe builder Richard (Rick) M. Nash of Dorset, Ontario.\nMoving the canot du ma\u00eetre into the Canadian History Hall for its installation. Canadian Museum of History, photo E. Laberge\nFor over four decades, Nash has studied and documented Indigenous and fur trade canoe-building techniques. He has acquired extensive hands-on experience in applying these techniques, having built dozens of canoes using traditional materials, tools and methods.\nHe made this particular canot du ma\u00eetre over four seasons in 2013. In winter and early spring, he set out on snowshoes to harvest sheets of birchbark and solid pieces of cedar and spruce. In summer and autumn, he built the frame with simple hand tools (an axe, a crooked knife and an awl), sewed on bark panels, lashed on gunwales with spruce root and sealed the craft with pitch.\nThe canot du ma\u00eetre being installed in the Canadian History Hall.

Piskorz\nNash\u2019s canoe \u2014 like its precursors built in the workshops of late 18th century Montr\u00e9al \u2014 reflects a convergence of Indigenous and Euro-Canadian experiences. To meet the transport needs of Euro-Canadian traders, the first builders of canots du ma\u00eetre adopted and adapted techniques perfected over centuries by Indigenous Peoples. Their canoes conveyed mixed crews of French-Canadian and Haudenosaunee voyageurs back and forth between an enclave of European settlement (Montr\u00e9al) and Anishinaabe homelands in the distant West.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/children-playing-on-the-shore/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Children playing on the shore", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-07-31 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Clyde L.

But perhaps more importantly, we aimed to find a format that would travel well and could reach audiences across the country, to share the Museums\u2019 content with those who may not be able to visit in person.\nThe souvenir catalogue series\nSeries design\nWe settled on a small, square, softcover format \u2014 one that fits comfortably in your hands. The series is designed with a simple, flexible grid that allows each book to highlight the exhibition content and design, while maintaining a consistent look.\nEach book includes full-page colour photos of artifacts, artwork and historical images. We wanted to bring these objects to life and highlight interesting details that might be missed during a Museum visit.\nA page from the Terry Fox catalogue\nThe catalogues are written by the curator(s) and generally follow the narrative of the exhibition, with captions to describe the objects and works featured. If you visited the exhibition on a busy day, you might enjoy the chance to revisit the panel descriptions. As well, reading the catalogue, you may just discover a new detail that wasn\u2019t in the show.\nEvolution\nIn four short years, the Museum of History and the War\u00a0Museum have published 16 souvenir catalogues. The very first was about the Haitian spiritual tradition of Vodou, and we have since covered topics ranging from the ancient Greeks to women in times of war.\nThe Museums\u2019 first graphic novel\nIt has been a challenge to keep a common thread throughout the series, while being flexible enough to best feature these very different subjects. For example, the authors of the Terry Fox catalogue wanted to take a\u00a0different approach,\u00a0inspired by a scrapbook, featuring news clippings and historical photos with excerpts from Terry\u2019s diary.\nMore recently, we published our very first graphic novel, in the same series format but fully illustrated. This approach melded perfectly with the graphic novel presentation of the Deadly Skies exhibition, now showing at the Canadian War Museum.\nAnd while most of the books have been about special exhibitions, we\u2019ve also featured the iconic Grand Hall and LeBreton Gallery. A catalogue about the War Museum\u2019s Second World War gallery is currently in the works.\nComing soon\nWe are already planning a book about that most Canadian of subjects, hockey \u2014 keep an eye out for it in early 2017.

As obvious as it may be today to see women voting, the movement to secure votes for women was socially divisive. This important milestone in Canadian history is thus the theme of this year\u2019s Canada History Week, held from July 1 to 7.\nTo commemorate the first voting rights for women in Canada, the Canadian Museum of History partnered with the Manitoba Museum on a display celebrating this significant anniversary. For this latest blog post, we invited Dr. Roland Sawatzky, Curator of History at the Manitoba Museum, to share some insights on the creation of the display.\n\u201cNice women don\u2019t want the vote\u201d \u2014\u00a0these words were attributed to Manitoba Premier Sir Rodmond Roblin during a heated conversation with Nellie McClung in 1914, when the women\u2019s suffrage movement was in full swing. Two years later, Manitoba became the first province to grant some women the right to vote.\n\u201cVotes for Women\u201d pennant, felt, 1913\u20131915\nPennants and sashes were used to display loyalty to the cause. The use of gold in the North American women\u2019s suffragist movement has its origins in the sunflower, a symbol of Kansas, where an early campaign was defeated in 1867.\nDonated by Warren West, Manitoba Museum, H9-38-198\nWhen the Manitoba Museum developed an exhibit to commemorate the 100th anniversary of these rights, we decided to use Roblin\u2019s famous words as the title. It was a good choice: eyebrows were raised. We also wanted to do two other things with the exhibition: feature real artifacts from the period, and provide Canadians with a way to \u201crediscover\u201d the story by looking at it in new ways.\nThe first problem with our project was that we didn\u2019t have many artifacts from our own women\u2019s suffrage movement. So we did what most museums do in a situation like this: we reached out to the public for help. As curator of the exhibition, I made a number of appearances on television and radio, and gave newspaper interviews.\nWoman\u2019s moccasins, late 19th century, silk embroidery on caribou and moose hide, unidentified female Cree artisan, Norway House, Manitoba\nWhile other Manitoban women won the vote in 1916, the maker of these beautiful shoes would have been denied the vote in federal elections for another 44 years.\nManitoba Museum, H4-0-779.\nIn the week following this media blitz, we received some interesting, unexpected and very welcome responses. The tweets and emails rolled in, with one common theme: Indigenous women didn\u2019t get the vote in 1916. This is a topic we intended to include in the exhibition and teachers\u2019 guides, but the issue didn\u2019t come out in our early media conversations.\n\u201c[NO] VOTE FOR WOMEN,\u201d cedar siding, 1910\u20131915, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba\nThis is a section of exterior wall from a house that formerly stood just north of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.

Her husband later painted \u201cNO\u201d above this sign.\nLoan courtesy of the Wishart family of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba Museum\nI was excited that people had been paying attention, and had brought up the topic so forcefully. I knew that from now on we would have to be explicit about the fact that women (and men) of Treaty status could not legally vote unless they gave up their Treaty rights. This only changed in 1952 in Manitoba, and in 1960 for federal elections.\n\u201c[NO] VOTE FOR WOMEN,\u201d cedar siding, 1910\u20131915, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba\nThis is a section of exterior wall from a house that formerly stood just north of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.

These ranged from objects as small as a watch fob to things as large as graffiti from an exterior house wall. Photographs of a women\u2019s suffrage picnic near Roaring River, a \u201cVotes for Women\u201d pennant, and ceramic pieces were all gratefully accepted.\nThe collection reminds us that a huge grassroots movement helped push the women\u2019s suffrage debate. For example, a replica of an 1894 petition for women\u2019s voting rights includes over 5,000 signatures. While well-known leaders shaped the arguments, thousands of women and men from rural farms and urban factories gave the movement energy and purpose.\nWatch fob owned by Roy A. Ireland, 1910s, Minitonas, Manitoba\nLoan courtesy of the descendants of Gertrude Twilley Richardson and Fanny Twilley Livesay, Manitoba Museum\nThe collection and related exhibit also remind us that this debate was happening largely within white, English-speaking, Protestant, newcomer society, leaving out Indigenous voices, as well as many Eastern European immigrant communities. The attainment of universal voting rights for Canadians did not progress in a straight line.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/forest-fires/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Forest fires", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-07-03 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, photographer unknown, 564 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/typewriter/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Typewriter", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-07-03 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 2009.55.15.1, IMG2010-0124-0001-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/moments-in-time-27-years-of-memories-at-the-canadian-museum-of-history/", "category": "Significant Dates", "title": "Moments in time: 27 years of memories at the Canadian Museum of History", "author": "\u00c9liane Laberge", "timestamp": "2016-06-29 00:00:00", "text": "On June 29, 1989, the Canadian Museum of Civilization (today\u2019s Canadian Museum of History) officially opened its doors to visitors in Gatineau, Quebec.

Many scholars and Indigenous Elders and leaders have helped us along the way. In 2013, we started with six committees to advise us: a general committee for the overall development of the Hall\u2019s content, three committees responsible for distinct periods in Canadian history, an Aboriginal Advisory Committee and a Women\u2019s History Committee. We have benefited greatly from their specific expertise and perspectives.\nIn the summer of 2014, we streamlined the six committees into the two that continue today: the General Advisory Committee, with one new member nominated by the Women\u2019s History Committee, and the Aboriginal Advisory Committee. You\u2019ll find a list of all our committee members here.

Now, by participating in this Canada 150 project here at CMH, I like to think that in some small way I am carrying his important work forward, while providing a legacy for my own daughter, Quinn Kateri, to one day carry forward in her own way and time, and indeed for seven generations and beyond.\nQ: Any final thoughts?\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/engraved-walrus-tusk/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Engraved walrus tusk", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-06-19 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 2008.112.11, IMG2009-0166-0018-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/two-men-salmon-fishing/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Two men salmon fishing", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-06-19 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, photographer unknown, Q 19.1.42 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/first-peoples-of-canada-smoking-pipes-from-the-canadian-museum-of-history/", "category": "Spotlight on the National Collection", "title": "First Peoples of Canada: Smoking pipes from the Canadian Museum of History", "author": "Jean-Luc Pilon", "timestamp": "2016-06-16 00:00:00", "text": "Calumet pipe, Ojibwa, Upper Great Lakes, 150\u2013250 years old, Wood\nCanadian Museum of History, III-G-884a, b\nJune is National Aboriginal History Month in Canada \u2014 a time to celebrate the heritage, cultures and contributions of First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit.

The final post in this series focuses on smoking pipes from the Great Lakes region of Canada.\nPipe, Attawandaron (Neutral), Southern Ontario, 350\u2013500 years old, Limestone\nCanadian Museum of History, VIII-F:8550\nSmoking tobacco, a plant domesticated on the American continent, and other plant derivatives occupied an important place among several of Canada\u2019s First Nations, well before the arrival of Europeans during the 16th century. Smoking as a social and private activity was, in fact, brought back to the Old World by early European travellers.\nThe Huron/Wendat believed that inhaling tobacco smoke opened up both mind and spirit. Smoking was thus an important activity and often preceded important discussions.\nPipe, Unknown culture, Southern Ontario, post-1600, Catlinite\nCanadian Museum of History, VIII-F:8569\nPipe, St. Lawrence Iroquoian, St. Lawrence River Valley, approximately 450 years old, Ceramic\nCanadian Museum of History, VIII-F:12005\nThe history of smoking can be traced through objects believed to have been used to consume a wide range of plant materials. Early examples include highly polished stone cylinders, while later implements resemble modern pipes, with separate bowl and stem. Over time, they were elaborately decorated with a range of recurring, traditional motifs. This suggests that the images reflect a body of symbolic attitudes towards smoking. Interestingly, the human or animal faces that often adorn these pipes are looking directly into the smoker\u2019s eyes, as if to convey an important message to that person.\nStudying historical objects such as these is fascinating, as it allows us to better understand the cultures and ways of life of the First Peoples of Canada\u2019s Great Lakes region. It also helps us gain greater appreciation of the knowledge and ancient bond with the land that the First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit all share.\nPipe, St. Lawrence Iroquoian, St. Lawrence River Valley, approximately 450 years old, Ceramic\nCanadian Museum of History, VIII-F:12005\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/canadian-geological-survey-of-canada-expedition-in-northern-quebec/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Canadian Geological Survey of Canada Expedition in Northern Quebec", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-06-12 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Albert Peter Low, 1892\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/tommy-douglas-bible/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Tommy Douglas\u2019 Bible", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-06-12 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, III-I-1374, RARE BS 185 1900z B34, IMG2013-0066-0005-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/first-peoples-of-canada-ceramic-containers-from-the-canadian-museum-of-history/", "category": "Museum Research", "title": "First Peoples of Canada: Ceramic containers from the Canadian Museum of History", "author": "Jean-Luc Pilon", "timestamp": "2016-06-08 00:00:00", "text": "June is National Indigenous Peoples Month in Canada \u2014 a time to celebrate the heritage, cultures and contributions of First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit.

In this latest post, the focus will be on ceramic containers from Canada\u2019s Great Lakes region that were used for cooking and storage.\nCooking pot, Point Peninsula culture, Central Ottawa Valley, about 2,500 years ago\nCeramic\nCanadian Museum of History, CaGi-1:1\nPot, Mohawk, Southern Ontario, made by Elda Smith, 1973\nCeramic\nCanadian Museum of History, III-I-1374\n\nEarthenware pots are often associated with sedentary agricultural peoples throughout the world; but this concept can be misleading and doesn\u2019t always hold true. Although the first manufacturing of ceramic containers in North America can ultimately be traced to Mexico \u2014 and even farther south into Central America \u2014 knowledge of ceramic-making entered the Great Lakes region about 1,000 years before the first cultivation of plants in the area, suggesting the vessels had little to do with agriculture. Moreover, ceramics have been made at different times by peoples who never grew agricultural crops.\nLarge cooking or storage container, Southern Lake Huron, 700\u20131,000 years ago Ceramic Canadian Museum of History, VIII-F:29977\nArchaeologists have defined several ceramic-making traditions, based on the ages of the pots as well as the techniques employed in their manufacture. Older ceramic vessels in the Great Lakes region, dating to between 2,500 and 1,000 years ago, were made with a coil technique whereby long strips of tempered clay were wound upwards to form the walls of the pots. Ceramics produced after about 1,000 years ago employed modelling techniques, in which large masses of clay were shaped into containers.\nCeramics often allow for the study of perishable aspects of ancient material culture. For example, impressions of basketry and woven textiles are often found on the surfaces of clay pots, because the potters textured the exterior \u2014 and sometimes the interior \u2014 surfaces of the clay before it dried. Without the evidence literally embedded in the clay, very little would be known today about these intricate arts, since baskets and textiles are very rarely preserved at archaeological sites.\nCooking pot, St. Lawrence Iroquoian, Central Ottawa Valley, about 450 years ago\nCeramic\nCanadian Museum of History, VIII-E:14\nCooking/storage pot, Western Basin Tradition, Western Lake Erie, 350\u2013500 years ago\nCeramic\nCanadian Museum of History, AdHo-1:141\n\nThe Canadian Museum of History\u2019s collections hold many examples of ceramic containers made by Indigenous peoples of the Great Lakes, some of which are on display in the First Peoples Hall.\nKeep an eye on this blog for my next feature highlighting the history and heritage of Canada\u2019s First Peoples.

No smelting or refinement of the ore is required. In the Great Lakes region of North America, deposits of native copper have been used to manufacture tools and objects of personal adornment for nearly 7,000 years.\nKnife, Laurentian Archaic, Ottawa Valley, 6,100 years ago\nNative copper\nCanadian Museum of History, BkGg-11:1053\nTo produce the fine native copper implements recovered from archaeological sites throughout North America, detailed knowledge of the metal\u2019s characteristics was necessary, along with a process that compensated for some of these characteristics. For example, while native copper can be shaped and thinned by cold hammering, the hammered metal eventually becomes brittle and cracks. However, heating the metal modifies its physical properties, allowing cold hammering to resume. This allowed the production of very thin and delicate artifacts, such as jewellery and knives, that were both functional and aesthetically pleasing.\nPendant Late Archaic, Lake Superior, 3,000\u20134,000 years ago\nNative copper\nCanadian Museum of History, DiJa-1:48\nIn ancient times, there were several regions in North America where native copper was easily found and used. One rich source was the western portion of the Lake Superior basin. Copper from that region was traded across vast distances \u2014 sometimes thousands of kilometres away. The extent of these trade networks reflects the great value placed on this metal in ancient times.\nSpear point or knife, Late Archaic, Lake Superior, 3,000\u20134,000 years ago\nNative copper\nCanadian Museum of History, DiJa-1:44\n\u201cThey frequently carry [pieces of copper] in their medicine-bags; they are carefully wrapped up in paper, handed down from father to son, and wonderful power is ascribed to them.\u201d\n\u2014 Johann Georg Kohl 1860:60\nThe Canadian Museum of History\u2019s collection has a spectacular array of artifacts made of native copper, dating from various periods \u2014 including projectile points, knives, adzes, fish-hooks, awls, eyed needles, bracelets and pendants \u2014 pointing to the importance and versatility of this metal among Aboriginal peoples.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/porthole-from-the-empress-of-ireland/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Porthole from the Empress of Ireland", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-05-29 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 2012.21.439.1, IMG2012-0281-0004-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/francois-vallee-with-his-cart/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Fran\u00e7ois Vall\u00e9e with his cart", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-05-29 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Marius Barbeau, 43440 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/first-peoples-of-canada-war-clubs-from-the-canadian-museum-of-history/", "category": "Spotlight on the National Collection", "title": "First Peoples of Canada: War clubs from the Canadian Museum of History", "author": "Jean-Luc Pilon", "timestamp": "2016-05-26 00:00:00", "text": "June is National Aboriginal History Month in Canada \u2014 a time to celebrate the heritage, cultures and contributions of First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit.

To mark National Aboriginal History Month, the Museum is highlighting the history of the First Peoples by presenting artifacts from the national collection that tell the stories of Aboriginal cultures of the Great Lakes, starting with war clubs.\nThe Aboriginal populations of the Great Lakes developed complex systems of community, military alliances and spiritual beliefs, as well as distinctive decorative styles. The cultivation of beans, squash and maize was the basis for permanent villages in the Lower Great Lakes, and the economic foundation of Iroquoian societies.\nThe social organization of the Iroquoian societies of the Great Lakes was centred on women, and the kinship relationships between them. The agricultural fields belonged to groups of related women, as did the longhouses in which they lived. A man left his own family group to live with his wife\u2019s family, and his children became part of their mother\u2019s group.\nWar club, Iroquoian (?), Central Great Lakes, 200\u2013400 years old\nWood, copper (?), lead, feathers, animal hide\nCanadian Museum of History, III-X-342\nWhile women were responsible for growing food and managing households, men were hunters, fishermen and traders.

This type of combat would, however, continue in a limited form as the Iroquois came to be recognized as both fearsome foes and worthy military allies.\nAfter the mid-19th century, many war clubs were made for ceremonial rather than combat purposes.\u00a0The Canadian Museum of History\u2019s collection includes some exquisite examples of ceremonial war clubs made by Aboriginal peoples of the Great Lakes, some of which are on display in the First Peoples Hall.\nWar club, Ojibwa, Upper Great Lakes, Date unknown\nWood\nCanadian Museum of History, III-G-818\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/frank-bolton-singing-into-a-phonograph/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Frank Bolton singing into a phonograph", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-05-22 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Marius Barbeau, 69595\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/dionne-quintuplet-dresses/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Dionne Quintuplet dresses", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-05-22 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 994.13.1-5, IMG2009-0063-0089-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/international-museum-day-2016-museums-and-cultural-landscapes/", "category": "Connecting with Canadians", "title": "International Museum Day 2016: Museums and Cultural Landscapes", "author": "\u00c9liane Laberge", "timestamp": "2016-05-18 00:00:00", "text": "International Museum Day 2016 poster, courtesy of ICOM\nEvery year on and around May 18, cultural institutions and culture lovers worldwide mobilize in celebration of International Museum Day, an annual event launched in 1977 by the International Council of Museums (ICOM). International Museum Day provides cultural institutions with an opportunity to actively engage with the general public, while also marking the important role that museums play in our societies.\nThis year\u2019s theme, Museums and Cultural Landscapes, is meant to encourage people to think of museums as more than just buildings that house objects, and instead to consider the role museums play in helping visitors to engage in different ways with ideas about various cultural landscapes, both near and far.\nAt the local level, one of the ways in which the Canadian Museum of History encourages this engagement is through its architecture. Thanks to the vision of Douglas Cardinal, many of the architectural features of the Museum\u2019s iconic buildings on the shore of the Ottawa River reflect aspects of Canada\u2019s great cultural landscapes. Douglas Cardinal has also incorporated the cultural landscape of the Ottawa River into his plans for the new Canadian History Hall. The Rotunda of the new Hall, for example, reflects the \u201cGreat Kettle\u201d of nearby Chaudi\u00e8re Falls, which is just one part of the ancient cultural landscape of which many of our visitors \u2014 local residents included \u2014 may be unaware.\nMuseums and other cultural institutions play an essential role in preserving our shared history, imparting our heritage to visitors today and protecting this heritage for future generations. As a national institution, however, it is imperative for the Museum of History to fulfill this role on a national scale by actively engaging with communities beyond its physical walls. In addition to encouraging visitors to reflect upon local cultural landscapes, the Museum of History has a number of programs and initiatives designed for Canadians across the country, helping to create a more dynamic approach to history \u2014 one that encourages cultural exchange, cultural enrichment and the development of mutual understanding between cultures. As such, the Museum is dedicated to ensuring that the history of Canada and its peoples is accessible, comprehensive and communicated in a way that allows Canadians to feel connected to the events, experiences, peoples and objects that have shaped our past. The Museum partly achieves this through travelling exhibitions, virtual resources, community outreach and social media.\nTake, for example, our online exhibitions. Developed by the Museum in collaboration with multiple partners, these virtual resources are one way of making history available and accessible to all Canadians. Have a look at the range of virtual exhibitions on our website to get a better sense of how the Museum uses technology for learning purposes.\nAnother prime example is the RBC Aboriginal Training Program in Museum Practices, a professional internship providing participants with the technical training they need to make important contributions to Canada\u2019s museum sector and to their respective communities. This unique initiative, created by the Museum in 1993, equips First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit participants with tools to support Indigenous communities across Canada in sharing their unique stories and traditions in concert with cultural institutions. Using the skills they acquire through this 8-month learning opportunity, several graduates have gone on to have a major impact on the cultural landscape.\nThe Museum\u2019s travelling exhibitions also enable Canadians across the country to connect with their history. Working hand in hand with other cultural institutions across Canada and around the world, the Museum is able to bring artifacts from the national collection \u2014 as well as images, historical documents and audiovisual elements \u2014 to museums and cultural centres in Canada and overseas, giving more people the opportunity to learn about different aspects of history within their local communities.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/suffragette-flag/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Suffragette flag", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-05-15 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 2010.232.1, IMG2012-0263-0004-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/delegation-of-indian-chiefs-from-western-canada/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Delegation of Indian Chiefs from Western Canada", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-05-15 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Edward Sapir, 36002\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/the-canadian-history-hall-helping-visitors-understand-the-complexity-of-canadas-past/", "category": "Canadian History Hall", "title": "The Canadian History Hall: Helping visitors understand the complexity of Canada\u2019s past", "author": "Lisa Leblanc", "timestamp": "2016-05-11 00:00:00", "text": "The Museum\u2019s new signature gallery, the Canadian History Hall, is the most extensive exhibition on Canadian history ever produced. Covering a 15,000-year period from the earliest known human habitation to the present day, it highlights key stories from Canada\u2019s past and explores Canada as it is today, as well as how it came to be.\nBecause history is rooted in the experiences of real people, the Hall is making their stories the core of the exhibition. These myriad narratives, often expressing disparate points of view, shape an exhibition integrating multiple perspectives within an expansive storyline. This approach helps to unlock history\u2019s complexities, while also ensuring that subtleties are brought to light, that opposing voices are heard and that visionary ideas and actions are clearly expressed.\nIn the Canadian History Hall, the story about Canada\u2019s westward expansion will include a good example of multiple perspectives. Euro-Canadians, M\u00e9tis and First Nations had very different visions of the West in the 1870s and early 1880s. Euro-Canadians envisioned the region as the final piece in their transcontinental Dominion. (Hon. Donald A. Smith driving the Last Spike to complete the Canadian Pacific Railway. Alexander Ross. Library and Archives Canada. C-003693)\nWhat does it mean when we talk about including multiple perspectives in the Hall? Well, very broadly, it means taking into account and representing the roles, experiences and interpretations of a range of people in relation to a given topic or event. In most cases, it also means including the voices of those with direct experience of that topic or event \u2014 in other words, the views of those who were actively involved, providing at times leading or even dissenting voices.\nThe M\u00e9tis envisioned part of their homeland as a province within Confederation \u2014 a place where their rights, culture and property would be protected. (Councillors of the Provisional Government of the M\u00e9tis Nation. Library and Archives Canada. PA-012854)\nWhat will multiple perspectives add to the visitor experience? First and foremost, this approach provides visitors with a better grasp of the many, and often disparate, roles and points of view that have shaped our past. In addition, it allows visitors to consider \u2014 and perhaps even empathize with \u2014 dissenting and minority voices, while better comprehending the intentions of both the majority and a visionary or two. A perspective-based approach also helps contextualize the past, showing how different groups and individuals have helped shape the country we know today.\nPlains and West Coast First Nations envisioned maintaining their sovereignty and way of life in the face of encroachments by newcomers and perceived outsiders. (Niisitapiikwan signatories to Treaty 7: Three Bulls (Siksik\u00e1), Sitting Behind Eagle Tail (Piikani), Crowfoot (Siksik\u00e1) and Red Crow (Kainai). Glenbow Museum. NA-4035-159)\nWill these multiple perspectives be obvious to visitors? Throughout the development and planning process for the Hall, a multi-perspective approach has been applied to every story to varying degrees. The Museum has viewed variables such as gender, class, ethnicity and regional experiences as key factors when it comes to shaping and defining our knowledge and interpretation of Canada\u2019s past. In some cases, multiple perspectives structure the primary narrative, with support from clearly identified individual perspectives. In others, first-person accounts have been used extensively to define and explain various experiences and outcomes.\nPlains and West Coast First Nations envisioned maintaining their sovereignty and way of life in the face of encroachments by newcomers and perceived outsiders. (Chief 7IDANsuu, Charles Edenshaw with his engraving tool and a selection of his works, c. 1885. CMH 88926-Dm)\nThe Hall has integrated multiple perspectives within the scope of 15,000 years of history to help visitors understand and connect with the richness and complexity of this country\u2019s past. Such an approach enables the Museum, as storyteller, to forge a bond with visitors, while sharing powerful and compelling narratives with audiences ready to invest in them. It is about making a human connection \u2014 making the stories that have shaped our history matter, while also offering a comprehensive and balanced presentation of the history of Canada and its people.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/dorothy-clayton-on-horseback/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Dorothy Clayton on horseback", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-05-08 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Harlan Ingersoll Smith, 55790\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/billy-club/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Billy club", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-05-08 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, 2006.40.1, IMG2009-0063-0012-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/canadian-museum-of-history-2016-2017-exhibitions-season/", "category": "Uncategorized", "title": "Canadian Museum of History 2016-2017 exhibitions season", "author": "\u00c9liane Laberge", "timestamp": "2016-05-04 00:00:00", "text": "\nBattles for justice.

It was built in 1907 in Smoky Lake, Alberta and later transported to the Canadian Museum of History, where our conservators reassembled it, piece by piece, complete with its original ritual objects, religious decor and furnishings. The church was reconsecrated inside the Museum in 1996, and the local Ukrainian community still uses it for certain religious ceremonies.\u00a0This historical building resonates with me because it continues to create tangible memories for Ukrainian Canadians. The fact that visitors can touch the walls of the church and know it is an actual artifact often leaves them with a sense of awe.

I\u2019m always amazed at the depth of information that heraldry can convey with such efficiency. The Canadian coat of arms is a symbol that many of us take for granted.

This is because much of the archaeological record, especially for Indigenous Peoples in Canada, pertains to hunting, gathering and daily life. Artifacts that clearly relate to spirituality are rarely preserved and recovered. This is frustrating for archaeologists, given that oral histories describe a vibrant and rich spirituality that permeated nearly every aspect of ancient Indigenous life.\nOften, when we study the ancestors of modern Indigenous Peoples, we can use their historical accounts and oral histories to project recent spiritual beliefs into the past \u2014 this is called the \u201cdirect historical approach.\u201d While this method can be problematic (for instance, it assumes that Indigenous spiritual beliefs did not change over time), it has proven useful when critically applied. But what can be done when the ancient people we are studying have disappeared, leaving no genetic or cultural descendants?\nSuch a case presents itself with the Dorset, a hunting and gathering people who lived in the Canadian Arctic between 700 and 2,500 years ago. Like their Palaeoeskimo predecessors, the Dorset hunted many Arctic species, including caribou and muskox, but many sites indicate that they specialized in hunting seals. Mysteriously, they abandoned technologies and practices known to their ancestors, like the bow-and-arrow, watercraft and the keeping of dogs. They dressed in clothing with a unique high collar to block the wind and dwelt seasonally in massive communal tent structures called longhouses.\nAn Ivory carving of a polar bear diving and/or \u201cLying Still-Hunting.\u201d Canadian Museum of History, IMG2014-0118-0011-Dm\nNamed for Cape Dorset, where their artifacts were first identified, the Dorset are best known for their spectacular ivory, antler, wood and stone carvings depicting people, animals and hybrid creatures. Preserved by the permanently frozen soils of the Arctic, this \u201cart\u201d provides an unparalleled window into Dorset spirituality and their relationship with the natural world.\nIn addition to humans, the most frequently depicted animal in Dorset art is the polar bear, which appears in a variety of forms and poses. Hundreds of polar bear carvings have been recovered from Dorset sites all over the Canadian Arctic and Greenland.\nI have been fascinated with these carvings since I began my archaeological studies at the University of Toronto in the early 1990s. Why did the Dorset carve polar bear effigies so frequently, and what did it reveal about their spirituality and conceptualization of their place in the world?\nWooden polar bear carving with an inserted sliver, next to a human carving with a incised slot. The two may have been made to be joined together. If so, they indicate a very close spiritual connection between the Dorset and polar bears. Canadian Museum of History, IMG2014-0118-0007-Dm\nWhen I began working at the Museum in 2007, I finally had an opportunity to study the largest collection of Dorset art in the world. I looked through the Museum\u2019s collection and noticed that the shapes and poses of the polar bear carvings repeated themselves, and that these forms often appeared to mimic behaviour I had seen in photographs of bears in the wild. Several years later, Marianne Kleist (Hardenberg), a Greenlandic archaeologist, provided additional data from collections around the world from her dissertation on Dorset art. With this expanded collection in hand, I began to hypothesize that these carvings were actually representations of real polar bears doing natural things. I speculated that if I could decode what these behaviours were, it might reveal why polar bears were so important to the Dorset.\nThe only problem with this line of inquiry was that I had never seen a polar bear in the wild and, while I had some ideas, I felt unqualified to interpret polar bear behaviour from the carvings. So, I reached out to Ian Stirling, one of the world\u2019s foremost polar bear researchers. A Scientist Emeritus with the Canadian Wildlife Service, Ian was enthusiastic about participating in the project, despite his extremely busy schedule. I sent him multiple photographs of the carvings, and he quickly determined that the Dorset were depicting polar bears in natural poses \u2014 and, moreover, that almost all of the art showed polar bears in hunting stances related to stalking and hunting their preferred prey, seals.\nThese insights were novel because previously the polar bear carvings had been interpreted as portraying bears in fantastical poses, representing \u201cspirit\u201d bears moving between spiritual realms. Some had even been interpreted as \u201cflying bears.\u201d What did this new information mean for the interpretation of Dorset spirituality?\nAn ivory carving of a polar bear engaged in \u201cStanding Still-Hunting.\u201d , Canadian Museum of History, IMG2014-0118-0009-Dm\nWe began to explore this by considering what the Dorset were actually doing when they observed and encountered polar bears. While the Dorset exploited a broad range of animals, many of their sites indicate that they spent much of their time seal hunting at ice leads \u2014 in the very same habitat where polar bears preferred to hunt seals. The Dorset were observing polar bears hunting seals, at the same time and in the same way that the Dorset themselves were pursuing seals.\nI believe the polar bear effigies may have been used to remind and teach the Dorset the proper methods of hunting seals \u2014 using stillness, stealth and cunning. The carvings may also have been used in a ceremony to draw hunting prowess from the effigies and the polar bears they represented, to increase the hunter\u2019s chance of success.\nBut I think it is possible to reveal an even deeper meaning in the polar bear carvings. Polar bears and the Dorset shared a way of living at the ice edge, hunting seals. Perhaps the polar bear became a way for the Dorset to think about and symbolize their place in the world. In effect, by making the carvings, the Dorset signalled \u201cThis is who we are.\u201d\nJournal Reference:\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/emily-carrs-hooked-rug/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Emily Carr\u2019s hooked rug", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-03-06 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, F-642\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/on-the-ski-slope/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "On the ski slope", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-03-06 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, unknown photographer, 89173 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/staff-picks-favourites-from-the-canadian-museum-of-history/", "category": "Behind the Scenes", "title": "Staff Picks: Favourites from the Canadian Museum of History", "author": "\u00c9liane Laberge", "timestamp": "2016-03-02 00:00:00", "text": "Nico\u2019s Pick: Bedtime Story\nNicolas Franco, Training Coordinator\nNicolas Franco, Canadian Museum of History, IMG2013-0023-0011-Dm\nWhen I led the First Peoples of Canada school program, I always ended the students\u2019 visit under Sky Woman, the sculpture by Shelley Niro in the First Peoples Hall.

From time immemorial, Canada\u2019s First Peoples have lived in close relationship to the land and, very early on, developed modes of transportation such as snowshoes and toboggans to get around. As for newer arrivals, for centuries they have had to contend with snow, cold temperatures and a climate that may be quite different from their homelands.\nSnow has always influenced the way Canadians live.

The opening ceremonies will be held at the Museum on Sunday, February 28, and are open to the public.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/lovers-guide/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Lovers\u2019 guide", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-02-14 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, HQ 801 G854 1898, IMG2009-0027-0001-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/west-side-of-the-victoria-memorial-museum-building/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "West side of the Victoria Memorial Museum Building", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-02-14 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, photographer unknown, 71850 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/mapping-2015-collections-activities/", "category": "Collections Management", "title": "Mapping 2015 Collections Activities", "author": "Kerri Davis", "timestamp": "2016-02-11 00:00:00", "text": "As we settle into 2016, we thought this might be a good time to reflect back on last year\u2019s activities and take stock of what was accomplished.

Only the Library of Parliament survived.\nRecords indicate that the blaze started in the House of Commons Reading Room, possibly due to careless smoking. It spread quickly, fuelled by paper and varnished wood panelling.

While the fire burned, Borden and his Cabinet met at the Chateau Laurier, where they discussed possible temporary homes for Parliament. The Victoria Memorial Museum \u2014 a precursor to the Canadian Museum of History and the Canadian Museum of Nature \u2014 was immediately converted into a makeshift chamber to conduct the nation\u2019s political business. Reconstruction of the Centre Block was undertaken that same year, officially beginning on July 24. The new building was not completed until November 11, 1928, when the central Memorial Tower, today known as the Peace Tower, was officially opened.\n100 years later, key artifacts and archival photos from the fire bear testimony to this tragic episode in Canadian history, giving us a better understanding of this significant incident.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/photo-of-the-week-7/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Photo of the Week", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-01-31 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Edwin Lester Brittain, PR2004-010.66.6-590\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/vlog-update-from-chantal-amyot-director-of-the-canadian-history-hall-project/", "category": "Canadian History Hall", "title": "Vlog update from Chantal Amyot, Director of the Canadian History Hall Project", "author": "\u00c9liane Laberge", "timestamp": "2016-01-28 00:00:00", "text": ""}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/photo-of-the-week-5/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Playing skip rope", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-01-24 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Vilhjamur Stefansson, 14987 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/mittens/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Mittens", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-01-24 00:00:00", "text": "Canadian Museum of History, III-H-408, IMG2008-0583-0049-Dm\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/photo-of-the-week-6/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Crowd and dogsleds", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-01-17 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Joseph E.

This has meant a great deal of expert consultation. Two groups have been involved: community and stakeholder groups, and our expert advisory committees. I will focus here on the advisory committees; community consultation will be the topic of a future blog post.\nWe began with six committees, organized during the project\u2019s first year in 2013. Each had between four and seven members, chosen for their expertise in a relevant field. Most were university professors (many being professors of history, sometimes retired, often eminent); others were Indigenous elders, leaders and scholars. There was a general committee, which looked at the overall development of the Hall\u2019s content; three committees responsible for distinct periods in Canadian history; an Aboriginal Advisory Committee; and a Women\u2019s History Committee.\nAn early design concept for one section of the Canadian History Hall. IMG2014-0106-0008-Dm\nWe met with these committees several times over the next year or so, sending them reams of paperwork, including research files and \u201cblue sky\u201d planning documents. During this period, we were working hard to find our way, to establish our storyline or narrative arc, and to choose \u2014 from amongst an almost infinite number of stories and events \u2014 just what we were going to present. Each committee was made up of individuals holding quite different, sometimes even competing, views on Canadian history (as indeed do the Museum\u2019s expert staff). During discussions, however, we were able to hammer out a rough outline of Canadian history.\nWe also got a great deal of specific advice. The Women\u2019s History Committee spoke with one voice on the importance of \u201cgendering\u201d history \u2014 of including women and women\u2019s perspectives without tokenism. The Aboriginal Advisory Committee stressed the absolute importance of Indigenous history and Indigenous perspectives. All committees corrected errors and highlighted the importance of alternative views and correct language, even in planning documents, which no one else would see. This was particularly the case with Aboriginal history, the correct usage of self names (\u201cHaudenosaunee\u201d rather than \u201cIroquois\u201d) and the need to avoid Eurocentric expressions such as \u201cNew World\u201d (it wasn\u2019t new to everyone).\nRunning six committees was an immense amount of work and, in the summer of 2014, we merged and dissolved the committees down to two, which continue today. There is a General Advisory Committee, consisting of the old general committee with one new member nominated by the women\u2019s history committee, and an Aboriginal Advisory Committee. We have met face to face with each four times since the reorganization and, as our focus becomes clearer, we are beginning to consult on a more one-on-one basis with individual members who have expertise we particularly need.\nThe inception of exhibition design has changed things considerably over the past year or so. We have an external design firm \u2014 gsmprjct\u00b0 of Montr\u00e9al \u2014 and are working hard with them to translate our exhibition ideas into exhibition spaces. This has imposed increasing discipline on our ongoing conversations, both internally and with our advisory committees. No longer do we have apparently infinite space to develop and exhibit complex stories about our national past, or an infinitely expanding storyline to which we can keep adding good ideas. We have to refine what we\u2019ve got, as we assemble the narrative that will form the Canadian History Hall.\nThe real value of advisory committees is that they provide a perfect forum for these kinds of discussions. As experts, committee members understand the field; and as outsiders, they provide new perspectives, new ideas we haven\u2019t thought of and knowledge we don\u2019t have. Advisory committees do just that: they advise. Responsibility resides with the Museum and final decisions are ours, but we wouldn\u2019t proceed without them.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/photo-of-the-week-4/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Photo of the Week", "author": "", "timestamp": "2016-01-10 00:00:00", "text": "CMH, Rudolph Martin Anderson, 70973 LS\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/john-a-macdonalds-coat/", "category": "Collection", "title": "John A.

Canadian Museum of History, IMG2015-0117-0013-Dm\nMaybe you\u2019ve already wondered how far back holiday festivities go in Canada. Well, Canadians have been celebrating Christmas and the holiday season since the colonial period and the arrival of the first European settlers. Over time, French, British, Aboriginal and American traditions have become intertwined, giving rise to new practices and beliefs that are truly Canadian.\nYour parents and grandparents might have told you Christmas stories when you were small, such as \u201cThe Flying Canoe\u201d \u2014 a story that occupies an important place in the memories and imagination of French Canadians. In fact, shortly after Eaton\u2019s began producing mail-order Christmas catalogues, author, poet and Qu\u00e9bec political figure Louis-Honor\u00e9\u00a0Fr\u00e9chette \u2014 well-known for his epic poem La L\u00e9gende d\u2019un peuple (\u201cLegends of a People\u201d) \u2014 published the work La No\u00ebl au Canada (\u201cChristmas in Canada\u201d) in 1900.\nThis collection of tales inspired by popular folklore was actually first published in English in 1899 by Ontario publisher George N. Morang & Co., under the title Christmas in French Canada, before being issued the following year in French. Fr\u00e9chette\u2019s collection features a wonderful variety of tales, some well-known, such as \u201ctales presenting the legendary Jos Violon\u201d, (Fournier, 1991), others less so, including \u201cLe violon de Santa\u00a0Claus\u201d (\u201cSanta Claus\u2019 Violin\u201d) and \u201cTemp\u00eate d\u2019hiver\u201d (\u201cWinter Storm\u201d).\nTitle page from La No\u00ebl au Canada (\u201cChristmas in Canada\u201d) by Louis-Honor\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chette. Canadian Museum of History, IMG2015-0117-0014-Dm\nThe Canadian Museum of History\u2019s rare book collection includes a copy of this wonderful old book, which reflects a rich oral tradition that Louis-Honor\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chette was careful to preserve. This particular edition is remarkably beautiful, decorated with corbelling and filigree patterns, and adorned with lovely ornate capital letters. According to Cap-aux-Diamants: la revue d\u2019histoire du Qu\u00e9bec, this first edition is considered rare because \u201calthough Fr\u00e9chette remains very well-known, there is no information about the public distribution of this collection of tales \u2014 for example, there is no way of knowing how many copies were printed.\u201d\nLouis-Honor\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chette bears witness to the evolution of Canadian Christmas traditions in a work filled with nostalgia, its stories brought to life with superb illustrations by painter Frederick Simpson Coburn. Throughout the volume\u2019s 288\u00a0pages, some 23\u00a0images enliven the author\u2019s Christmas tales, while lending them a touch of realism.\nIs there a Christmas story you\u2019re particularly fond of?

Susan Moore, courtesy of the family of Terry Fox.\nDuring the early days of the Marathon of Hope, Canadians began sending cards and letters to Terry Fox, and they continued to send him messages of support right up until his death. The family of Terry Fox kept all of the correspondence sent to Terry, which contained thoughtful messages of hope, admiration and goodwill.\nHere is a taste of some of the wishes sent to Terry Fox that are included in our exhibition, demonstrating just how closely Canadians connected with Terry right from the start:\nThe exhibition team worked with the Terry Fox Centre, the Museum\u2019s partner for this exhibition, to digitize all of the correspondence. The team also wanted to ensure that the letters were featured prominently in the exhibition, in part to show how profoundly this brave young athlete captured the hearts of his fellow Canadians.\nThe result was the \u201cDear Terry\u201d interactive display, a database allowing visitors to browse and search the approximately 65,000 cards and letters sent to Terry Fox by Canadians from all across the country during the Marathon of Hope. Available only in the exhibition itself, \u201cDear Terry\u201d is surrounded by a cloud of letters, immersing visitors in the emotions and intensity of the thousands of letters Terry received.\nPhoto of the \u201cDear Terry\u201d interactive display from the special exhibition Terry Fox \u2013 Running to the Heart of Canada at the Canadian Museum of History\nBeyond the sheer volume of the correspondence, it is striking to see the range of sentiments expressed in these letters of support. In his book Terry (2005), Canadian artist and author Douglas Coupland writes eloquently about the power of these letters, saying, \u201cI thought that after I\u2019d spent a few hours of sifting I\u2019d become immune to the sentiments expressed inside them, but no, I never did and I doubt I ever will. Their messages are too pure and too real. \u201d\nBased on feedback from visitors to the exhibition, it is safe to say that many of them share Coupland\u2019s feelings. Since the exhibition opened on April 1, 2015, the Museum has received many comments from visitors regarding both their positive experiences in the exhibition and their own memories of this remarkable Canadian. We have also been fortunate to hear from some of our visitors about their experiences discovering letters that they or their family members had sent to Terry more than 35 years ago. Some people even found letters they had no memory of writing!\nWe hope visitors to the exhibition during the holiday season will take a moment to look for letters that they or their relatives may have sent to Terry.

In fact, Canadians are reminded of his importance every time they glance at the portrait on our $5 bill.\nAs Canada\u2019s first francophone Prime Minister, Laurier can be credited with many things. He helped consolidate Confederation by encouraging compromises between French and English Canadians over language issues in education. He helped create the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. He supported the construction of two transcontinental railways, stimulating massive immigration \u2014 particularly to the Western provinces. He also helped define the extent of Canada\u2019s military commitments to the British Empire.\nThe Museum houses many artifacts related to Sir Wilfrid Laurier in its National Collection.

This device received Morse code signals. Canadian Museum of History, CN-75 a\nLong before the invention of cellular telephones, our forebears sent one another instant messages\u00a0by telegraph. Beginning in 1846, coded messages could be sent in Canada in the Morse alphabet: a code made up of short and long impulses (also known as \u201cdots and dashes\u201d). These messages were transmitted over long distances by cable, using telegraph technology and simple electrical current. Unlike today\u2019s text messages, however, messages sent by telegraph were hard to keep private. Sending a telegram required a qualified operator, who would need to transcribe the messages being sent and decode the messages received. Beginning in the 1850s, the upper middle class had become used to exchanging wishes and news by telegram. Some even enjoyed playing chess this way, sending one another telegrams indicating their last moves. It was the press, however, that would popularize the use of the telegraph, so much so that, towards the end of the 19th century, Canadians in some cities would mob telegraph offices to get the latest news, before publication of the next day\u2019s newspaper.\nIn Canada, telegraph lines were strung along railways, using available electric lines. As a result, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) company offered telegraph services. Partly thanks to the CPR, a trans-Canada telegraph line was completed in 1886 between Nova Scotia and British Columbia \u2014one year after the completion of the transcontinental railroad, which also stretched from Nova Scotia to British Columbia. It was, in fact, via an official telegram sent on November 7, 1885 by William Cornelius Van Horne, Director General of Canadian Pacific, that Sir John A. Macdonald, then-Prime Minister of Canada, learned that the last spike had been driven into the transcontinental railroad.\nTelegram announcing the driving of the last spike of the Canadian Pacific Railway (William Cornelius Van Horne, November 7, 1885 \u2014 Ink on paper, Library and Archives Canada, e000009485).\nThe first attempt at transatlantic telecommunication occurred in 1858, but it was not until 1866 that a functional telegraph cable was permanently laid between Europe and North America. At a time when ships took more than 10\u00a0days to cross the Atlantic, telegraph messages now took, in optimal conditions, only a few minutes.\nSection of transatlantic telegraph cable made in 1857 by Newall and Co. and used during the first telegraphic transmission between Europe and North America, in 1858. Canadian Museum of History, 2011.38.1\nThe next advance, at the beginning of the 20th century, was wireless telegraphy, invented by physicist and businessman Guglielmo Marconi (1874\u20131937). It would prove particularly useful for communication between ships at sea. When the Titanic sank in 1912, the transmission of an SOS message resulted in the rescue of no less than 700\u00a0passengers. From then on, seagoing vessels were obliged to use wireless telegraphy.\nBattery for a telegraph from the Empress of Ireland.

French scholar Pierre Le Loyer of La Brosse, born in Huill\u00e9, a village in the region of Maine-et-Loire in Western France, was a true demonologist, devoting a significant portion of his life to the study of demons and related beliefs. In 1586, he published his first book on spectres, in which he presented his ideas on demonology. In 1605, he wrote a revised and more complete version of the book, called Discours et Histoires des Spectres, visions et apparitions des esprits, anges, d\u00e9mons et \u00e2mes se montrant visibles aux hommes [A Treatise of Specters or Straunge Sights, Visions and Apparitions appearing sensibly unto men].\nThe Canadian Museum of History\u2019s copy of the work, Discours et Histoires des Spectres, visions et apparitions des esprits, anges, d\u00e9mons et \u00e2mes se monstrans visibles aux hommes [A Treatise of Specters or Straunge Sights, Visions and Apparitions appearing sensibly unto men]. Canadian Museum of History, IMG2015-0270-0003-Dm\nThe Canadian Museum of History\u2019s rare book collection includes a copy of this important work on demonology, which is considered one of the classics on the subject. According to what we know, it is also the oldest book in our collection. The work in question, divided into eight chapters, deals with extraordinary visions and other phenomena over the centuries. Using a number of ancient authors as sources, both religious and secular, Le Loyer details the causes of apparitions, the natures of spirits and demons, magicians and sorcerers, and how they communicate with spirits, among other things.\nThe Canadian Museum of History\u2019s copy of the work, Discours et Histoires des Spectres, visions et apparitions des esprits, anges, d\u00e9mons et \u00e2mes se monstrans visibles aux hommes [A Treatise of Specters or Straunge Sights, Visions and Apparitions appearing sensibly unto men].

In Le Loyer\u2019s opinion, there is a real difference between \u201con the one hand, an apparition that is the product of the human imagination (insane or not), which he calls a \u2018fantasm\u2019 and, on the other hand, the apparition of a Spirit who, of its own accord takes shape in the human imagination as a spectre.\u201d (Huot, p.\u00a0578).\nTitle page of the work Discours et Histoires des Spectres, visions et apparitions des esprits, anges, d\u00e9mons et \u00e2mes se monstrans visibles aux hommes [A Treatise of Specters or Straunge Sights, Visions and Apparitions appearing sensibly unto men] by Pierre Le Loyer.

Canadian Museum of History, IMG2015-0270-0005-Dm\nWas Le Loyer\u2019s work read in New France? There is no clear answer to this question. What we do know is that demons held an important place in the collective consciousness of French settlers, some of whom didn\u2019t escape demonic torments.

Over the next 41 years, Jeanne gradually carved the homes, cabins, stables and farms of her village. She also eventually produced miniature telephone poles, fences, woodpiles and horse-drawn carriages, re-creating her village down to its smallest detail. Finally, local woodcarvers \u2014 founders of the popular Saint-Jean-Port-Joli school of woodcarving \u2014 made dozens of tiny villagers, breathing life and humour into the miniature town.\nA close up of the home of villager George Gagnon.

Canadian Museum of History, photo K. Davis, 2015\nTo bring the exhibition\u2019s priceless objects to Canada, the Museum worked closely with PACART, a transportation company that specializes in the secure movement of art and antiques. PACART, one of the sponsors of the exhibition, worked tirelessly to transport the artifacts to Canada, while also handling the logistics associated with getting the objects off the plane and into each of the presenting museums in North America. Given that the objects \u2014 many of which are national treasures \u2014 were to be imported into Canada, then moved to four different locations over the span of several months, arranging everything was no small feat.\nExhibition preparators carefully place a marble sculpture of a hoplite in its shipping crate. Canadian Museum of History, photo K. Davis, 2015\nMovement of the objects involved four cargo shipments from Greece to Canada, and one hand-carried shipment: a case with its own seat on the plane.\nUpon arrival in Canada, the couriers who accompanied the artifacts from Greece were met by a member of the PACART team and escorted to the cargo warehouse to observe as the crates were unloaded and opened. The objects were then safely transferred to PACART trucks and strapped in for the ride to Pointe-\u00e0-Calli\u00e8re, Montr\u00e9al Archaeology and History Complex: a member of the exhibition consortium and the first stop on the exhibition\u2019s North American tour.\nFirst-class service for these priceless artifacts extended well beyond the airport\u2019s loading docks. Just as a visiting dignitary would be given a security detail, the artifacts travelled to the venue in style, under the watchful eye of Greek couriers, with armed security always in close proximity.\nA marble sculpture is lifted from its shipping crate into a display case. Canadian Museum of History, photo K. Davis, 2015\nIn addition to overseeing physical considerations, PACART assisted with the logistical aspects of transporting these objects across national borders. Moving items of such historical significance requires hours of legwork to complete the paperwork for customs clearance. All items need to be accounted for on paper each time they move across a border. Think of it as a very lengthy passport-and-visa application!\nThe art of moving art is not always simple. With more than 40 years\u2019 knowledge and experience, however, PACART was an ideal choice when it came to overseeing the safety and security of the priceless objects displayed in the exhibition.\nBut the job is only half-done. After closing at the Canadian Museum of History on October\u00a012, the exhibition will head to its next venue. PACART will once again be moving the Greek treasures, this time to The Field Museum in Chicago, where the exhibition opens in November.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/1867-who-was-the-most-important-of-the-founding-fathers/", "category": "1867 - Rebellion and Confederation", "title": "1867: Who Was the Most Important of the Founding Fathers?", "author": "\u00c9liane Laberge", "timestamp": "2015-09-30 00:00:00", "text": "\nIn the exhibition 1867 \u2013 Rebellion and Confederation, leading historians \u00c9ric B\u00e9dard, Charlotte Gray and Christopher Moore share their perspectives on some pivotal moments on the road to Confederation.\nIn this video, not included in the exhibition, they answer a key question about the birth of Canada: Who was the most important of the founding fathers?\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/braised-partridge-a-page-from-our-rare-book-le-cuisinier-francois/", "category": "Spotlight on the National Collection", "title": "Braised Partridge: A Page From Our Rare Book Le cuisinier fran\u00e7ois", "author": "Patricia Corrigan", "timestamp": "2015-09-23 00:00:00", "text": "As the summer draws to a close, some of us may find our meal plans changing from light summer salads and barbeque to those fall comfort foods that help keep us warm during the colder months.

In the Rare Book Collection at the Canadian Museum of History, there is a copy of one of the most influential cookbooks in early modern French cuisine, one that introduced cooks from all across Europe and the new world to new choices in cooking: Le cuisinier fran\u00e7ois.\nTitle page from Le cuisinier fran\u00e7ois\nThis seminal 17th century cookbook, written by Fran\u00e7ois Pierre de La Varenne, marked the beginning of a new era in cooking. In de La Varenne\u2019s recipes, fresh local herbs replaced the heavy use of imported spices that dominated the previous medieval style of cooking, sweet and savoury flavours were separated instead of being used in a single dish, and recipes were designed to complement the natural flavour of the main ingredient rather than mask it or imitate some other taste. Another major change was de La Varenne\u2019s preference for butter instead of lard. He also emphasized the use of fresh foods, especially vegetables, and included some of the \u201cNew World\u201d ingredients that had recently made their way to Europe from the Americas, such as turkey and the incorrectly named Jerusalem artichokes. Le cuisinier fran\u00e7ois was the first publication with recipes for b\u00e9chamel sauce and mille-feuille pastry, and it even includes an early form of hollandaise sauce in a recipe for \u201casparagus in fragrant sauce.\u201d\nThe first edition of Le cuisinier fran\u00e7ois was published in 1651. By 1653 an English edition had been produced, making it the first French cookbook to be translated into English. The publication influenced cooking all across Europe and even made its way to the New World, since copies were used in New France.\nThe Museum has the fifth edition of this influential cookbook, published in 1654 with the title Le cuisinier fran\u00e7ois, enseignant la mani\u00e8re de bien appr\u00eater & assaisonner toutes fortes de viandes, grasses & maigres, l\u00e9gumes & p\u00e2tisseries en perfection, etc. \u00a0The photograph below displays the recipe for partridge stew \u2014 a hearty recipe if ever there was one!\nRecipe for partridge stew from Le cuisinier fran\u00e7ois\nDe La Varenne\u2019s instructions read as follows (slightly modified from the original):\nBraised Partridge (Perdrix \u00e0 l\u2019estouffade)\nTake the Partridges and Lard them well. Put them in a Pipkin with Butter or melted Lard until they be reddened. Pot the birds in a good Broath, and leave them boyl until well seasoned. To garnish, add Truffels, Mushromes, Fricacie of Sporrages, and simmer the birds; serve with Lemmon and Pistaches. If the gravy be not thick enogh, add a small portion of Flower or other thickener; but add not o\u2019er-much, for fear that the Gravy become too thick.\nDe La Varenne\u2019s cookbook made recipes like this one available to anyone who could read, which made culinary knowledge easier to access. Still, as an admittedly amateur cook, I certainly appreciate that contemporary recipes provide a much more detailed, step-by-step approach!\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/textile-conservation-mukluk-liners-from-fort-mcpherson/", "category": "Conservation", "title": "Textile Conservation: Mukluk Liners from Fort McPherson", "author": "Caitlyn Picard", "timestamp": "2015-09-16 00:00:00", "text": "We all wear shoes.

As each object is unique, it is a challenge to find new and innovative ways of providing physical support. For the mukluk liners, we determined that two padded inserts with the same construction as the liners would provide the necessary form and make the entire treatment reversible, while still helping to maintain the original shape of the liners.\nPatches with silk layer\nWorking backwards to create a pattern seemed like a relatively straightforward task. Several sources in the literature indicated it would be a simple process of tracing the outline of the object and adding in darts or other common techniques used when fabricating clothing. However, when stitching the inserts together, I found it was not quite as simple as I was led to believe. Instead, it took several attempts to create the exact shape and structure of the liners \u2014 six separate attempts, to be exact!\nInsert with patches\nThe next stage of the treatment was to create several patches to fill the large holes and visually complete the look of the liners. The goal was to help minimize the appearance of the holes when looking at the object as a whole. Only upon closer study would the conservation work become apparent. The solution? Creating a needle-felted patch that would sit inside the hole and finding the correct colour match based on the current appearance of the mukluk liners. This was not only challenging but also a great opportunity to experiment with various types of materials, including different wools and silks. The final step of the treatment was to add a band of silk between two sections of the red embroidery to help complete the overall look and feel of the liners.\nRed silk band\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/building-canadian-history-one-brick-at-a-time/", "category": "Museum Research", "title": "Building Canadian History, One Brick at a Time", "author": "Jean-Luc Pilon", "timestamp": "2015-09-10 00:00:00", "text": "This \u201dFlemish\u201d brick was found in 2015, just about to be washed into the Severn River from the archaeological remains of a Hudson\u2019s Bay Company (HBC) post built in Fort Severn in the mid-1700s.

Since the author\u2019s previous visit to Fort Severn in 1984, some 30 feet of embankment have slid into the Severn River, carrying away irreplaceable pieces of Canadian history.\nThe Hudson\u2019s Bay Company (HBC) built a fortified trading post near the mouth of the New Severn River in 1685: a mere 15 years after the formal incorporation of the HBC in 1670 as \u201cThe Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson\u2019s Bay.\u201d\u00a0Fort Churchill \u2014 as the small Severn River post was known at the time \u2014 would not last long. The French were determined to eject the British from what they viewed as the northern fringes of rich fur-bearing lands that belonged to the St. Lawrence colony of New France.\u00a0Accordingly, on August 25, 1690, Pierre Le Moyne d\u2019Iberville sailed up the Severn River, Fort Churchill was burned to the ground and d\u2019Iberville spirited its harvest of rich furs back to Ville-Marie.\nThe HBC would not re-establish itself on the Severn River until the middle of the following century, building a new post several kilometres downstream from Fort Churchill, on the opposite side of the river.

For the past several years, the Canadian Museum of History has participated in this Arch\u00e9o-Qu\u00e9bec initiative by organizing activities aimed at making this fascinating scientific discipline more accessible to the average person. The Museum has a number of knowledgeable archaeologists on staff who undertake research projects that often lead to discoveries, revealing new information on various aspects of Canada\u2019s ancient history. Within the context of Archaeology Month, I wanted to share one of our most recent acquisitions, which has a lot to tell us about the history of First Nations.\nThe Museum recently acquired seven Aboriginal pottery vessels from the period before contact with Europeans. The vessels were found by sport divers in the deep waters of the St. Lawrence River near Kingston, Ontario. It is very rare to find complete or nearly complete Aboriginal vessels. This discovery thus gave us a golden opportunity to examine the overall shape of such vessels, as well as the layout of their various decorative elements.\nThanks to carbon dating and an analysis of the chemical composition of residues found on the vessels\u2019 inner walls, we now know much more about how old they are and how they were used. For example, we confirmed that four of the vessels were used to cook cervid meat (moose and deer), probably from deer. In addition, the oldest vessel would have been made nearly 2,000 years ago, and the most recent about five centuries ago.\nOne of the seven Aboriginal pottery vessels found in the St. Lawrence River that revealed the presence of caffeine. Canadian Museum of History, Photo: E. Laberge\nOne vessel revealed the presence of caffeine. At first glance it might seem that there has been some sort of contamination, but caffeine occurs naturally in two plants in North America, including cacao from the Yucat\u00e1n. The second plant, Ilex vomitoria, grows in states along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico and, at the time of the Europeans\u2019 arrival in the Mississippi Valley, was used to make a drink consumed by Aboriginal initiates. The plant prepared them for certain rites and ceremonies by purging them of all that was noxious or unhealthy in their bodies.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/a-glimpse-into-the-history-of-cobalt-ontario/", "category": "Significant Dates", "title": "A Glimpse Into the History of Cobalt, Ontario", "author": "John Willis", "timestamp": "2015-08-18 00:00:00", "text": "Edition of the Cobalt News-Herald from November 6, 1909, Canadian Museum of History, IMG2015-0054-0470-Dm\nOn August 7, 1903, two railway contractors in search of lumber for railway ties near Long Lake, Northern Ontario, discovered a substance that proved to be silver. By the end of that year, other discoveries were made. The news spread like wildfire from the press to would-be prospectors and investors. They came by the thousands up the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway to the town of Cobalt: English and French Canadians as well as Finns, Russians, Poles, Greeks and Italians. In 1905, 16 mines were active in the Cobalt area. By 1911, there were 34 mines producing 30 million ounces of silver. The population of Cobalt grew quickly from just 100 in 1903 to 10,000 in 1909. The silver boom was of national significance because it helped sustain stock exchange and investment frenzy in the financial markets of Montr\u00e9al and Toronto, and even on Wall Street.\nThis edition of the Cobalt News-Herald from November 6, 1909 shows a town still very much in the throes of a boom.\u00a0There are reports of three new strikes or silver veins. The statistics on ore shipments from eight different producers are impressive. On a more serious note, the newspaper reports that a few men experienced a close shave with death when the cage carrying them down the Temiskaming mine suddenly started to plunge.\u00a0Not evident on the Cobalt News-Herald\u2019s front page is the general hardship hundreds were still experiencing following a great fire that occurred earlier that year in July. The fire started at a Chinese caf\u00e9, leaving 150 buildings destroyed and 3,000 people homeless. Completely devoted to silver mining, Cobalt had been hastily built during the first years of the 20th century; there wasn\u2019t even a municipal water and sewer system. The place burned with considerable and deadly ease. Loss of life from the fire was not overwhelming; a young Italian man and a French (Canadian) girl, according to the Toronto Globe, were among the victims. However the fact that so many were forced to live out of doors, with their only source of drinking water coming from a contaminated water table, did produce a crisis situation. In the summer and fall of 1909 Cobalt experienced a typhoid outbreak in which 111 lost their lives. The fire of 1909 was a double-barrelled tragedy for the \u201csilver city\u201d of North Ontario.\nFind out more about this Cobalt News-Herald edition.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/video-over-500-priceless-artifacts-from-21-museums-across-greece-only-one-place-to-see-them/", "category": "The Greeks - Agamemnon to Alexander the Great", "title": "Video: Looking back at a historic trip to Greece which led to the presentation of The Greeks \u2013 Agamemnon to Alexander the Great", "author": "\u00c9liane Laberge", "timestamp": "2015-08-05 00:00:00", "text": "\nIn 2014, a team from the Canadian Museum of History travelled to Greece.

Paul showed the exhibition curator, Sheldon Posen, and me the items he was preparing: Terry Fox\u2019s iconic t-shirts from the Marathon of Hope. In our planning, Sheldon and I included the t-shirts as evocative examples of Terry Fox\u2019s unwavering focus on his mission to raise money for cancer research.\nI was, admittedly, blind-sided by the power of the objects that were laid out in front of us. Here I was, looking at four worn, stained, faded t-shirts that were precious examples of Canadian heritage. These were the real thing: Terry Fox had worn those t-shirts over 143 days and 3,339 miles during the summer of 1980.\nWe got down to details. Paul is an expert on, among other things, creating mounts that support fragile artifacts safely and securely. He made body forms that filled out the t-shirts, but didn\u2019t stretch them. We discussed the height and the volume of the mounts. We agreed that we wanted to suggest Terry\u2019s presence, but not be too literal in recreating Terry wearing them.\nFour of Terry Fox\u2019s Marathon of Hope t-shirts on display. Terry Fox communicated his mission with unwavering clarity in everything he did, including the t-shirts he wore. All of these artifacts are on loan from the family of Terry Fox.

Preparator Caroline Pilon showed us the mount she made not only to hold Terry Fox\u2019s artificial legs safely in place and on display, but also to make them accessible for visitors to study. Terry\u2019s artificial legs are key to understanding his ability to endure pain and his determination to overcome challenges. We decided that the two artificial legs \u2014 Terry\u2019s favourite and his spare \u2014 should be displayed almost as if we were face to face with Terry. If they were too high, they looked too abstract, too sacred. When we put them at human height, visitors could see how rudimentary they were, yet could also appreciate that these mechanical objects were capable of getting Terry halfway across the country.\nOne of the artificial legs that Terry Fox used during the Marathon of Hope.

Danny had packed the large glass jug so that it stayed unbroken and unspilled during its voyage by rumbling truck all the way from British Columbia to Gatineau, Quebec. It is now securely on display, still filled with the ocean water that Terry collected on the first day of the run.\nTerry Fox\u2019s jug of water from the Marathon of Hope.

We had been talking for months about the ability of the objects to tell the story of Terry Fox, accompanied by photos, texts, videos and interactive elements. Each time I saw one of the actual objects in person, however, I was impressed by its power.\nI am always fascinated by the expertise that is required to safely store, handle and display museum artifacts. I jump at any chance to see the behind-the-scenes work of my colleagues in collections. Theirs is a special type of expertise: they make it possible to share with our visitors the fragile parts of our heritage so that we can all experience being up close to the real thing.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/curators-choice-dr-jean-luc-pilons-insights-into-the-first-peoples-hall/", "category": "Connecting with Canadians", "title": "Curator\u2019s Choice: Dr. Jean-Luc Pilon\u2019s Insights Into the First Peoples Hall", "author": "Patricia Corrigan", "timestamp": "2015-07-17 00:00:00", "text": "In recognition of History Week, which ran from July 1 to 7, the Museum offered a special \u201cCurator\u2019s Choice\u201d program so visitors could learn more about the past through several curated \u201cmini-tours\u201d highlighting some of the Museum\u2019s most significant objects and spaces.\nDr. Jean-Luc Pilon discussing some of the most significant objects and spaces found in the First Peoples Hall\nDr. Jean-Luc Pilon, Curator, Central Archaeology, led a tour of the First Peoples Hall, which celebrates the diversity, creativity, resourcefulness and endurance of Canada\u2019s First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit peoples.\nDr. Pilon was part of the team that developed the First Peoples Hall. He is therefore ideally positioned to provide exclusive insights into the Museum\u2019s approach to presenting an exhibition that demonstrates the cultural richness of Canada\u2019s First Peoples.\nIn his talk, Dr. Pilon spoke about the four \u201cpillars\u201d that informed the Museum\u2019s concept for the First Peoples Hall. One of these pillars is \u201cFirst Peoples\u2019 ancient and ongoing relationship with the land,\u201d which Dr. Pilon explained by discussing some of the artifacts found in the module on Arctic whalers.\nThis is a home constructed from the skeleton of a bowhead whale. It very different from the housing that is typically associated with Canada\u2019s North, namely igloos or snow houses. In fact, most Inuit did not live in snow houses. In summer, the majority of people lived in skin tents and, in the winter, they lived in houses framed in driftwood or whalebone.\nIn this module, visitors can see a house constructed from the skeleton of a bowhead whale. The whale\u2019s skeleton provided an ideal structure for a family home. The skull of the whale was used at the entranceway, above the low cold trap which kept the cold air away from the living space and helped insulate the house\u2019s interior. The people who lived in these homes would enter through the whale\u2019s skull into a shelter made of the whale\u2019s skeleton, which enabled them to enjoy comfort, warmth and family life. They literally lived inside a whale.\nConsider, though, the difficult work involved in acquiring a whale for food and building materials. Bowhead whales are by no means small. As Dr. Pilon asked the group of visitors: how would you hunt a 40 tonne animal?\nThe Arctic inhabitants who hunted this massive animal believed it would sacrifice itself to them only if they satisfied the soul of the animal. There was, consequently, deep respect and reverence for these animals. The Inuit who hunted them believed in giving back to an animal that gave itself to be killed.\nThis ceremonial bucket is made out of baleen and decorated with carved ivory whale symbols. Baleen is the tough bristle-like feeder system found in the mouths of whales that feed on plankton.\nAmong the numerous artifacts in the Arctic whalers module that demonstrates this deep reverence is a ceremonial bucket made out of baleen and decorated with whale symbols carved from walrus ivory. Because whales live in salt water, the Inuit believed they were always thirsty. Therefore, after capturing the whale, the Inuit would fill the baleen pail with fresh water and give it to the whale to drink as it was brought ashore. They gave the whale the gift of its first taste of sweet, fresh water to recognize the whale\u2019s sacrifice and respectfully thank it so that it might give itself again.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/field-notes-updates-from-the-shishalh-archaeological-research-project/", "category": "Museum Research", "title": "Field Notes: Updates from the sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh Archaeological Research Project", "author": "Terence Clark", "timestamp": "2015-07-10 00:00:00", "text": "Well, it\u2019s been awhile.

It\u2019s from my very first dig: a field school with the University of Victoria, taught by Don Mitchell and Becky Wigen in 1994. The t-shirt is older than most members of my crew this summer.\nWe kept finding examples of an artifact called a pi\u00e8ce esquill\u00e9e, which is a bipolar stone flake. We had trouble pronouncing the name, so we called them a pi\u00e8ce qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est (a piece \u2014 what is it?). That nerdy inside joke was immortalized here, on our dig t-shirts. Photo: T. Clark\nWe were at Kosapsom, DcRu 4, in Victoria, BC. The site was the historic Craigflower Schoolhouse, located along the Gorge Waterway. Under the schoolhouse were 4,000 years of Coast Salish culture. Up until that point, I was unsure where my career would take me. After spending a few weeks finding artifacts that hadn\u2019t seen the light of day in thousands of years, I was hooked. Since that field school, for all but 3 of the last 21 years, I have spent each summer digging into the history of British Columbia, one trowelful at a time. Maybe some of our students will be inspired the same way this summer.\nOld Craigflower Schoolhouse at Kosapsom. Photo: Bruce Pollock, WikiCommons\nOver the past two decades, I have had the pleasure to work all across British Columbia, seeing some amazing sites and meeting some wonderful people. From the aptly named Horsefly Lake and Fubar Glacier, to some sketchy landings in floatplanes and helicopters, to the unrelenting blackflies of Kispiox, each new project brought something new and exciting. I can still remember seeing a Kermode bear cub (spirit bear) wandering along the side of the road near Lava Lake on the Nisga\u2019a Highway. I can also remember spraying bear spray at a curious black bear that was a little too close for comfort near Williams Lake. The bear didn\u2019t even sneeze \u2014 but it also didn\u2019t eat me, so I can\u2019t complain. I vividly recall why you need to watch where you sit in prickly-pear cactus territory near Kamloops. And I still think about the slow tugboat ride through the fog each morning to the site on Pender Island, with a crew from the Tseycum, Tsartlip and Tsawout First Nations.\nMy fondest memories are of the great people I have had the privilege of working with. A series of projects brought me into Qualicum territory, and I worked closely with Kwaksistala Chief Adam Dick and Chief Kim Recalma-Clutesi. They were so generous with their time, knowledge and friendship. I was also honoured to take part in the reburial ceremony of Qualicum/Pentlatch ancestors at Deep Bay.\nI worked for years in the Central Interior of British Columbia as well, with the Williams Lake and Soda Creek First Nations. I learned a lot about archaeology and the land from great people like Leo Michel and Glen Dixon, not to mention top-notch archaeologists Darcy Mathews and Nicole Nicholls.\nWithout a doubt, though, the Sechelt project has been my favourite. The project has it all: great people, a great location and great archaeology. The Sunshine Coast feels like home.\nSechelt Inlet from a floatplane. Photo: N. Leclerc.\nThe project was started in 2009 by Gary Coupland of the University of Toronto, and I joined the project as director in 2011.

Growing every year, we have added a training program for sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh youth, which we ran in 2012 and 2013, and we are happy to do again this year. We also held sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh Archaeology Day, where we showed our findings to the community and encouraged our students to take the lead in explaining their culture to their community. We will hold our third sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh Archaeology Day this July, and I hope it\u2019s bigger and better than ever.

Canadian Museum of History, Edwin Lester Brittain Fonds, H-153\nHockey began as an outdoor game. Quintessentially Canadian, pond hockey has lost none of its appeal. Few objects speak more eloquently about the history of our national sport than this artifact: the oldest known hockey stick. It was made in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, in the 1830s, for a boy named William \u201cDilly\u201d Moffatt (b. 1829). His initials are carved into the blade of the stick. Testing has determined that the wood used to make this stick is similar in composition to living sugar maple trees in the area around the Moffatt homestead, thereby effectively proving that the stick was crafted in that region. An analysis of the ring count on the stick suggests it was cut in between 1835 and 1838. This evidence is consistent with the oral history of the stick, recounted over generations, of games of ice hockey on the local frozen pond.\nHurley-hockey stick, 1835\u20131838, belonged to W. M.

By the late 19th century, the Mi\u2019kmaq were recognized as the best hockey stick makers and, when sticks began to be produced in factories, the Starr Manufacturing Company hired Mi\u2019kmaq employees and named their sticks \u201cMicMac\u201d as a nod to this history.\nCurling stone, mid-1800s. Canadian Museum of History 2009.71.1995\nCurling has a history closely linked to the settlement of this country. Invented in Europe and popularized in Scotland in the 16th century, curling travelled across the ocean with Scottish immigrants. It quickly became a very popular pastime for settlers and soldiers alike, as it was particularly suited to the climate of British North America. Sponsored by high-ranking government officials, the sport had patronage and prizes. The first curling club in British North America, the Royal Montreal Curling Club, was founded in 1807.\u00a0 It was followed in the 1820s by the formation of clubs in Kingston, Qu\u00e9bec City and Halifax, but the sport really took off in the 1830s. Montreal was the home of the first indoor rink in Canada, and the first book on curling was written in Toronto in 1840. Seen to be a democratic sport, where all nationalities and ranks could mingle, curling was proclaimed in newspaper accounts as having become more Canadian than Scottish! By the beginning of the 20th century, the best club in Canada was the Winnipeg Granite Club, and women\u2019s clubs were opening across the country. Today Canadians are strong curlers, consistently competing at the highest levels in men\u2019s, women\u2019s and wheelchair events. Statistics show that curling is both a popular participatory and spectator sport.\nWomen curling, around 1900. Canadian Museum of History Archives, S2004-1017 LS\nFun fact: Although the earliest curling stones may in fact have been rocks, Scottish soldiers stationed in Canada were known to use iron stones, possibly melted from ammunition. In the middle of the 19th century, some curlers used stones made of burled wood and iron. By the middle of the 20th century, Canadian curlers had settled on granite stones.\nEarly golf clubs, around 1900, stamped J.H. Oke and Wm. Park. Canadian Museum of History 995.4.6; 994.6.56; 996.3.31\nLike curling, golf was introduced to Canada by Scottish immigrants in the early 1800s, but only became more popular as a leisure pursuit at the beginning of the 20th century. By then, the tools of golf had changed, and women were also playing the game. J.H. Oke and William Park are closely associated with the history of the Royal Ottawa Golf Course: Oke was the first golf professional there, and Park designed the course. In addition, John H. Oke won the first-ever Canadian Open Championship in 1904. In those days, irons were stamped with the name of the professional golfer, a mark to indicate quality and craftsmanship. These irons could strike the newly invented rubber-core golf balls to better effect and more competitive finishes.\nEarly rubber-core golf ball, 1901.

Canadian Museum of History, Phlippe Beaudry Collection, 2012-H0018.20\nThe sinking of the Empress of Ireland in May 1914 was a powerful demonstration of the hazards of navigating the St. Lawrence River. It served as a reminder that knowledgeable hands were needed behind the helm as ships entered and exited from what was then Canada\u2019s busiest waterway.\nBy the turn of the 20th century, there were about 70 pilots steering ships along the St. Lawrence, below Qu\u00e9bec City. Their task was complicated by the vagaries of weather, climate and fog, and the very nature of the river itself, which narrows progressively as you move upstream. Mariners also had to beware of the series of islands out in the channel from\u00a0 l\u2019Ile Verte and l\u2019Ile au Li\u00e8vres to l\u2019Ile d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans. During the 1913 navigation season, three pilots were suspended for mishaps that involved the ships they guided, including the CPR steamer, S.S. Lake Manitoba.\nWith the increasing number of accidents, likely caused by the rise in traffic, the pilots came under fire in the press and throughout shipping and business circles. The Montr\u00e9al Board of Trade felt that the incompetency of the river pilots was the cause of the mounting number of mishaps on the St Lawrence. They pointed to the rise in marine insurance premiums. A Royal Commission, convened in 1913, called for the abolition of the Corporation of Pilots and the tour-de-r\u00f4le system (where pilots took charge of vessels in turns and pooled their wages), a reduction in the number of pilots and the immediate dismissal of the superintendent of the Montr\u00e9al channel pilots, a man viewed as unfit for the job. The Commission pointedly remarked that the pilot office in Qu\u00e9bec City was upstairs from a bar \u201chaving a door leading directly into that place\u201d and urged that the office be closed down immediately.\nThe pilots were unwilling to accept recommendations from an investigative body that they viewed as a puppet of the Shipping Federation. They felt that they were being unfairly blamed for the increase in shipping accidents and said so in their minority report to the Royal Commission. \u201cEveryone has in mind the mishap of the S.S. Helvetia, sunk by the Empress of Britain,\u201d they stated. \u201cWho does not remember the S.S. Titanic? These vessels were not handled by pilots when they met their sad fate.\u201d Moreover, they felt that the Department of Marine and Fisheries, which had recently taken over the administration of the pilots, was treating them with disrespect, forcing them to take a navigation test a day before the opening of season in 1906 and asking them to pass exams in English when most of them were French-speaking. The pilots took particular exception to a comment from one of the Commission members that their job was easy; so easy they could smoke their pipe as they headed for work. They responded by saying, \u201cWe would like to have him smoking with us when we are tossed in the S.S. Eureka at Father Point during stormy weather. We think he would soon find our tobacco too strong for him.\u201d\nPilots worked out of Pointe-au-P\u00e8re and Qu\u00e9bec City, attaching themselves to the local society for the duration of the navigation season. Some worked on the tour-de-r\u00f4le basis; others were attached to a shipping line such as the CPR or the Allan Line. The Dominion Coal Company used nine regular pilots on its vessels. In some instances, outbound colliers did not even bother to leave off their pilots at Pointe-au-P\u00e8re. These pilots remained aboard until the ships reached their destination, usually Sydney, Nova Scotia, the main harbour for shipping out Cape Breton coal. Charles Clavet, a pilot with 25 years of experience, lost his life when the ship he was on, the S.S. Bridgeport, went down shortly after leaving Sydney harbour in November 1913. Clavet should not have been aboard; he should have disembarked at Pointe-au-P\u00e8re.\nWhen the pilot station was moved to Pointe-au-P\u00e8re in 1905, it was subsequently outfitted with a new lighthouse, pier, wireless telegraphy station, rescue equipment and a machine-powered fog horn. The old McWilliams schooner was no longer used. A new pilot boat was pressed into service. Built in Glasgow in 1893, the S.S. Eureka was a converted coal-powered tug, 94 feet (almost 30 metres) in length. The Eureka was not the best of vessels when the weather was rough. The Pilots recommended acquiring a larger, more seaworthy vessel, equipped with wireless radio telegraphy and searchlights for night work, and with room enough to clothe and feed pilots so they would not have to pay room and board ashore.\nMap of the St. Lawrence shoreline showing the old Bic Harbour in the lower left and Pointe-au-P\u00e8re (Father Point) in the top right corner. Photo by Steven Darby, Canadian Museum of History, after an original from the collections of the Mus\u00e9e maritime du Qu\u00e9bec.\nOn board the Eureka was a man no doubt familiar to the pilots: Captain Jean-Baptiste B\u00e9langer, a native of L\u2019Anse-\u00e0-Gilles, near L\u2019Islet-sur-Mer, and an experienced navigator. It was B\u00e9langer who was first on the scene after the Empress of Ireland went down early in the morning of May 29, 1914, his lifeboats lowered and at the ready. He saved dozens of lives that morning. B\u00e9langer eventually testified at the Commission of Inquiry following the Empress disaster. The story of his exploits was handed down through his family for generations.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/expanding-on-the-empress-part-1-pilots-of-pointe-au-pere/", "category": "Museum Research", "title": "Expanding on The Empress Part 1: The Pilots of Pointe-au-P\u00e8re", "author": "John Willis", "timestamp": "2015-06-23 00:00:00", "text": "Model of pilot boat from Pointe-au-P\u00e8re. Canadian Museum of History, 2014.0014.0043.1. This boat operated between the shore at Pointe-au-P\u00e8re and the ships out in the channel. Beginning in 1960, the pilot station was moved to the north shore community of Les Escoumins, where to this day pilots are still taken on and off the passing vessels.\nThe old pilot schooner\nThis model of a schooner (go\u00e9lette) was acquired from the Mus\u00e9e des bateaux miniatures of Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup in 2012. It depicts the wind-powered schooner (also equipped with a motor) that was used to carry pilots back and forth from the ships entering and leaving the St. Lawrence River at Pointe-au-P\u00e8re during the late 19th century. Measuring 28 centimetres high and about 29 centimetres long, this wood-carved object tells an interesting story of a place, Pointe-au-P\u00e8re, and of a community of pilots that, for three centuries or more, have worked the boats plying the waters of the St. Lawrence River. These pilots fulfilled the essential service of safely steering vessels up or down a hazardous and very busy waterway.\nThe model represents the first pilot boat at Pointe-au-P\u00e8re. That boat belonged to John McWilliams, who became the local lighthouse keeper in 1876. As a sideline, he built a boat to carry pilots to and from the ships that navigated the river. The initiative may have been a joint venture involving McWilliams himself and Peter Rouleau, the harbour master for Pointe-au-P\u00e8re and Rimouski. The service was introduced decades before Pointe-au-P\u00e8re was officially chosen as the main lower St. Lawrence pilot station in 1905, succeeding the older pilot station of Le Bic.\nPointe-au-P\u00e8re is located 30 kilometres downstream from Le Bic, a pilot station on the lower St. Lawrence that had existed since the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Some pilots went to Pointe-au-P\u00e8re instead of Le Bic beginning in 1859, when the Montreal Ocean Steamship Company \u2014 or the Allan Line as it was known \u2014 began using Pointe-au-P\u00e8re as the base for its pilots during the navigation season. The Allan Line had recently introduced a weekly mail service between Canada and Europe, and built new ships specifically for this purpose. A lighthouse was erected at Pointe-au-P\u00e8re to minimize the risks to shipping on the St. Lawrence. A number of other lighthouses were built upriver, notably on the Pilgrim Islands and the Kamouraska Islands during the 1860s, at the insistence of shipping companies and the Qu\u00e9bec City Chambre de commerce. The Allan lighthouse was eventually taken over by the federal government. The lighthouse burned down in 1867 but was rebuilt later the same year. It was equipped with a fog gun to help orient ships as they navigated up and down the river.\nIn 1876, McWilliams became the second lighthouse keeper at Pointe-au-P\u00e8re. He was 21 years of age at the time. Pilots appreciated the convenience his schooner offered by ferrying them back and forth from the ships. There was no pier at Pointe-au-P\u00e8re, so pilots were likely picked up or left off by a jolly boat. Although perilous in rough weather, they may have found McWilliams\u2019s schooner more convenient than the vessel maintained by the Corporation of St. Lawrence Pilots at Le Bic. If the tide permitted, the Corporation\u2019s craft would exit the Bic River and surrounding bay and sail around Biquette Island before reaching open water. The other option was for the boat to remain out in the open water, at all times making it vulnerable to inclement weather or, in cases of dense fog, possible collision with other vessels. Access to vessels from Pointe-au-Pere, on the other hand, was more direct: they were right in the channel just beyond the shore. It was easier to come and go and not lose sight of the ships in need of a pilot.\nJohn McWilliams left his mark on the community of Pointe-au-P\u00e8re, serving as mayor during the 1890s and 1900s. He retired from lighthouse work in 1911. In the manuscript census for that year, he is described as a 55-year-old lighthouse keeper and a t\u00e9l\u00e9graphiste of Scottish descent and Anglican religion living with his niece and two servants. His son David, a mechanic and telegraph operator, wife Nora and their 1-year-old son lived next door. John McWilliams died in 1921, and was buried in the Anglican cemetery of Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup,\nBy 1914, Pointe-au-P\u00e8re had become a hamlet of navigators, wireless operators, lighthouse keepers, sailors, farmers and seasonal workers numbering about 70 families. Life revolved around the seasonal contours of the navigation business. Many in Pointe-au-P\u00e8re held two jobs: one somehow associated with maritime navigation in summer and another, perhaps inland, in winter. These people lived, worked and socialized together.\nOn May 26, 1914, two days before the Empress of Ireland left Qu\u00e9bec City on its fateful journey, a reception was held to honour the marriage of Willie Goulet, a sailor and part-time lumberjack, to Anne Lagac\u00e9, both residents of Pointe-au-P\u00e8re. Goulet, aged 22, was the eldest born of Walston Goulet and Eug\u00e9nie Poirier. Anne, 6 years older, had been a servant in the household of Pierre Ross, navigateur. The wedding party was a moment of pure celebration, but it also offered a chance for members of the local community to bond together. How could they know that disaster would strike just 48 hours later?\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/video-the-magna-carta-at-the-canadian-museum-of-history/", "category": "Significant Dates", "title": "Video: The Magna Carta at the Canadian Museum of History", "author": "\u00c9liane Laberge", "timestamp": "2015-06-19 00:00:00", "text": "The Museum has just opened its newest special exhibition, Magna Carta \u2013 Law, Liberty and Legacy, which gives Canadians a rare opportunity to view one of the most significant historical documents in the world, the Magna Carta, and its companion document, the Charter of the Forest.\nIn the video below, Canon Rosalind Brown, Canon Librarian from Durham Cathedral, explains the context behind the Magna Carta to show how it and the Charter of the Forest laid the foundation for the fundamental principles of modern democratic life that many of us take for granted today.\n\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/photo-of-the-week-2015-06-14/", "category": "Photo of the Week", "title": "Photo Of The Week \u2013 2015-06-14", "author": "", "timestamp": "2015-06-17 00:00:00", "text": "\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/meet-paddle-who-came-to-live-at-the-canadian-museum-of-history-in-2010/", "category": "Museum Research", "title": "Meet Paddle, Who Came to Live at the Canadian Museum of History in 2010", "author": "Jennifer Anderson", "timestamp": "2015-06-12 00:00:00", "text": "Paddle, a wooden carving made by Bill Mason. Canadian Museum of History, 2010.44.1, IMG2010-0206-0035-Dm\nYou may have already met Paddle, possibly on a 1970s TV screen at primary school or, more recently, online.\nPaddle is the main character from the children\u2019s book published by Holling C. Holling in 1941, as well as the Oscar-nominated film Paddle to the Sea, produced by Bill Mason for the National Film Board in 1966. In addition to gracing the silver screen, a giant Paddle can be seen in Paddle-to-the-Sea Park in Nipigon, Ontario.\nPaddle to the Sea is primarily a tale of inter-cultural understanding, and the ways in which humans are connected across time and space. It is an allegory: a story about the connections between a small community north of Lake Superior and the rest of the world; a story about the connections between an Ojibwe boy living in that community and people encountered on Paddle\u2019s journey to the sea; and a tale of adversity, adventure and arrival.\nBill Mason was an award-winning filmmaker. His films were twice nominated for Academy Awards, and he won four Canadian and innumerable international film awards. Mason is also a household name in canoeing circles. Good timing, talent and some old-fashioned pluck thrust Mason to the forefront of the recreational adventure-canoeing trend, which took off in Canada in the 1970s. His instructional videos and books were snapped up by a public eager for the thrill of back-country canoeing. Most memorable for me is Song of the Paddle, which depicts Mason\u2019s entire family on a camping-canoe adventure. Another film you may remember \u2014 Cry of the Wild (1972), a feature film about the lives of wolves \u2014made a splash at the box office.\nIn 2010, when Paddle joined the Museum\u2019s collection, a number of other artifacts related to Bill Mason\u2019s career were also acquired. These included the outfits worn by the Masons to attend the Academy Awards in Hollywood and one of their famous red canoes \u2014 the one Mason called a Pal, but which is actually a Chestnut Deer.\nA 16-foot Chestnut Deer cedar-strip canoe, once owned by the Mason family. Canadian Museum of History, 2010.139.1, IMG2011-0348-0009-Dm\nThe 16-foot cedar-strip, canvas and fibreglass canoe belonging to Bill Mason is not in pristine condition. It clearly shows the wear-and-tear of years of adventure canoeing, and tells that story in scratches and patches. We would not want it any other way.

Canadian Museum of History, 2010.7.10, IMG2011-0181-0145-Dm\nClothing and accoutrements used by Bill Mason and his family in canoeing, filmmaking and art have also been acquired by the Museum. Together, these artifacts allow the Museum to document the making of an icon.\nYou can see Bill Mason wearing this red checked shirt from the National Collection in this clip: https://www.nfb.ca/film/path_of_the_paddle_doubles_basic/. Canadian Museum of History, 2010.7.2, IMG2011-0335-0015-Dm\nAlthough the films were produced by Bill, his films were a team effort, and frequently featured his wife Joyce and his children, Becky and Paul. In 1978, Bill Mason and the National Film Board released Song of the Paddle, an adventure tale about a family canoe-camping trip, which became an inspiration for many Canadian families. In the film, you can see him playing the guitar below at the campfire.\nBill Mason plays this guitar in the film Song of the Paddle. Canadian Museum of History, 2010.7.26, IMG2011-0181-0005-Dm\nIn Canoe Nation (2013), Bruce Erikson identifies Bill Mason as influential in the making of a Canadian myth. James Raffan, Mason\u2019s biographer, suggests that Mason was an emerging wilderness filmmaker at a time when canoeing was being (re-)invented as a popular pastime in North America, and the do-it-yourself, naturalist messages in his films appealed to a ready audience. The iconography in Mason\u2019s films was informed by his faith, his rapport with nature, an imagined channelling of First Nations voices and a sense of adventure. In this, Mason\u2019s story brings to mind other iconic Canadians who have tapped into this imagery, including Tom Thomson, Grey Owl and Farley Mowat.\nFilms were not the only form of art in which Bill Mason engaged. He was also a painter, a\u00a0writer and a photographer. You can see Bill Mason\u2019s palette in use in Waterwalker (at the 8-minute mark). Canadian Museum of History, 2010.7.42.2, IMG2011-0224-0083-Dm\nMason\u2019s legacy has not faded with time. The image of the bearded man in the red canoe, taking his family on a rustic canoe trip, continues to capture the imagination of modern canoe and nature enthusiasts. If the canoe nation is an imagined identity, it is a persuasive one.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/large-artifact-small-space-reassembling-namaxsala-a-task-requiring-precision-and-patience/", "category": "Collections Management", "title": "Large Artifact, Small Space: Reassembling \u2018namaxsala, a Task Requiring Precision and Patience", "author": "John Staunton", "timestamp": "2015-06-10 00:00:00", "text": "Mary Anne Barkhouse\u2019s sculpture \u2018namaxsala (To Travel in a Boat Together), is a striking work of art. Fittingly, it is displayed in one of the outdoor pools adjacent to the Grand Hall, the Museum\u2019s exhibition on the history, cultures and beliefs of the First Peoples of Canada\u2019s Pacific Coast. The sculpture takes the form of a large canoe, about 5 metres in length. It is made of copper sheet and stainless steel supports, and is somewhat fragile. The central part of the sculpture, the wolf, is a separate component that is mounted atop a granite and concrete column in the stern of the canoe. The canoe mount consists of a poured concrete base that sits among the river rock at the bottom of the pool.\nWe removed the canoe in late 2014 to attend to a minor issue involving the point of attachment of the legs to the canoe sides. The wolf, being a separate component, remained in situ over the winter awaiting the return of the canoe. In this blog post I\u2019ll explain how we reunited the canoe and the wolf earlier this spring. In the image below, you can see the legs and supports at the stern and middle of the canoe, with lifting straps attached. The weight of the copper sides is borne by these two crosspieces, as well as a third one at the bow. During the lift, the load had to be distributed as equally as possible between these points to avoid stressing or deforming the copper. The lift also had to be done from directly overhead.\nThe stern and middle supports, with lifting straps attached.\nI used a 3-metre lifting beam to ensure the safety of the artifact. In the image below, you can see two of us working on attaching a single lifting strap, running from the stern through a shackle directly above, through a second shackle and down to the middle support. This single strap allowed the weight of the canoe to be evenly distributed during the lift. At this stage, I signalled the boom operator to raise the beam, which put slight tension on the strap. We then attached a third adjustable strap to the bow mount. It was now a relatively simple matter to ensure the same amount of tension on each strap. The entire unit was then raised and swung into position over the mount.\nPreparing to reinstall the canoe portion of the sculpture.\nNow for the hard part! The wolf fits tightly in the stern, with just over 1 cm of clearance between the stone base and the sides of the canoe. This meant that we needed to get the canoe perfectly aligned above the mount and wolf before we started to lower it. To do this as safely as possible, protecting both wolf and canoe, I wrapped the wolf in quilted padding. Once we lowered the canoe past the wolf, we needed to settle it evenly on the bolts securing the legs to the mount. We didn\u2019t want one end to seat itself, while the other got hung up on the protruding bolts, as that might have caused the copper to buckle. Once the operation was completed successfully, we removed the straps, secured the canoe to the mount and refilled the pool with water. The canoe and wolf were now reunited.\n\u2018namaxsala (To Travel in a Boat Together) by Mary Anne Barkhouse\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/an-insiders-perspective-finding-inspiration-in-an-ancient-greek-city/", "category": "Behind the Scenes", "title": "An Insider\u2019s Perspective: Finding Inspiration in an Ancient Greek City", "author": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9ger", "timestamp": "2015-06-05 00:00:00", "text": "Mycenae\u2019s Grave Circle A and Lion Gate (upper right).\nPhoto: Andreas Trepte/Wikimedia Commons\nSome of the things we experience in life have the power to change us forever.

The Museum is proud to be working on this transformation with Douglas Cardinal, the Lead Architect for the Canadian History Hall.\nArchitect, designer, planner, activist, philosopher, artist \u2014 Douglas Cardinal is that and more. His life is dedicated to creating beautiful, thriving, harmonious built environments. As an architect he builds buildings; as a planner and activist he builds communities; as a leader and philosopher he builds bridges between dispersed cultures all over the world. Douglas Cardinal personifies the timelessness of a masterbuilder.\nDouglas Cardinal was born in Calgary, Alberta in 1934. The son of a game warden, he studied architecture at the University of British Columbia and the University of Texas, graduating with honours in 1963. He practised in Edmonton for 18 years and then moved his practice to Ottawa in 1984.\nThe Museum recently sat down with Douglas Cardinal to discuss his role in the project. Read below to see what he has to say.\nDouglas Cardinal with his wife, Idoia, at an event held at the Canadian Museum of History last June to celebrate his 80th birthday.\nMuseum: The Canadian History Hall is the most important project the Museum has undertaken since the construction of its current buildings, 25 years ago. What is your role in this project?\nCardinal: My role in the development of the Canadian History Hall is that of Lead Architect. As such, it is my responsibility to develop the architectural concept of the hall and to coordinate the architectural, mechanical, electrical and structural engineering disciplines as well as the code consultants.\nI will also integrate the concepts of the Museum\u2019s professionals as well as the themes and visions of the exhibition\u2019s designers, who are expressing a new and exciting narrative of the history of Canada, created by Museum scholars with the advice of experts from across the nation.\nMuseum: What will the Canadian History Hall offer its visitors? Why is it important?\nCardinal: In the past, Canadian history was seen as starting after European contact with Canada\u2019s Indigenous Peoples. The revised scholarly narrative of Canadian history will start with the First Peoples inhabiting the land following the last Ice Age 10\u201315,000 years ago. It will start with the cultures that thrived on this land for thousands of years and will illustrate their history and culture, which grew out of our Canadian landscape. It will describe their contribution and the changes to their way of life after European contact.\nIt will show how the French and the English relationship with the land and with the Indigenous Peoples shaped and reshaped our whole Canadian society, as well as the many people that came from countries around the world, who also shaped our destiny and have made a great contribution in shaping this country, where multiculturalism thrives. Indeed, respect and tolerance is something we share as Canadians.\nCanada\u2019s story is important to other nations of the world because it sets a fine example of how people of different races, creeds and cultures can thrive together in diversity and produce a culture of dignity and respect for all of its citizens.\nMuseum: How does this project connect with your initial vision for the Museum?\nCardinal: Originally called the \u201cNational Museum of Man,\u201d the Museum was designed as an organic expression of architecture evolving around its functions and showcasing the history of the cultures that created our nation. The Museum is a dynamic sculpture inspired by the powerful Canadian landscape, sculpted by wind and water. The building embraces the Ottawa River and the majestic view of Parliament.\nThe History Hall is designed to emphasize the openness of our people and the vast space of the land we call Canada. It opens to all the halls in the Museum, for cross-referencing, to emphasize the vast space of the Canadian territory and the open relationships we share across our land. We designed the hall to have natural light. The Canadian History Hall will take full advantage of the original architectural design of the building, including the view, which honours Parliament Hill. The mezzanine will symbolically flow in sweeping forms like the Ottawa River into an oval ramp, symbolizing the natural phenomena of the \u201cGreat Kettle\u201d (Chaudi\u00e8re Falls), which Indigenous People saw as a power centre for the Nations. It has since become the power centre for all Canadians as the nation\u2019s capital. This strong symbolic form in the Canadian History Hall will be the backbone and the hub, presenting our whole history as a nation, expressed by the existing architectural forms.\nMuseum: You have said before that the \u201cMuseum building itself is an artifact of its time.\u201d Why is that?\nCardinal: The Museum was conceived as a work of art. As such, we are required to preserve its artistic integrity as a sculptural representation of the people of Canada and the dramatic landscape they inhabit. The Museum itself and its shape aspired to be a symbol of an evolving organic nationhood, to enshrine the diverse cultures of Canada. It has been recognized as a Canadian icon, receiving national and international recognition.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/a-witness-of-the-winnipeg-general-strike-in-1919/", "category": "Spotlight on the National Collection", "title": "A Witness of the Winnipeg General Strike in 1919", "author": "Anderson-Trepanier-Willis", "timestamp": "2015-05-15 00:00:00", "text": "One brown wooden billy club used in the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919.

They braved the rough seas of the harsh North Atlantic to reach distant Kodlunarn Island, and other locales around what is now Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island. They toiled under difficult conditions to extract and amass the tons of ore they hoped would bring great wealth and profit to Frobisher and to powerful financial backers that included Elizabeth I. Plans were even conceived to have miners overwinter, so that they could stockpile more of the \u201cblack ore.\u201d On the dangerous voyage back to England, heavily laden ships brought the precious ore to Dartford, south of London, where a smelter had been specially constructed to coax a wealth of gold and silver from the stone. Their excitement soon turned to bitter disappointment, however, when assays proved the ore to be worthless.\nSo what to do with more than 1,350 tons (1,136 tons in 1578 alone) of Arctic rock? Much of the now contemptible stone was used locally inside rubble walls. Some was used in the building of the western wall that still surrounds part of the Manor House site in Dartford, which was formerly used by Henry VIII.\nArtifacts directly related to Frobisher\u2019s venture in the Canadian Arctic include small fragments of pottery, bits of brick, shreds of basketry and even carbonized peas. While these all bear witness to the determination of Frobisher and his men, they are hardly impressive.\nPeas brought by Frobisher and his men to Baffin Island.\nIt was with this in mind that I emailed the Dartford Borough Museum, asking whether one of Frobisher\u2019s stones might be available for transfer to the Canadian Museum of History for possible inclusion in its new Canadian History Hall. The response from the Dartford Museum\u2019s curator, Dr. Mike Still, was positive and immediate. He eventually identified a sizable piece of \u201cblack ore\u201d that had been found in 1982, during archaeological testing of the Manor House site. The provenance was good, and there was little doubt as to the nature of the stone.\nThe Frobisher stone returns home to Canada more than 400 years after it was mined by Frobisher and his men.\nThanks to Dr. Still\u2019s diligence, permission to transfer the stone was obtained from Terry Young. Mr.\u00a0Young is general manager of a company that is part of J & E Hall Ltd., which occupied the Manor House from 1785 until the early 21st century.\nThe Frobisher stone and packaging material used during its journey home to Canada.\nAs this piece of Canadian stone made its way home, the FedEx online tracking service provided a minute-by-minute account of its travels from Dartford to the Canadian Museum of History, via Memphis, Tennessee and Cheektowaga, New York. The first time this stone crossed the ocean, it spent weeks in the hold of a wooden ship. This time it took hours in the cargo hold of a jet plane.

As I look back, there are some notable achievements that all Canadians should be proud of:\nWelcoming almost five million people\nWhen we were planning for the opening of the Canadian War Museum on LeBreton Flats, we originally expected to draw 250,000 visitors each year. But in our first year, the War Museum attendance figures doubled our projections: we welcomed 500,000 visitors. And every year since then, we have surpassed the target of 250,000 visitors.\nBuilding international partnerships\nPartnerships have enabled the War Museum to collaborate and consult with professionals from many different countries, to develop exhibitions about the Canadian impact in international conflicts and to bring invaluable artifacts to Canadian audiences. A highlight of the recent special exhibition Fighting in Flanders \u2013 Gas. Mud. Memory. was the iconic Menin Gate Lions, which once flanked the Menin Gate in Ypres, and which were on loan from the Australian War Memorial. Thousands of Allied soldiers passed through the gate on their way to and from the battlefields of northwestern Belgium. Partnerships also help to bring outstanding exhibitions to Canadian audiences, such as the upcoming special exhibition Gladiators and the Colosseum \u2013 Death and Glory, which was developed by the Contemporanea Progetti and which will shed light on professional fighters in the Roman Empire.\nA Museum that is truly national in scope\nAlthough the War Museum has an established physical presence in the National Capital Region, it also connects with Canadians from across the country. At the Canadian War Museum, the three Victoria Cross medals that were awarded to the First World War residents of Winnipeg\u2019s Pine Street (later renamed Valour Road) were presented together for the first time in history. This past year, we loaned the three Valour Road medals to the Manitoba Museum for a special exhibition commemorating the role of the Winnipeg Rifles and the Queen\u2019s Own Cameron Highlanders regiments during the First World War. The War Museum \u2014 whether through its artifact loans, the exhibition partnerships that allow it to present outstanding exhibitions like New Brunswickers in Wartime, 1914\u20131946, its travelling exhibitions program, or its social media outreach \u2014 is truly national in scope and in its efforts to increase Canadians\u2019 understanding of military history, wherever in the country they may live.\nA world-class national collection\nThe Canadian War Museum\u2019s collections are among the finest military holdings in the world, comprising some 500,000 military artifacts \u2014 from rare vehicles, art and artillery to uniforms, medals and personal memoirs \u2014 all of which help to tell the story of the human experience of war from Canadian perspectives. This collection includes the prestigious Beaverbrook Collection of War Art, which is one of the top 10 collections of war art in the world, as well as 33 of the 94 Victoria Crosses that have been awarded to Canadians.\nPeople lining up outside the Canadian War Museum at the opening in 2005. Photo Canadian War Museum, 2005.\nOur community presence\nThe Canadian War Museum has become an established hub of activity in the National Capital Region by hosting or co-hosting events that range from Bluesfest, which draws almost 300,000 people, to award galas attended by hundreds of guests, to small community commemorative gatherings that involve only a few individuals. The War Museum is very proud to be so deeply embedded in our local community and is delighted to host these types of events almost every other night of the week.\nThe Friends of the Canadian War Museum\nI would be remiss if I did not highlight the ongoing contributions of the loyal supporters of the Canadian War Museum, whose efforts have been instrumental to our organization\u2019s success. Without the help of the Friends of the Canadian War Museum (FCWM), our current facility would not exist. The FCWM organized the Passing the Torch campaign and raised $16 million, making it the most successful fundraising effort by a federal cultural institution at the time.\nThese are just a few of the Canadian War Museum\u2019s achievements \u00a0over the past 10 years. Each is notable in itself, but there is so much more to come. I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize the outstanding staff at the Canadian War Museum, without whom none of these achievements would have been possible.\nIn recognition of our 10th anniversary, I would like to invite all Canadians to attend the public celebration that will be held at the Canadian War Museum on Saturday May 9, or to visit our 10th anniversary website to \u201cShare Your War Museum Story.\u201d\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/sir-john-a-macdonalds-silver-casket-a-treasure-from-the-national-collection/", "category": "1867 - Rebellion and Confederation", "title": "Sir John A.

This post will discuss the thought process and effort required to move a late-1930s three-quarter-ton Dodge Fargo pickup truck.\nEarly in our planning sessions, we identified the most logical and direct route out of the exhibition area to the freight elevator. It wasn\u2019t the same as the one provided by the twisting visitor route. We decided on a direct path through display areas, which meant that we had to identify specific exhibits we would need to remove to provide direct access. We dismantled the exhibits working backwards from the freight elevator to the opposite end of the Hall. Once the team had completed the artifact removal from these spaces, we could dismantle exhibit structures to open up our route and allow for large artifact movement. This had the added benefit of also providing a more direct and efficient route for staff working in the Hall.\nThis floor plan shows the modified route we prepared to facilitate the removal of large artifacts from the Canada Hall.\nThe Dodge was located outside the Railway Station and Grain Elevator exhibits, about midpoint in the Canada Hall. It was positioned tight against the Grain Elevator, but that posed no real problem. The uneven floor and very tight corners that had to be negotiated, however, were an issue. The floors made it problematic for staff to push the truck using our small wheeled dollies; but, to use our larger dollies, we would have had to lift the entire truck much higher to position the dollies under the axles. Although that would have made the vehicle easier to push, a heavy object with a much higher centre of gravity on an uneven surface was a situation we wanted to avoid.\nPhotograph of the turntable constructed to remove the Dodge Fargo from the Canada Hall. Canadian Museum of History, photo: Steven Darby.\nThere was an alternative. We have a motorized pallet lifter capable of raising and travelling with up to 2200\u00a0kilograms. That provided more than enough lift, as well as measured controllable motive power; on its own, however, the lifter lacked the agility we needed to make the tight corners. We needed to allow the lifter to pivot while lifting and pulling the Dodge. After some thought, I determined that the solution was to build a turntable. I constructed a device using materials and equipment we had on hand: three Hillman rollers in a frame, topped with a \u00be-inch plywood disk.\nPhotograph of the turntable constructed to remove the Dodge Fargo from the Canada Hall. Canadian Museum of History, Photo: Steven Darby.\nAs you can see in the images above, the outside rollers were placed upside-down. This allowed the plywood disk to pivot on a fixed central roller as we turned corners. Placing the turntable on the pallet lifter beneath the front axle, and placing the rear axle on dollies, allowed the unit to pivot freely enough to travel through the openings we\u2019d created to the freight elevator. This system also allowed us to keep the truck\u2019s front tires as close to the floor as possible, keeping its centre of gravity low and risk to a minimum.\nPhotograph of the Dodge Fargo pickup truck on the turntable. Canadian Museum of History, Photo: Steven Darby.\nWith Collections and Preparation staff guiding the rear end of the truck, I was able to manoeuvre it through the openings to the freight elevator and eventually to one of our larger Collections rooms.\nCollections specialists moving the Dodge Fargo pickup truck out of the Canada Hall using the modified route.

While most people consider dust an eyesore, conservators know that it is a contributing factors in the deterioration of artifacts. Consequently, ensuring that dust levels remain at or below an acceptable limit is essential to ensuring that artifacts do not have to undergo additional, potentially labour-intensive cleaning. Using a gloss meter \u2014 the Tri-Glossmaster \u2014 we can measure the \u201closs of gloss\u201d caused by dust falling onto a glass microscope slide.\nThis image shows the typical measurement setup with the Tri-Glossmaster sitting on top of the glass microscope slide.

Week 20 shows a significant increase in the measured dust level. This can be attributed to the construction of a number of walls that were designed to close off an access point for the duration of the Canadian History Hall construction project.\nDust and vibration are just two of the conservation challenges that we encounter in museums.

Demand for environmentally friendly consumer goods has dramatically increased in recent years, and \u201cgreen marketing\u201d now sells everything from light bulbs to automobiles \u2014 and soap.\u00a0 A small collection of vintage laundry-detergent boxes at the Canadian Museum of History illustrates the emergence of green marketing in Canada in the early 1970s. Then, as now, consumer preferences and government regulations influenced how producers advertised their wares. These boxes also underline how the decisions made by curators years ago have helped to make our collection relevant today. In the years of prosperity that followed the Second World War, automatic washing machines became common in Canadian households, as did synthetic detergents. These detergents used chemicals to produce suds. In the heated competition between detergent makers, producing more suds was a way of distinguishing a product from its competitors. Makers of \u201cChipso,\u201d for example, proudly proclaimed that their \u201cnew condensed flakes\u201d produced \u201cmore suds per cupful.\u201d\nChipso was the first laundry detergent specifically designed for automatic washing machines and dishwashers.

Moreover, phosphate \u201cbuilders,\u201d which improved the detergent\u2019s performance by softening the water, fertilized toxic algal blooms. This threatened drinking-water supplies and commercial fisheries. Manufacturers resisted regulation, but citizens demanded change. In 1970, the federal government limited the phosphate content of detergents. The fledgling, media-savvy Canadian environmental movement claimed a victory. Detergent makers quickly turned phosphate restrictions into a marketing opportunity. Where just a decade earlier soapboxes had promised superior suds, environmental responsibility became the new key selling point. A box of Crown detergent urged consumers to \u201cstop pollution\u201d by switching to Crown\u2019s \u201cno phosphate\u201d formula.\nFollowing the federal government\u2019s decision in 1970 to limit the phosphate content of detergents, detergent makers began to use environmental responsibility as a key selling point.

When the Museum presented the exhibition on Greek culture in 2008, she volunteered to engage with visitors through the Museum\u2019s Volunteer Interpreter Program.\nSince 2008, Cathy has worked on several of the Museum\u2019s exhibitions, including Tombs of Eternity: The Afterlife in Ancient Egypt, Afghanistan: Hidden Treasures, JAPAN: Tradition. Innovation., The Horse, Vodou and Canada\u2019s Titanic \u2013 The Empress of Ireland. Although that first exhibition on Greek culture remains her favourite, she also enjoyed working on Afghanistan: Hidden Treasures, where she had the opportunity to meet the Ambassador of Afghanistan to Canada.\nPhoto of Cathy Dimitriou, one of the Museum\u2019s volunteers.\nShe is now looking forward to the Museum\u2019s upcoming exhibition The Greeks \u2013 Agamemnon to Alexander the Great. \u201cI am anticipating a huge success and a great time.

These projects offer volunteers a wide range of activities in several areas, including research, archives, library services, special events, preparation of material for activities and programs at the Children\u2019s Museum, as well as mailings and administrative tasks.\nVolunteers at the Canadian Museum of History\u2019s annual volunteer recognition event.\nBetsy Mann is one of the Museum\u2019s longest-serving volunteers, with nearly 40 years\u2019 experience at our institution. We recently asked her about volunteering at the Museum. Here is what Betsy had to say:\nMuseum: Why did you first start volunteering for the Canadian Museum of History?\nBetsy: When Nancy Ruddell interviewed me in 1976 \u2013 the first year we could volunteer for school programs \u2013 I thought it was a great bargain. Free courses in history, ethnology and anthropology, in exchange for just a few hours of my time each week. I never imagined the extent of the bargain she was offering me! Over the past 39 years, my training has included presentations in history, religion, ethnology, archaeology, anthropology, museology, weather, musicology, geography, historiography, art history, mythology, contemporary Inuit sculpture and winemaking.\nMuseum: Why have you continued to volunteer for so long?\nBetsy: It\u2019s always seemed to me that I get more than I give. In addition to providing me with knowledge in various fields, the Museum also gave me skills that I could transfer to my paid employment. I gained confidence when it came to speaking in front of groups without being shy. \u00a0\u00a0Beyond gaining knowledge and skills, being a volunteer led me to people who shared my interests and my enthusiasm for learning and interaction with visitors. At the beginning, most of the other volunteers were older than me, and, over the years, their example inspired me. I truly saw that age is not an obstacle to an active and engaged life. Perhaps the greatest benefit of volunteering is the possibility that we have to inspire a spirit of giving in others.\nBetsy Mann, one of the Museum\u2019s longest-serving volunteers.\nMuseum: Do you have a favourite memory or experience from volunteering at the Museum?\nBetsy: I try to enrich the experience of visitors by encouraging them to make links between what they see in an exhibition and their own lives. For example, I once encountered a woman standing in front of a showcase in the exhibition Ancient Treasures and the Dead Sea Scrolls who shared a touching memory with me. When she was young and living in Poland, her grandfather had recited a benediction on his deathbed \u2013 the same benediction she now saw on the ancient artifact before her. It gave me chills, and I am honoured that I was there to hear her story.\nMuseum: Which exhibitions have you worked on while volunteering for the Museum? Do you have a favourite?\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/remembering-the-marathon-of-hope/", "category": "Connecting with Canadians", "title": "Remembering the Marathon of Hope", "author": "Patricia Corrigan", "timestamp": "2015-04-10 00:00:00", "text": "Last week the Canadian Museum of History unveiled its newest exhibition: Terry Fox \u2014 Running to the Heart of Canada. We were pleased to welcome Terry\u2019s family members and friends for the opening event, and to hear the candid stories they shared when reflecting on the Marathon of Hope.\nListening to these stories of Terry\u2019s struggles and triumphs makes you stop and think about the real heroism of this courageous young man who believed he could truly make a difference. No one can doubt that Terry achieved his goal. In addition to raising $23.4 million, or one dollar from every Canadian (as he had hoped), Terry\u2019s influence endures. In the 35 years since Terry took the first steps of his Marathon of Hope, the annual Terry Fox runs organized in September in cities all across this country and the world have raised some $650 million in Terry\u2019s name to support cancer research and awareness.\nTerry\u2019s story continues to resonate in the minds of Canadians who remember him for his heroism, courage, tenacity and selflessness. During the opening event for this exhibition, Dr. Sheldon Posen, curator of the exhibition, together with Claire Champ, creative development specialist, and Erin Gurski, research assistant, delivered a speech that recognized the millions of everyday Canadians who made the Marathon of Hope an overwhelming success 35 years ago and who continue to support it today. The following is an excerpt from their speech.\nTerry Fox \u2013 Running to the Heart of Canada. Photo: Gail Harvey.\nIt was Terry Fox who ran the Marathon of Hope, no one else. But on July 11, 1980, he said to a crowd gathered at Scarborough Civic Centre, \u201cWhen you\u2019re cheering and clapping for me, you\u2019re not just cheering and clapping for me, because there\u2019s so many other people involved in the run that nobody hears about.\u201d\nAs it was then, so it is now.

We wanted visitors to feel as if they were experiencing the Marathon of Hope while it unfolded, watching the growing excitement of Canadians as Terry ran from the Maritimes, through Quebec and into Ontario in the summer of 1980.\nAn early design concept for representing archival material on Terry\u2019s route across Canada.\nTo achieve these objectives, the team started in a very low-tech fashion, working with paper, scissors and pushpins to figure out how much of the story we could tell with maps. We made simple mock-ups and designs along the way. These helped us to refine our ideas and to share them with colleagues. Our designs evolved as we sought our colleagues\u2019 expertise on archival content, writing, design and programming.\nNow, these rough concepts have been transformed into an elegant exhibition, where visitors can explore Marathon of Hope events along Terry\u2019s route on five interactive touchscreen maps. I am enjoying the opportunity to see visitors discover the stories contained in these interactive maps.\nA push-pin design concept for representing archival material on Terry\u2019s route across Canada.\nAs my work on the exhibition wraps up and I tidy my files, I found photographs of the mock-ups and sketches of maps we made at the start of process.\u00a0 It is so much fun for me to compare the \u201cbefore and after,\u201d and see how our ideas progressed.\u00a0 I am happy to note that, even though our mock-ups were pretty rough at the outset, the core of our idea was there all along.\nPhoto of the interactive touchscreen map that visitors can use to explore Marathon of Hope events along Terry\u2019s route.\nIn the exhibition, discovering Terry Fox\u2019s route on these interactive maps is just part of the visitor experience. Visitors also see some very personal items that belonged to Terry: his prosthetic legs, handwritten journal, T-shirts and running shorts. These artifacts are profoundly moving because they are so intimate. They also help us show how special aspects of Terry\u2019s character made it possible for him to plan and carry out the run, especially his vision, his determination, his integrity and his courage. This mix of artifacts, images, maps and stories all work together to bring visitors closer to Terry Fox, his achievements during the Marathon of Hope and what he means to Canadians.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/dust-and-vibration-do-matter/", "category": "Canadian History Hall", "title": "Dust and Vibration Do Matter!", "author": "Rebecca Latourell", "timestamp": "2015-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "The Collections Management and Conservation team at the Canadian Museum of History is responsible for the preservation, care and treatment of the artifacts in the collection. This involves hands-on treatment to stabilize and repair artifacts, as well as preventative measures such as the monitoring and assessment of various environmental factors \u2014 including temperature, relative humidity and light, and their impact on the collection.\nThe dismantling of the Canada Hall and construction of the new Canadian History Hall poses some unique collections-care challenges, not only for the objects being removed, but also for the collections that will remain on display throughout the Museum while the new Hall is being developed.\nIn an effort to fulfill our role as caretakers of the collection, the Conservation team has been involved in preparations for construction of the Canadian History Hall. Two key areas of concern were identified in relation to the project: increased levels of dust and the possibility of construction-related vibration. Dust and vibration are everyday realities in a museum \u2014 a visitor simply walking across a gallery floor will cause some vibration. And, as everyone knows, dust is a never-ending battle, even in your own home! Introducing a construction project into the mix is bound to result in higher levels of both.\nIn September 2014, with the assistance of Paul Marcon from the Canadian Conservation Institute) and some specialized equipment borrowed from the Institute, we measured a baseline set of vibration levels in the Museum. This included vibrations caused by the movement of visitors through the galleries and by the building\u2019s mechanical systems. This baseline was then compared against measurements taken during a simulated construction-vibration test.\nPaul Marcon and Rebecca Latourell installing the Innometer.\nFollowing closure of the Museum for the day, the onsite construction company removed several small pieces of the flooring in the Canada Hall using a larger chipper. The resulting vibration levels were measured in our temporary exhibition spaces, one floor below. The idea was to see how much vibration from the work above might travel down into the artifacts on display. Excessive vibration has the potential to cause artifacts to shift in their display cases, resulting in collisions or even in artifacts falling over \u2014 all of which can result in damage.\nUsing standards developed by the mining industry, we concluded that the vibration levels we measured were quite low, suggesting that there would be minimal risk to the artifacts as a result of construction-related vibration. We have accordingly set acceptable vibration limits for the project and have ongoing monitoring in place to ensure that any new processes or equipment used during the construction process remain below those limits.\nView of the Innometer Software\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/the-canadian-museum-of-history-collects-the-evolution-of-a-flag/", "category": "Museum Research", "title": "The Canadian Museum of History Collects: The Evolution of a Flag", "author": "Kerri Davis", "timestamp": "2015-04-01 00:00:00", "text": "Haven\u2019t we all been there?

But sometimes it\u2019s not always immediately apparent which items will have historical significance in the future. This is the challenge of contemporary collecting. And yet, there are some events that are so obviously important that you know you are witnessing history in the making.\nThis envelope contained the painted flag prototypes from 1964. Canadian Museum of History, envelope containing materials used in the flag debate, photo Kerri Davis.\nIn 1966, staff at the Privy Council Office had the great forethought to realize that the physical evidence for the design process for Canada\u2019s new national flag was significant. Various concept paintings, fabric prototypes and associated documents were transferred to the National Museum of Canada (now the Canadian Museum of History) by the Privy Council. These items quietly sat on shelves for many years, waiting for their return to the spotlight.\nDuring a storage cleanup exercise in the autumn of 2013, members of the Museum\u2019s Collections Management team rediscovered this series of Canadian flag prototypes. The prototypes were in an unassuming envelope labelled \u201cMaterial used in Flag Debate.\u201d\nHistorian Dr. Forrest Pass was thrilled to study this treasure trove of vexillological history. Dr. Pass is the Museum\u2019s resident flag expert and curator of the special display, Our Flag at 50. Having access to such a collection allowed the curator to both analyze the historical context in which the items were created and to interpret their significance for a contemporary audience. There are always multiple ways to interpret artifacts and, in this case, Dr. Pass was able to shed some light on the evolution of the flag\u2019s design.\nPerhaps the most interesting item in this collection is what might very well be the first version of the Canadian flag as we now know it. It consists of a single red maple leaf with eleven points on a field of white, flanked by two vertical bands of red. Dr. Pass points out that this painted prototype \u201cis identical to the flag currently flown but for the stem of the leaf, which is cut on an angle, identifying it as a very early rendering.\u201d\nThis is the earliest-known example of the red maple leaf flag as we know it today. Note the bottom of the leaf\u2019s stem, cut at an angle. The stem was changed before approval of the final flag in December 1964. Canadian Museum of History, prototype of the maple leaf flag, photo Kerri Davis.\nBased on the handwritten notes on the back of this prototype, Dr. Pass is confident that this design dates from November 1964, just a few months before the new flag was first flown on February 15, 1965.\nThe notes on the back of this prototype design match the measurements of a cloth flag and were likely sent out for fabrication of the first cloth prototype of Canada\u2019s flag.

Thank you.\n\u2014 Terry Fox, to the people of Oshawa, July 9, 1980\nTerry Fox is a Canadian legend known around the world. Thousands of people, both nationally and internationally, take part in annual Terry Fox runs \u2014 and have been doing so for 35 years now. To date, more than $650 million has been raised for cancer research, all in the name of this incredibly selfless and courageous young man who believed in miracles.\nThis may be on our minds every September, but once finish lines have been crossed, tears have dried and heart rates have returned to normal, Terry Fox and his Marathon of Hope pass back into legend to be re-enacted again in a year\u2019s time. Life, for many, goes on.\nFor the past two years, however, the Marathon of Hope has been an integral part of my daily life. Since June 2013, I have been working as a research assistant on the Museum\u2019s upcoming exhibition, Terry Fox \u2013 Running to the Heart of Canada, which will soon open at the Museum. Working on a subject that is so uniquely entrenched in the Canadian psyche has been both more challenging and more rewarding than I could have imagined.\nTerry running through Ontario. Photo: Gail Harvey.\nWhen I first arrived on the job, I was asked to review all available footage of the Marathon of Hope. Throughout that first summer, I spent hour after hour watching Terry run, give speeches and enjoy what little downtime he had. I held my breath as Terry related the story of almost being hit by a transport truck in Nova Scotia. I grinned as he performed the opening kickoff at an Ottawa\u2013Saskatchewan football game. I laughed as he engaged his younger brother Darrell in a cake fight on his birthday. I grimaced when he lay on a stretcher and, through laboured breaths, told reporters in Thunder Bay that he had to go home for more treatment. And I cried when nurse Alison Sinson announced, in the early hours of June 28, 1981, that Terry had passed away peacefully \u2014 surrounded by those he loved. In short, I relived the Marathon of Hope daily from the comfort of my desk.\nTerry greets supporters at a rally in Nathan Phillips Square in Toronto on July 11, 1980. Photo: Gail Harvey.\nHaving been born almost a decade after the Marathon of Hope ended, most of this was completely new to me. As I watched both the speeches and the candid footage over and over again, I began to piece together the Terry that kids don\u2019t learn about in school. The Terry I was watching wasn\u2019t a legend who could be easily depicted in a film, a book or even an exhibition. He was alternately funny and serious; charming and goofy; confident and shy; ecstatic and upset; energetic and exhausted. In short: he was a real person.\nWatching the video footage raised a question: how can an exhibition possibly summarize the complexities of this young man? Should it even try? After all, he never wanted the attention to be on him as an individual \u2014 he said himself that \u201cthe only important part is that cancer can be beaten, and that the Marathon of Hope continues.\u201d\nThe answer to this dilemma was surprisingly human as well: if a team of professionals, including this research assistant, could be brought to the heights and depths of emotion when going through the raw material, why not let those same materials do the talking? As historians and researchers, we can describe the gruelling trials that Terry faced with his primitive prosthesis until we\u2019re blue in the face. Nothing, however, can compare to watching Terry huff and puff his way across the screen, or to being able to walk up to that same artificial leg, while trying to imagine running on it for 26 miles every day for 143 days.\nI\u2019ve now spent the better part of two years wading through videos, photographs, books, journals, letters, newspapers and artifacts in an attempt to get to the heart of what makes Terry Fox so legendary. It turns out that the title of the exhibition has it right: Terry Fox ran to the heart of Canada and into the hearts of Canadians, and this is why he will never be forgotten.\nTerry in front of the Marathon of Hope van somewhere between Parry Sound and Estaire Ontario.

What are museums for, after all, if not to allow people to immerse themselves in our incredible history?\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/large-artifact-small-space-the-seven-metre-canoe-video/", "category": "Behind the Scenes", "title": "Large Artifact, Small Space: The Seven Metre Canoe", "author": "John Staunton", "timestamp": "2015-03-20 00:00:00", "text": "Every day for the past six months or so, I\u2019ve travelled across Canada \u2014 West to East usually \u2014 and it\u2019s always been a memorable journey. Actually, the \u201cCanada\u201d I\u2019m referring to is the Canada Hall at the Canadian Museum of History, and my task has been to oversee the removal of artifacts in advance of a redesign to be completed by July 2017.\nThere were over 11,000 artifacts and other objects to be removed, and many of them were large and heavy. This was certainly not a one-person effort. As a Collections Coordinator at the Canadian Museum of History, I was part of a team that included Collections and Preparation staff, as well as outside contractors.\nIf you ever visited the Canada Hall, you\u2019ll remember a serpentine visitor route that wove back and forth through time and exhibit spaces. It was an excellent way to maximize use of the space. Unfortunately, that type of route is not so great when you need to remove artifacts . . . especially large ones.\nSpecialists carry the seven metre canoe. Photo credit: Steven Darby.\nThe larger artifacts were often a challenge, due to their size, weight and, in some cases, fragility. The large birchbark canoe in the Fur Trade exhibit was one such challenge. The canoe is 7 metres (almost 24 feet) long, which would make for a very tight diagonal fit in our freight elevator. On the positive side, the canoe is relatively light at just under 80 kilograms.\nTo move the canoe, I decided to keep it mounted on the gunwales, as it had been displayed. We also fashioned a long pallet on a raised dolly, which would allow the canoe, once placed on the pallet, to be safely wheeled out of the exhibition space.\nThere were only two options available when it came to removing the canoe from the Canada Hall, which is located on one of the Museum\u2019s upper levels. The first option would have involved having eight or nine people crammed into the freight elevator, holding up the canoe. Although we have sizeable freight elevators, the canoe would still have to be propped up diagonally from one corner to the other, and vertically from the upper right corner to the lower left. It would have fit, but just barely. The second option involved lowering the canoe through a light well to the first floor: a vertical drop of 15 metres.\nSpecialists prepare the canoe for the 15 metre descent. Photo credit: Steven Darby.\nI decided on the second option, as I felt it posed less risk to the canoe, and required no more human labour than the first.\nWe have all the necessary equipment onsite: a forklift, a boom and a heavy-duty come-a-long (winch). All I had to do was create a lifting frame to which I would attach the come-a-long cable. The lifting frame would then be positioned above the canoe and attached to the pallet at four points. A trial lift the day before ensured that everything was balanced and stable.\nWhen it came to the morning of the actual lift, it was a simple matter of raising the entire unit with the forklift boom, then manoeuvring it so that the assemblage was out over the rail. The unit was then lowered to a working height and, using the come-a-long, the entire canoe/pallet/lifting frame was slowly lowered to the floor below. It was successfully lowered onto the raised dolly and rolled to a collections space to await a conservation assessment.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/the-complicated-case-of-juliette-gaultier-de-la-verendrye/", "category": "Museum Research", "title": "The Complicated Case of Juliette Gaultier de la V\u00e9rendrye", "author": "Judith Klassen", "timestamp": "2015-03-17 00:00:00", "text": "Note: Some of the archival documents cited in this post use historical terminology that is no longer considered appropriate.\nJuliette Gaultier de la V\u00e9rendrye (1888\u20131972) is not a figure with whom I was well-acquainted upon my arrival at the Museum three years ago, and in all honesty I am not sure that I \u201cknow\u201d her any better today. Still, Gaultier has proven to be a presence both enigmatic and fortuitous during the intervening years. The more that I learn about her, the more interesting the implications for the work that we do here become: What does it mean to care for and cultivate national museum collections and archives? What makes an object or a sound \u201cCanadian\u201d? And what might we learn from historical examples of cultural exchanges and encounters?\n\nJuliette Gaultier de la V\u00e9rendrye promotional material. \u00a9 Canadian Museum of History, Juliette Gaultier fonds, F218_2_001.jpg; Gaultier F218_2_002.jpg\nCanadian soprano Juliette Gaultier was, and remains, a complicated character. Trained in Europe and then based in New York during the late 1920s, she performed what she called \u201cCanadian folk songs\u201d on the concert stage, seeking to entertain and educate her audiences.\nGaultier\u2019s Town Hall debut in 1927 was a huge success[1], and she was later invited to perform a 16-week engagement at the Neighborhood Playhouse \u2014 a New York venue that celebrated avant-garde performance and experimentation. Gaultier\u2019s connections in Canada and the United States during this period were significant and included figures like American portrait artist Langdon Kihn, Group of Seven painter Arthur Lismer, composer Marion Bauer, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and National Museum of Canada anthropologists Marius Barbeau and Diamond Jenness.\nThese latter connections enabled Gaultier to access the archives of the National Museum (now the Canadian Museum of History), from which she drew First Nations, Inuit, French Canadian and Acadian song repertoires for her performances. She was also able to borrow clothing from the Museum\u2019s collections for this purpose. Gaultier\u2019s association with the Museum gave her performances an air of authenticity in the eyes and ears of her audience.[2]\nIt is difficult to know what to think of these images of Gaultier. Viewed through a contemporary lens, questions of representation and cultural appropriation are impossible to ignore. What does it mean for a singer to use museum collections in order to \u201cauthenticate\u201d the presentation of expressive culture on stage? Related issues have been examined by scholars like Jessup (2008) and Slominska (2009), and take on tactile meaning within the museum context. While Gaultier\u2019s work from this period is charted through photos, letters and other media, we have no equivalent information about how the cultural communities from which her repertoire was borrowed might have responded. What does Gaultier\u2019s example tell us, quite literally, about historical voice and silence?\nAt the same time, Gaultier\u2019s letters and interviews seem to suggest good \u2014 if na\u00efve \u2014 intentions. In a 1930 interview, she asserts that her greatest interest is to hear First Nations and Inuit music sung, \u201ceither by the natives themselves, or at least when sung by white people they should be preserved in their natural form and the songs sung or harmonized to native instruments only\u201d (The Phonograph Monthly Review, 366). Gaultier studied diligently to ensure the \u201caccuracy\u201d of her performances, and in a letter to Diamond Jenness, Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson writes, \u201cSo far as I know this is the first time that Eskimo songs have been sung just as they are instead of being merely used as the basis or \u2018inspiration\u2019 for some sort of elaboration.\u201d\n\nGaultier did not become wealthy from her performances of \u201cCanadian folk songs\u201d and her success was not long lasting. Still, the questions raised by performances like hers continue to resonate, and underscore the complexity of cross-cultural exchange, representation and good intentions.\nCanadian Museum of History archives.

As a result of this influence, many of the prints issued in annual collections by Kinngait Studios from the 1960s to the present day have been printed on Eastern \u2014 specifically Japanese \u2014 paper. The Japanese word for paper that is handmade in Japan is washi.\nThe extensive use of washi by artists and printmakers of Kinngait Studios, from the first five Inuit printmakers to the contemporary artists who followed in their footsteps, is made clear when one examines the Inuit print collection at the Museum of History. Numbering over 6,000 individual works of art, the Museum\u2019s Inuit print collection is the most comprehensive of its kind in the world. The collection contains works by well-known Inuit artists such as Kenojuak Ashevak (1927\u20132013), the first woman to become involved in printmaking in Cape Dorset, whose 1969 print The Owl is printed on a sheet of washi.\nThe Owl (Proof III/100), by Kenojuak Ashevak, is printed on Japanese handmade paper (washi). The original drawing for this print was featured in Canada Post\u2019s Masterpieces of Canadian Art series of postage stamps. \u00a9 Canadian Museum of History, The Owl, Kenojuak Ashevak, CD 1969 055, IMG2009-0162-0137-Dm.jpg\nToday, a great many of the prints produced at the Cape Dorset studios continue to be printed on washi. The production of washi differs from the paper manufacturing techniques used in the West, which historically used cotton or linen rags until about 1850, when Western paper manufacturers began to use wood products. Instead, using a centuries-old tradition, washi is produced from raw materials that are native to, and grown in Japan, Korea, Eastern China and Southeast Asia.\nDistinct from the types of paper with which we are familiar in the West, washi has been recognized for its intrinsic cultural value. The differences in raw materials and manufacturing technique \u2014 much of which is still performed by hand \u2014 results in papers that, in all their variety, are significantly different in both appearance and character to Western-made papers. Furthermore, the creation of handmade paper in the Japanese way is in itself an art form. The people of Japan have designated several master papermakers as Japanese National Treasures, and the best of the papers that they produce as Important Intangible Cultural Properties. In 2014, washi was added to the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage,making it a treasure recognized not only in Japan but also around the world.\nAs the Museum of History\u2019s Paper Conservator, I interact with Japanese paper on two levels. Not only am I the caretaker for works of art printed on Japanese paper and charged with ensuring their long-term preservation in the National Collection, but I also use Japanese paper when undertaking conservation treatments. In fact, Japanese paper and Japanese tools and techniques that have been honed over centuries are core components of a paper conservator\u2019s skill- and tool-set.\nThe author treats a work of art from the travelling exhibition Inuit Prints: Japanese Inspiration. Photo: Norman Vorano.\nThe characteristics of a particular paper are the result of both its manufacture and the raw materials used in its production: fibres such as kozo (paper mulberry), mitsumata (oriental paper bush) and Ao gampi (rice paper plant). Where the papermaking fibres were grown; how the papermaking fibres were washed and cooked; how the sheet of paper was formed and then dried \u2014 all contribute to the paper\u2019s character, and thus what it is best used for. These factors also contribute to how a paper will age and perform during a paper-conservation treatment. It is therefore useful for a paper conservator to have this information about a paper before undertaking the treatment of a work of art produced on a washi support, or when selecting paper with which to treat an existing work. Additionally, awareness of the characteristics of a paper that has performed well, or perhaps not so well, in the Canadian context can allow for the recommendation of certain papers over others to artists concerned with the longevity of their work.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/inuit-prints-japanese-inspiration/", "category": "Inuit Prints...Japanese Inspiration", "title": "Inuit Prints \u2013 Japanese Inspiration", "author": "Patricia Corrigan", "timestamp": "2015-03-04 00:00:00", "text": "This is the story of how Japanese printmaking techniques made their way to the Cape Dorset print studio in the Canadian arctic. In this excerpt from the Inuit Prints \u2013 Japanese Inspiration exhibition catalogue, written Dr. Norman Vorano, former Curator of Contemporary Inuit Art at the Canadian Museum of History, you can learn more about the introduction of Japanese printmaking traditions to the Cape Dorset studio by Canadian artist James Houston, and the inspired adaptation and innovation that ensued.\n\u00a9 Canadian Museum of History, Owl, Fox and Hare Legend, Osuitok Ipeelee, 1959, CD 1959-021 SS, photo Marie-Louise Deruaz, IMG2010-0207-0037-Dm.jpg.\nThe remarkable story of this artistic encounter and its extraordinary result are the focus of Inuit Prints \u2013 Japanese Inspiration, one of the Canadian Museum of History\u2019s travelling exhibitions, which is currently being presented at the Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Sherbrooke.\nBy Dr. Norman Vorano\n[\u2026]\nThe 1950s and 1960s were turbulent times for Inuit across the Eastern Arctic, and the print studio served a great variety of needs. With the market for fox pelts in steep decline, many Inuit began to move away from a subsistence life in camps (where they predominantly depended upon hunting for food and fur trapping for trade goods) and took up permanent residence in the rapidly growing settlements, which offered opportunities for education, healthcare and employment. Reflecting upon his own transition into community life, artist Kananginak Pootoogook recalled that he moved into Cape Dorset in 1957, when his aging father, Joseph Pootoogook, required ongoing medical attention. To support his growing family, Kananginak found steady employment in the crafts studio, first as a maintenance worker and then as a printer. For many like him, the crafts studio provided a formalized yet flexible setting for employment and small-scale entrepreneurship through the sale of arts and crafts. Art was embraced because it met the people\u2019s changing social and economic needs, as well as their desire to remember a way of life that seemed to be rapidly disappearing.\nThe fall of 1958 was a pivotal time for the Cape Dorset print program. The printmakers assembled a collection of graphics based largely on their own drawings, published in editions of thirty. Known retrospectively as the \u201cexperimental\u201d or \u201cuncatalogued\u201d collection, it was said to have numbered up to twenty different stonecut or linocut prints, with some evidence of brayer stencilling[i] (Figs. 1,\u00a02, 3, 4 in the image gallery). Thirteen of these new prints were put on sale on December 12, 1958 at the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company department store in Winnipeg.[ii] The sale was a success and generated a positive reaction, with the Winnipeg Free Press reporting that the prints were \u201cclose in design to the now world-famous Eskimo sculpture.\u201d [iii]Casual sales\u2014largely undocumented today\u2014of these experimental prints continued into early 1959 at Canadian Handicrafts Guild outlets in Montreal and Toronto.[iv]\nIronically, this taste of success prompted [Canadian artist James]\u00a0Houston\u2019s superiors at the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources to put a temporary halt on the distribution of prints. Eyeing greater potential, the department revised its marketing strategy and decided to retail prints through higher-end art galleries with carefully staged annual releases, rather than selling them through department stores. The early experimental prints were removed from circulation and the studio began afresh, directing its energies towards the completion of its first annual collection, which was to be officially released later that year (the collection was eventually released in February 1960). This set the stage for the final transformation of the Cape Dorset crafts shop into a fine art print studio. But one element was missing: the influence of \u201cJapan, the land of prints.\u201d[v]\nAlthough Houston had studied art at the Ontario College of Art and the Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in Paris, he had, by his own admission, relatively limited printmaking experience when he began working in Cape Dorset.[vi] Wanting to bring a greater knowledge of printmaking to the Arctic, in the fall of 1958 he used his accumulated leave to travel to Japan in order to study woodblock printmaking with Un\u2019ichi Hiratsuka, one of Japan\u2019s most revered print artists of the twentieth century[vii]. While in Japan, Houston met with and learned from many other Japanese artists, including Shik\u014d Munakata, Sh\u014dji Hamada, Keisuke Serizawa, Kichiemon Okamura, Sadao Watanabe and Yoshitoshi Mori, as well as the Muraoka family\u2014three generations of traditional doll-makers. He witnessed first-hand Japan\u2019s flourishing mingei (folk crafts) movement, meeting its principal philosopher, the famous S\u014detsu Yanagi, and gave public and private lectures on Inuit art, including a black-tie presentation to Japan\u2019s Prince Mikasa. After a rewarding three-month trip, Houston returned to the Arctic in the spring of 1959 and shared what he had learned in Japan with the Cape Dorset printmakers. He brought specially made Japanese printmaking tools and washi (handmade paper) to Cape Dorset, as well as a collection of Japanese woodcut and kappazuri (stencil) prints created by some of Japan\u2019s greatest modern print artists. [\u2026].\nOver the spring and summer of 1959 the Cape Dorset studio blossomed. Buoyed by the artistic and technical possibilities seen in the Japanese prints (not to mention the tantalizing spark of public interest after the first Winnipeg sale), the Inuit printmakers began producing more technically sophisticated, larger and more aesthetically accomplished prints. They were inspired by the powerful and expressive sumizuri (black ink prints on white paper) by Un\u2019ichi Hiratsuka and Shik\u014d Munakata, the flowing colours in Kichiemon Okamura\u2019s kappazuri prints, and the creative use of negative shape (unprinted surface) in Yoshitoshi Mori\u2019s works. Yet the Cape Dorset printmakers did not slavishly imitate Japanese artists. Endlessly inventive bricoleurs, they selectively borrowed from their far-flung sources, adapting and modifying the practices, tools, techniques and stylistic elements that best reinforced their own aesthetic and cultural values. Perhaps most importantly, the first five Inuit printmakers\u2014Osuitok Ipeelee, Iyola Kingwatsiak, Eegyvudluk Pootoogook, Kananginak Pootoogook and Lukta Qiatsuk\u2014actively improvised and adapted along the way. Their determination, resourcefulness, willingness to experiment and ability to absorb remarkably cosmopolitan influences are a testament to their creativity, imagination and self-confidence. These qualities have been hallmarks of the Cape Dorset studio for over five decades.\n[\u2026] End of excerpt.\nIn our next post, Canadian Museum of History Paper Conservator Amanda Gould will tell the story behind washi, one of the key materials used in many of the Cape Dorset prints, and the role it plays in conserving our National Collection.\n[i] For the North American perception of Japan as \u201cthe land of prints,\u201d see Alicia Volk, \u201cJapanese Prints Go Global: S\u014dsaku Hanga in an International Context,\u201d in Made in Japan: The Postwar Creative Print Movement, ed.

In the exhibition, we weren\u2019t trying to make anyone love snow. Our intention was to show that snow \u2014 whether you love it or hate it \u2014 is a part of Canadian history and experience.\nNear the end of the exhibition, we asked visitors, \u201cIs snow important to you?\u201d Our visitors responded to this question by creating thousands of notes and drawings that reflected their thoughts about snow. Visitors could read each other\u2019s comments and, as a member of the team that created Snow, I received regular packages of comment cards that piled, a little like snowbanks, in my office.\nThe comments were wonderful, and they reflected the messages and experiences that we had created in the exhibition.

A favourite destination for thousands of Europeans and Americans since the 18th\u00a0century, Canada became an important destination in the mid-19th century for African-Americans, for whom the name \u201cCanada\u201d was synonymous with freedom.\nThe Canadian Museum of History has recently acquired the handwritten text of a song expressing a slave\u2019s desire to flee the United States. The song is the work of Joshua McCarter Simpson (1820\u20131876), an African-American composer and agent on the Underground Railroad. Titled \u201cI\u2019m on My Way to Canada,\u201d the song tells the story of a slave who wants to escape north of the border, despite the difficult climate \u2014 our \u201ccold and dreary land.\u201d Simpson composed the song in his home state of Ohio in 1852, and it first appeared as part of a collection in Original Anti-Slavery Songs, a pamphlet published that same year containing several songs promoting the abolitionist cause.\nThe American Civil War was a few short years away. The rift between the South and the North, between the forces for and against slavery, was deepening. Following the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850, the stream of migrants from slave states to Canada was on the rise. Even in the North, many were leaving for Canada, fearing the efforts of slave catchers who, by virtue of the 1850 Act, had the right to recapture any escaped slave, even if they lived in a free state. Consider, for example, the case of Shadrack Minkins, once a slave in Virginia, who fled to Boston, where he found work as a waiter. Following his surprise arrest on February 15, 1851, and a spectacular escape, Minkins was whisked away to Montr\u00e9al. The adventure cost the Boston Vigilance Committee $1,400, a major portion of which was defrayed through a public appeal. Little by little, the abolitionist movement gathered momentum \u2014 and for good reason.\nDepiction of Slave Family, labouring for their master\u2019s benefit, from \u00ab Hauling the Whole Week\u2019s Picking\u201d, painting by William Henry Brown, 1842. Historic New Orleans Collection : 1975.93.2. Cotton was the backbone of the plantation economy in the Southern United States during the first half of the 19th century.\nThe 1850 Act sent shockwaves through the African-American community. The Underground Railroad, a clandestine and illegal system conducting those fleeing slavery in the South to British North America, grew in size. According to historian Larry Gara, the Black community became increasingly involved in the operation of the Underground Railroad. And behind the Railroad, there was an entire movement \u2014 a veritable counterculture \u2014 fighting for the abolition of slavery. The movement used every means at its disposal. Abolitionist candidates were presented for election. Newspapers were published, including William Garrison\u2019s famous Liberator and Frederick Douglass\u2019 North Star. Scores of flyers, letters and newspapers were sent through the mail, both to promote the cause and to assist slaves in their personal escape plans.\nThe campaign against slavery was highly visible. The impact of Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s bestseller, Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, is a case in point. Originally serialized in 1851, the narrative was published as a complete novel in March 1852. By October, just a few months later, sales had reached 125,000 copies. A French version was published in Montr\u00e9al under the title of La Case du P\u00e8re Tom in 1853. This meant that, as a young man, Wilfrid Laurier was able to read about Uncle Tom in his mother tongue. A play based on the novel was staged in Toronto and elsewhere. Although the novel\u2019s success may have been due largely to its publisher\u2019s brilliant marketing strategy, there is no denying that there was also considerable demand for this type of crusading literature. The mass movement against slavery was taking flight.\nMusic has always been an integral part of protest. Abolitionist gatherings, held across the United States, featured songs advocating the pursuit of liberty and the suppression of slavery. These songs were sometimes sung by everyone in attendance or by professional and semi-professional choirs, such as the celebrated Hutchinson Family Singers \u2014 well known for their hit, \u201cGet off the Track\u201d \u2014 who often appeared at these events, and who attracted more than 20,000 people to a rally in Boston. Simpson was by far the most prolific composer of these songs, and his works figured prominently at abolitionist rallies. Song served as a medium of communication and mass persuasion.\nHandwritten lyrics to the song \u201cI\u2019m on my way to Canada,\u201d \u00a9Canadian Museum of History, 2014-H0013, photo Steven Darby, IMG2014-0080-0001-Dm\nTo take full advantage of the persuasive power of song, Simpson used a strategy common to the wave of evangelical revivals that shook the United States at the beginning of the 19th century, matching his lyrics to the best-known melodies of the day. He thus drew on the music of \u201cblackface\u201d minstrel shows, which were enormously popular across the U.S., and which featured songs performed by white actors with blackened faces. The most famous composer of this genre was\u00a0unquestionably Stephen Foster, whose hits, \u201cOh! Susanna\u201d (1848), \u201cCamptown Races\u201d (1850), and \u201cSwanee River\u201d (1851) \u2014 all of which became American standards \u2014 were \u201cblackface\u201d songs. Simpson co-opted these melodies, matching, for example, the words of \u201cI\u2019m on My Way to Canada\u201d to the melody and tempo of \u201cOh! Susanna.\u201d As Simpson explained in 1852, \u201cMy object in my selection of tunes, is to kill the degrading influence of these comic Negro Songs [\u2026], and change the flow of these sweet melodies into more appropriate and useful channels.\u201d In this way, Simpson sought to transform these songs from instruments of subjugation and repression into forces to help achieve liberation.\nCanada is a central and recurring theme in Simpson\u2019s songs and is even the focus of some of them. For example, the narrator of \u201cI\u2019m on My Way to Canada\u201d describes his escape from a cruel plantation owner to reach faraway Canada \u201cwhere coloured men are free\u201d and where a benevolent sovereign awaits him with open arms. Similarly, the songs \u201cThe Final Adieu\u201d and \u201cThe Son\u2019s Reflections\u201d \u2014 adapted to the tunes of \u201cCamptown Races\u201d and \u201cSwanee River\u201d respectively \u2014 relate the desire of slaves in the American South to break their chains and escape to British North America. These songs expressed and, through public performance, conveyed an image of Canada as a destination both real and mythical for those seeking freedom in the mid-19th century. They are both artifacts of a protest movement and hymns to freedom.\nJohn Willis and Tim Foran\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/legislative-council-of-the-province-of-canada-votes-45-15-for-confederation-otd-in-1865/", "category": "1867 - Rebellion and Confederation", "title": "Legislative Council of the Province of Canada votes 45-15 for Confederation #OTD in 1865", "author": "Patricia Corrigan", "timestamp": "2015-02-20 00:00:00", "text": ""}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/interview-with-canadian-history-hall-directors-chantal-amyot-lisa-leblanc-and-dr-david-morrison/", "category": "Behind the Scenes", "title": "Interview with Canadian History Hall Directors Chantal Amyot, Lisa Leblanc and Dr. David Morrison", "author": "Patricia Corrigan", "timestamp": "2015-02-18 00:00:00", "text": "Amyot: My role is to direct the project by ensuring that all aspects of the development are planned and executed as per expectations. I am therefore committed to having the new hall ready for Canada\u2019s 150th anniversary in July 2017. This work encompasses aspects such as project management, overall museological approaches, exhibition development, design, budget monitoring and control, all with the contribution of an amazing team: a lot of fun stuff!\nLeblanc: I am responsible for directing the development of the experience, how the content will be communicated with visitors. I have a team of Creative Development Specialists with a solid foundation in audience engagement, exhibition development and museological approaches. Using this rich experience, the team is working with the exhibition\u2019s curators and designers to produce the best possible visitor experience.\nMorrison: My role is to direct research and the development of content. In this I am supported by a team of historians, researchers and archaeologists, and we work closely with our museological staff in figuring out what we want to say and how we want to say it. We also work with academic and Aboriginal external advisory committees and consult with Aboriginal communities and stakeholder groups.\nDirector, Canadian History Hall Project\nAmyot: I have been at the Museum for 26 years, and have done many things. My immediate previous position was Director of Exhibitions, which prepared me well for my new tasks on this project. As Director of Exhibitions, I was responsible for managing the complex multiyear exhibition program developed by our institution and presented in Gatineau as well as across Canada and internationally.\nLeblanc: I have worked at the Museum of History, and previously the Canadian War Museum, for over 15 years. I had the privilege of working on the development of the permanent exhibitions and visitor experience for the new Canadian War Museum, which opened in 2005. Before this project, as Director of Creative Development and Learning for the Museum of History, I oversaw the visitor experience for new exhibitions including, design, media production, and the development of school and public programs.\nMorrison: I have worked for the Museum for over 30 years. My previous position was Director of the Archaeology and History Division. When I took on this project two years ago, it was in the anticipation of greater challenges and the desire to end my career with so major an accomplishment. I will retire when it is completed.\nAmyot: Vision is a big concept. I hope to contribute to a new and exciting presentation on the history of our country. The way we think, talk and present history changes over time. The same is true for museology. Museums are always renewing themselves and finding new ways to communicate and engage with the public. It is very thrilling to be part of such an important and meaningful project.\nLeblanc: My vision for the Canadian History Hall is to provide opportunities for visitors to engage with the past, and to have a greater sense of who we are and where we came from. If we can create experiences that are fun and inspire delight, and that make the past relevant by showing history doesn\u2019t live in black and white images, but is meaningful and has an impact on our daily lives, then we will have succeeded.\nMorrison: My vision for the hall, my goal, is to tell the story of Canada \u2013 the stories of Canada \u2013 so the average museum goer can understand why it is so riveting a story, and why it is relevant to their lives today. History to a nation is like memory to an individual: without it, we have no personality, we don\u2019t know who we are.\nDirector, Research, Canadian History Hall Project\nMorrison, Amyot and Leblanc: It takes lots of patience, time to plan, organize, communicate and establish a rhythm for all members of the team and, most of all, drive, enthusiasm and motivation. It also requires you to listen actively to all involved to make sure everyone sees the purpose of their work and the value of their contribution. There are so many aspects to consider, sequencing them correctly is always challenging. It\u2019s also important that we keep a view of the whole, look at the long game and plan for a marathon. There is a lot to do to get to opening day, and we are always keeping an eye on the big picture.\nAmyot: That question is too difficult to answer: too many answers! Let\u2019s say high on my list is the thrill of travelling. I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to have discovered many beautiful parts of the world and of this great country. It always keeps you wanting more. Museums are a small glimpse on the world so I guess that\u2019s why I like it so much.\nLeblanc: Design has always been a passion for me. I\u2019m am amateur enthusiast and probably drive our design teams crazy with my interest in floor plans, finishes, materials and fonts. My family is my greatest passion. There is nothing better than coming home after a busy day and shutting out the world, chatting through the highlights of their days, and being involved in their lives and the planning of their futures.\nMorrison: Well, history of course is one of them. Another is cabinet-making, where I also have much to learn. Travel is also on the list, especially Canadian travel, and especially northern Canadian travel, and I\u2019ve been all over.\nDirector, Creative Development and Learning, Canadian History Hall Project\nAmyot: David can sing along to any classic Rolling Stones song (and play air-guitar!). He is guaranteed to make you laugh at least twice a day. Lisa is curious and sharp, and she gets inspiration from all walks of life. Who knew muffin recipes could apply to the exhibition-development process?!\nLeblanc: Chantal is the most focused, detail oriented, hardworking and decisive person. Her laugh is so big, it would pierce through the densest stadium crowd. It\u2019s wonderfully infectious. David is endlessly passionate about history: the stories, the people, the stuff! He loves it all! And he is so keen on building the History Hall that he makes others around him passionate as well.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/prototype-of-the-pearson-pennant/", "category": "Collection", "title": "Prototype of the \u201cPearson Pennant\u201d", "author": "", "timestamp": "2015-02-17 00:00:00", "text": "Known as the \u201cPearson Pennant,\u201d this design for a Canadian flag was proposed by Prime Minister Lester B.

Celebrating Valentine\u2019s Day with messages of love is a tradition that dates back centuries. An early example is a valentine from 1477, housed at the British Library. In it, Margery Brews writes to her fianc\u00e9, John Paston, \u201cUnto my right well-beloved Valentine John Paston, squire, be this bill delivered.\u201d\nOn this side of the Atlantic, interest in Valentine\u2019s Day became apparent by the 1860s. Stationers advertised a vast array of valentines in newspapers such as The Gazette, The Globe and Mail and The Morning Chronicle. The popularity of valentines is no doubt what led the Post Office to make special mention of valentines in a new 1867 law providing for a uniform postal system for the entire new Dominion. \u201cValentines,\u201d stated the law, \u201cmust be treated in all respects as ordinary letters, and the same care is to be taken both in their delivery and despatch.\u201d\nValentine\u2019s Day cards played an important role in courting rituals of the 19th\u00a0century. Valentines served, in effect, as ambassadors. The pen became a substitute for a person\u2019s physical presence. The first valentines were handmade and were used well before the advent of postage stamps and the use of envelopes. Valentines were written on a sheet of paper, which was then carefully folded and secured with a wafer of sealing wax. The name and address were written on the outside of the paper. These cards, dating from the 1840s, often featured an ink drawing or watercolour, along with a personal message.\nValentine\u2019s Day cards were expected to represent the good taste and sincerity of the suitor. How many evenings must lovers have passed, seated at their writing desks, cutting out, pressing and assembling the decorative elements for their valentines. Once the design was completed to their satisfaction, they would take out their writing instruments to compose a sonnet or verse that would speak on their behalf.\nTo assist lovers lacking in inspiration, small manuals on the art of writing were readily available. These contained verses that could be transcribed onto a sheet of paper for people producing their own valentines. These booklets fell within a broader tradition of manuals related to letter writing and etiquette. Valentines manuals were popular during the 1830s and 1840s, but could still be found during the final decades of the 19th century. Despite their mediocre printing quality, the manuals were described in such grand terms as \u201celegant, fashionable, polite, original, sentimental, instructive\u201d and so on.\n\n\u00a9 Canadian Museum of History, Valentine Verses or Lines of Truth, Love and Virtue, Reverend Richard Cobbold, 1827, no 2007.100, IMG2015-0024-0004-Dm.\n\nAdvertisement describing the range of valentines available from the stationer Murray & Co., in The Gazette, Montr\u00e9al, March 4, 1875. Source: Library and Archives Canada / Montr\u00e9al Gazette / March 4, 1875 / AMICUS 1412639\nDuring the 1850s and 1860s, valentines with highly elaborate designs became popular. Valentines with handwritten verses gradually disappeared, to be replaced by manufactured cards. Advances in printing techniques made it possible to produce valentines that were nothing short of sumptuous. Cards might be decorated with entwined hearts, then enhanced with perfumed silk, shells and ribbons. The materials ranged from paper lace all the way to quilted satin, and even velvet. Some valentines were so elaborate that they had to be mailed in protective boxes. Merchants offered a nearly infinite array to please all tastes, all fancies and all pocketbooks. Highly extravagant and costly valentines also remained available, contributing to a redefinition of the standards of elegance and good taste.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/a-burning-question/", "category": "1867 - Rebellion and Confederation", "title": "A Burning Question", "author": "Patricia Corrigan", "timestamp": "2015-02-10 00:00:00", "text": "\nIllustration of burning Parliament building\n\u00a9McCord Museum, The Burning of the Parliament Building in Montr\u00e9al, Joseph L\u00e9gar\u00e9, about 1849, M11588\nMontr\u00e9al. April 25, 1849. An enraged mob approaches the Parliament building of the Province of Canada (present-day southern Ontario and southern Quebec).\nIncited by Montr\u00e9al\u2019s English newspapers, the politically conservative Anglophone mob is bent on revenge for what it sees as an act of treachery. The Governor General, Lord Elgin, has just given royal assent to the Rebellion Losses Bill, which will indemnify Francophones for property losses during the ill-fated 1837 rebellion against British rule. The aim of the Reformers who put the Bill forward was to compensate innocent bystanders. In the eyes of the mob, however, Lord Elgin is agreeing to reward traitors. Earlier this day, they had pelted his carriage with cobblestones and rotten eggs.\nReaching Parliament at dusk, the mob throws rocks at the building, shattering its windows. The mob then streams inside to destroy the chambers. It retreats \u2014 but only to set the building on fire. The violence persists for a few days.\nThese cobblestones were among those thrown at Lord Elgin on April 30, as the riots continued. Lady Elgin, his wife, gathered and labelled the stones, which were thereafter kept as family heirlooms.\n\u00a9Canadian Museum of History, 2008.118.3, 2008.118.4, photo Steven Darby, IMG2014-0156-0010-Dm\nLord Elgin\u2019s willingness to allow the Rebellion Losses Bill to pass, in spite of the violent opposition of powerful segments of the population, was Canada\u2019s first experience of responsible government \u2014 power residing not with Britain but with the majority in an elected Canadian Parliament.\nThe Montr\u00e9al riots expressed the views of a minority. These were reform-minded times, and responsible government, which had long been a core principle of government in Great Britain, was popular with British North Americans. In Nova Scotia, reformers had in fact obtained responsible government shortly before. They had done so without \u201ca blow struck or a pane of glass broken,\u201d as one of their leaders, Joseph Howe, proudly put it. Within six years, the lieutenant-governors of Britain\u2019s other North American colonies had followed Lord Elgin\u2019s lead, paving the way to Confederation.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/in-1841-the-act-of-union-is-proclaimed-upper-canada-a-lower-canada-united-under-one-government-province-of-canada/", "category": "Significant Dates", "title": "In 1841 the Act of Union is proclaimed; Upper Canada a/ Lower Canada united under one government \u2013 Province of Canada", "author": "Jason Prini", "timestamp": "2015-02-10 00:00:00", "text": ""}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/remembering-the-also-rans-of-the-great-flag-debate/", "category": "Our Flag at 50", "title": "Remembering the \u201cAlso-Rans\u201d of the Great Flag Debate", "author": "Forrest Pass", "timestamp": "2015-02-06 00:00:00", "text": "The Canadian Museum of History is marking the 50th birthday of the Canadian flag with a display that shows how politicians, graphic designers and ordinary Canadians contributed to the iconic maple leaf design. The display features a number of flag proposals, but the Museum\u2019s collection includes some additional prototypes that didn\u2019t make the cut.\nEven before the Great Flag Debate of 1964, Canadians submitted thousands of flag designs to the government for consideration. Most of these were rough sketches, but some proponents believed so strongly in their designs that they had full-size cloth versions produced.\nOne of the most popular designs was promoted as early as the 1940s by the Ligue du drapeau national and the Native Sons of Canada. The Native Sons distributed thousands of these flags to encourage the design\u2019s adoption as the national flag. Most versions were printed on nylon, but the Museum\u2019s example was hand sewn by Stella Dent, probably during the 1950s.\n\nA Canadian flag prototype designed by Dr. Ken Dent and sewn by his mother, Stella Dent.\n\u00a9Canadian Museum of History, 2006.1.442, IMG2012-0210-0013-Dm\nThe designer of another proposed flag in the Museum\u2019s collection is a mystery, but the symbolism of the flag is clear. The red, white and blue cross motif suggests the British flag and some pre-revolutionary French flags, while the American flag was likely the inspiration for the 10 stars, which represent the 10 provinces. This design \u2014 perhaps this very flag \u2014 appears in a photograph of the parliamentary flag committee\u2019s deliberations. Can you spot it?\n\nOne multi-coloured, rectangular, nylon flag.\n\u00a9Canadian Museum of History, 2007.214.1, IMG2009-0135-0093-Dm\n\nCommons flag committee\nLibrary and Archives Canada, PA-213164, \u00a9Cliff Buckman (CP)\nGeorge Bist\u2019s design was remarkably similar to the flag that was ultimately selected, but it had blue stripes rather than red ones. Reid Scott, a Toronto MP on the flag committee, strongly favoured this design. Like the paintings in the flag anniversary display, the Museum\u2019s example of this flag was used as a prop during the committee\u2019s deliberations. It illustrates mounting support for a simple, single maple leaf design.\n\nA Canadian fiag prototype designed by George Bist.\n\u00a9Canadian Museum of History, 19890086-323\nAs our display on the design of the Canadian flag shows, the committee\u2019s challenge was to find a simple but meaningful symbol for Canadians. So how do these forgotten contenders stack up next to the winning design? They all feature the maple leaf, a popular Canadian symbol long before 1965. However, they are also more complicated than the final selection. Each uses at least three colours, and the maple leaves are more detailed and more difficult to recognize at a distance than the final 11-point version.\n"}, {"link": "https://www.historymuseum.ca/blog/your-museum-your-stories/", "category": "Behind the Scenes", "title": "Your Museum.

On this blog we\u2019ll talk about our past, sharing stories achievement, struggle and loss, and those of survival, success and great hope for the future. We\u2019ll also share stories about the Canadian Museum of History and the people who work here so that our readers can learn more about their national museum of history. We\u2019ll talk about the exhibitions we\u2019re developing, our research projects, different moments in Canadian history and objects from the National Collection \u2014 an all-around insider\u2019s look behind the scenes at the Canadian Museum of History.\nOn this blog we\u2019ll also share project updates and stories about the team that is creating the new hall so that Canadians can see some of the work that goes into creating an exhibition of this scope. We hope that you will follow the development of the groundbreaking, 4,000 square metre Canadian History Hall through this blog, up to its grand opening on July 1, 2017.\nMost importantly, though, this blog will be a place where you can share your stories and engage with the Museum and other Canadians.
