Well, you make a cast of his face leaving you with what\u2019s called a death mask of course!\u00a0 Quite peculiar to us, death masks were common during this time but with the advent of early photography, the practice soon went away.\nA little more along the lines of what we\u2019re used to, this striking oil painting by lifelong socialist, artist and illustrator Clifford Hooper Rowe (1904-1989) shows an operating theatre nurse preparing tools for surgery while donning a surgical mask.\u00a0 Depicting scenes of industry, war, working life, and ordinary people, Cliff Rowe produced art commonly referred to as socialist realism \u2013 the style of art that emerged from the Soviet Union in the 1920s.\u00a0 Influenced by this art style during his time living in the Soviet Union, Rowe went on to have an interesting career both as a socialist and as an artist.\u00a0 Rowe designed posters for the Red Army and Clement Atlee\u2019s post war Labour government.[2]\nThe Rochdale and Littleborough Peace Group, a grassroots organisation that campaigns for causes such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the Stop the War Coalition, unhappy with Tony Blair\u2019s apparent reluctance to show remorse for those who had died during the British supported US led invasion of Iraq, staged a walkabout in Rochdale town centre in 2010 where one of their members donned a Tony Blair caricature mask and \u2018Dodgy Dossier\u2019.\u00a0 Their petition called for the indictment of Blair at an international war crimes tribunal under both the Geneva and Hague Conventions which cited 14 alleged war crimes. [3]\u00a0 Although only the \u2018Dodgy Dossier\u2019 resides in PHM\u2019s collection and not the mask, the combination of the two demonstrates a perfect example of how mask and costume can be used for the purpose of protest.\u00a0 Find out more about the Rochdale and Littleborough Peace Group.\nAn object that was similarly used on a public demonstration is the recently acquired Alien Anthropologist mask that was displayed in the Protest Lab within PHM\u2019s exhibition, Disrupt? Peterloo and Protest (23 March 2019 \u2013 23 February 2020).\u00a0 This mask is one of five created by cartoonist Polyp for a 1996 street theatre protest on Manchester No Shop Day; part of the anti-consumerism campaign, Never ENOUGH?\u00a0 For this campaign a group of confused, amateur alien anthropologists were led through Manchester city centre by a human intergalactic tour guide, who valiantly (and hilariously) struggled to explain to them the joys of shopping, the rubbish in the street, why a clothing store might be called Envy, and what the strange visual and verbal messages on advertising hoardings actually mean.\u00a0 Made from vacuum formed plastic sheeting and one of the more peculiar masks in this list, the Alien Anthropologist mask best exemplifies the use of \u2018out of this world\u2019 humour and satire as a form of political and social commentary.\nLess of a mask but more of a sealed rubber bag, this creepy looking World War II era device actually intended to keep babies and very small children safe during a gas attack.\u00a0 The baby would be placed inside this device and the parent would have to regularly pump filtered air into the bag.\u00a0 This meant that if the parent didn\u2019t pump enough air through the device the baby could easily suffocate.\u00a0 One can only imagine how difficult this might have been, while trying to also care for the rest of the family, with the sound of air raid sirens and the roar of bombers bellowing across the city of London.\u00a0 The reason this object is so different from the typical gas masks we usually associate with this period is due to the fact that babies\u2019 lungs would not have been strong enough to breathe hard enough to use the gas masks suitable for older children and adults.\u00a0 Fortunately, as gas attacks were never used against the British civilian population during World War II, these gas masks wouldn\u2019t have seen much use, but still became \u2018a disturbing memento of the home fronts\u2019 wartime experience\u2019.\u2019[4]\nPHM has a substantial collection of Cliff Rowe paintings, donated by the artist in 1985.

illustrating queer migrant journeys.\u00a0 The aim of the project was to primarily initiate a safe and inclusive space for queer stories to exist within and to be initiated by their narrators, preserving authenticity and rawness while raising awareness on queerness, migration and difference.\u00a0 Each workshop covered a certain theme that deconstructed notions of borders, nostalgia, visibility and resistance.\u00a0 Supported by Homotopia and Journeys Festival International, the zine was exhibited on various online platforms and was featured in Journeys digital festival.\nBeing a queer person, a migrant from the age of eight and of Muslim background are all basepoints that almost dictate the way I artistically work, particularly on a project like Queer Journeys.\u00a0 I arrived in the UK in 2013 from Kuwait, where I grew up, after (almost) fleeing Algeria with my family and its socioeconomic struggles.\u00a0 Having come from two equally homophobic countries, I thought I could finally live my sexuality with less fear, prejudice and repression.\u00a0 However, in parallel, I had forgotten I had arrived in a country, hypothetically, tens if not hundreds of years ahead of where I came from in terms of sexual tolerance, and hardly had any clue as to how I would initiate defining my sexuality and gender.\nI was unaware of the internalised prejudice, the guilt, the shame, the internalised trauma that I was blind to.\u00a0 I discovered gay scenes and forced myself into their template which I barely understood, a template that was scary yet familiar.\u00a0 I was surrounded by hundreds of queers and felt one of the crowd, for once!\u00a0 So I partied, for days, engaged in extreme hedonism, I tattooed my body, wore outrageous things, constructed and destroyed myself at the same time while thinking that was the way to be gay.\u00a0 Until, I realised I was trying too hard to puzzle the complex definition of being queer.\nDefining sexuality was an obstacle that I unlearned to fear, yet what I was obvious to was the fact my name was Youcef with a \u2018c\u2019, I grew curly hair, had a bit of an undefined accent and enjoyed eating pork.\u00a0 I almost forgot I was different, racially and culturally, until the knife cut deeper.\u00a0 Suddenly, I realised I had another obstacle to define and deal with.\u00a0 I was a queer-conforming, beer-loving, curl-growing, not-so-Muslim-looking Muslim, which seemed an impossible equation to a lot of people.\u00a0 I came from two different cultures people had barely heard of, or at least had a mainstream media-fed assumption about.\u00a0 How do you hit two birds with a stone, when you were never taught how to throw?\nI spent years trying to deconstruct the link between the fear and familiarity I felt, the race and the sexuality, but more specifically; home and where I am, here and back there.\u00a0 I kept on concluding that something was wrong with me and that each attempt I sought to connect the three worlds together, I failed at.\u00a0 I had to find a coping mechanism to survive and tools to fight with, and saw that strength in people I could relate to.\u00a0 So I reached out to spaces, circles, groups and collectives where we had those conversations and pushed the discourse further.\u00a0 I understood that my weakness was probably a strength, with which I could not only fight prejudice but also be able to read myself.\n\nQueer Journeys was an outcome of the above, which I had reached through creating a space where those weaknesses and strengths were discussed in an intersectional way.\u00a0 Participants were pushed to reflect upon themselves and see elements we relate to within a structure that opposes us.\u00a0 Throughout the project I framed each workshop around a certain theme that relates to being a queer migrant.\u00a0 For instance, one of my favourite workshops was \u2018Belonging\u2019 where we all worked individually and collaboratively to define \u2018home\u2019 and queering our thinking of \u2018home\u2019 as a notion.\u00a0 Each participant was asked to think of the queerest thing from home that had a meaning to them alongside a short piece of text that contextualised the chosen visuals.\u00a0 From sculptures, to mothers, artists, found graffiti to policemen, it was almost therapeutic to perceive \u2018home\u2019 from the queer perspective of each participant.\nAmong the five workshops, each studying a different theme, I, for a rare moment, felt part of a crowd again.\u00a0 Participants were migrants from all corners of the world, each coming with a completely different cultural baggage and history.\u00a0 Yet, we found commonalities in the smallest details and felt strongly connected, yet all we were connected to was an internet connection and a screen to which we spoke.\u00a0 We opened up and shared collective knowledge while learning from our stories and traumas.\u00a0 Through that, I learned more about my own experiences, yet in a way that made me, at least, feel less isolated in the most isolating of times.\nYoucef Hadjazi will be talking as part of PHM\u2019s Radical Late on Thursday 11 February (6.00pm to 8.30pm) in a programme celebrating LGBT+ histories for OUTing the Past Festival that also includes Migration, Race & Empire: LGBT+ histories tour with Maggy Moyo and Jenny White and Category Mistake by performance artist Mandla Rae.\u00a0 The event is suitable for 18+ and bookable in advance via Eventbrite with donations welcome.\nThis event is part of a programme of events and exhibitions exploring migration.\u00a0 And whilst the museum is closed you can also visit PHM\u2019s 2020 \u2013 2021 Banner Exhibition online.\u00a0 The banners in the exhibition reflect past and present migration movements and the many challenges and opportunities that migration presents.\nFebruary is LGBT+ history month and the OUTing the Past Festival is taking place online this year.\u00a0 There is a huge programme of events to explore from your home and online.\nFor families who want to explore equality and love, we\u2019ve created a Doodle Den resource full of fun drawing activities, inspired by a banner in the collection, that promotes LGBT+ rights.\n"}, {"link": "https://phm.org.uk/blogposts/2020-reader-favourites/", "category": "", "title": "2020 Reader Favourites", "author": "", "timestamp": "2021-01-08 00:00:00", "text": "For the first blog post of this year, we take a look back at your favourite reads from last year.\nThousands of you have read People\u2019s History Museum\u2019s (PHM) blog each year, where we share posts from the PHM team and other experts, with behind the scenes stories, coverage of PHM\u2019s exhibitions, events and Learning Programme and highlights from the museum\u2019s unique collection; but which posts were most popular?\n\nThe story of William Cuffay clearly appealed to lots of you, as it was our most read 2020 blog.\u00a0 Back in April, on the anniversary of the 1848 Chartist mass meeting on Kennington Common, London, PHM Researcher Dr Shirin Hirsch explored the life of PHM Radical William Cuffay and revealed a precious, rare and poetic treasure of Cuffay\u2019s from the museum\u2019s collection.\u00a0 The object in the story, gifted to Cuffay as he set sail on a prison ship for Tasmania in 1849, is on display in the museum\u2019s Labour History Archive & Study Centre, accessible by appointment, so you can come and see it for yourselves when PHM eventually reopens.\n\nFrom June, another story from PHM\u2019s Researcher Dr Shirin Hirsch makes the top five most read blogs of 2020; here Shirin took a closer look at the history of migrant workers documented in the museum\u2019s collection. \u00a0At PHM we are currently rethinking how we see this global British history through our programme theme exploring migration, which includes our Community Programme Team planning a series of \u2018interventions\u2019 into our main gallery spaces, expected later in the year.\n\nOn 16 August we once again commemorated the anniversary of the Peterloo Massacre, and for this story we invited Robert Poole, Historian and Professor of History at the\u00a0University of Central Lancashire\u00a0(UCLan), to guest blog about Samuel Bamford, radical reformer and writer who was present at Peterloo. \u00a0This was a treat of a read from the author of Peterloo: the English Uprising (2019), co-author of the graphic novel Peterloo: Witnesses to a Massacre (2019), and consultant historian to the 2019 Peterloo bicentenary commemorations in Manchester.\n\nContinuing with Peterloo, a guest blog (which may have popped into your inbox by surprise yesterday!) written back in 2019 to celebrate International Women\u2019s Day, made the top five for the second year running.\u00a0 This story was penned by our former colleague and the National Trust\u2019s Programme Curator of National Public Programmes, Helen Antrobus.\u00a0 From the women who marched at Peterloo, to the female Chartists; those involved with the women\u2019s suffrage movement, to the first female MPs, Helen shared with us her specialist insight into the women at Peterloo.\u00a0 You can read our full collection of Peterloo related blog posts and look out for stories about two early Peterloo treasures within the museum\u2019s collection.\nAnd finally and unsurprisingly in a year of closures, a post from the past highlighting objects on display at the museum proved extremely popular.\u00a0 For this story we invited Steven Fielding,\u00a0Professor of Political History at the University of Nottingham\u00a0to discuss his top five object highlights from the People\u2019s History Museum\u2019s collection for a series of object highlight films.\nIn addition to this blog exploring PHM\u2019s collections online, public events previously taking place at the museum have found a life on the museum\u2019s website, including those focused on PHM\u2019s headline theme for 2020-2021;

resulting in falling levels of popular trust in political institutions and parties, declining political engagement, and a growing resentment among electorates at the lack of political representation.\n\nSo, if we were to choose to, it would perhaps be easy to become depressed at both a system of democracy \u2013 first past the post \u2013 that encourages polarisation and also by an ever increasing belief that decision making lies ever further away from we, the people, and that our voice and our interests count for very little.\nBut, against such a prevailingly gloomy picture, where the state of democracy in the UK and elsewhere is increasingly worrying, what can we do about it, and who is doing it?\nIf history teaches us anything, it is that we the people simply refuse to accept what patently doesn\u2019t work for us.\u00a0 And that opposition to the absence \u2013 or diminution \u2013 of our rights and of equality and representation, that have been so hard won, finds a way to be heard, to be taken notice of, and to help manifest positive change.\nIf there is one theme to be heard again and again at People\u2019s History Museum, it is that protest and activism have become ingrained in our culture.\u00a0 It is one of the cornerstones and strengths of our, albeit dysfunctional, democracy.\u00a0 And the evidence of its effectiveness is everywhere in the museum; demonstrating how the disaffected have found their voice, articulating demands that have influenced tangible change.\u00a0 And at a time when people may increasingly feel ignored or disaffected, and it may be difficult to see and hear evidence of this activism, it is undoubtedly present.\n\nIn fact, an increasing number of us are taking action, often in new ways.\nFor example, between January and June 2020 and the corresponding period in 2019, change.org experienced a 119% increase in the number of people starting petitions in the UK \u2013 and a 116% increase in those signing them.\u00a0 So, while trust and transparency appear to be low and falling, it is a fact that grassroots protest \u2013 of registering disapproval, of demanding positive change, of speaking your mind \u2013 is alive and well.\nAway from the grassroots, and contributing to the context and backdrop in front of which local activism plays out, large scale protests garner significant media coverage and can dominate the news agenda \u2013 helping issues to both become and remain high profile.\u00a0 Black Lives Matter (BLM), born of outrage and anger, amplified by media and online, and fuelled by an unshakeable refusal to allow the status quo to remain, has become a significant global movement with an ongoing record of catalysing significant change in political and civic life.\nGlobal protest movements such as BLM or Greta Thunberg\u2019s school strike for climate will ensure that a generation finds and maintains its voice over a lifetime, catalysing change.\u00a0 In addition, there are examples of individuals who have successfully used their profile and reputation to register protest, gaining wide support and building pressure that has helped bring about positive change.\u00a0 Here in Greater Manchester, Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford\u2019s \u2018victory\u2019 in achieving an extension of free school meals during the Covid-19 pandemic is the most current and best known example.\n\nBut \u2013 and extremely importantly \u2013 effective activism isn\u2019t just the domain of the famous and well known \u2013 people or movements.\u00a0 Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, junior doctor Rebecca McCauley started a change.org petition expressing frustration at the lack of testing for NHS workers, calling for them to be prioritised.\u00a0 The petition quickly gathered more than 1.5 million signatures, was picked up by national media and within days the government promised to make NHS staff a priority for tests.\nCommenting on the rise in activism experienced through channels such as change.org, Sophie Walker, author of Five Rules for Rebellion; Let\u2019s Change the World Ourselves says \u2018there is a lot that is depressing about the state of the world.\u00a0 But the responding rise in activism is a cheering counter-energy\u2019.\nSo, let\u2019s celebrate this counter-energy.\u00a0 As an increasing number of us find new ways to register our disapproval, to stand up for what we believe in, and to demand positive change, at People\u2019s History Museum we recognise the unique obligation and opportunity we have to help provide a focal point, as well as a repository for stories, and a space where all of this positive activism can be documented, celebrated and encouraged.\u00a0 Whether by sharing and exploring the impact on us all of momentous global change born of activism and protest, or by inspiring and motivating local and grassroots activism \u2013 online and in our communities \u2013 the national museum of democracy has an important and active role to play.\nAnd we intend to play our part to the fullest; demonstrating what we can all learn from centuries of protest and activism, capturing and interpreting the national or global zeitgeist, and also by putting ourselves at the service of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s activists and change makers.\nNo matter how poorly we may feel we are governed, long live activism;

this time it was in prime position on the hustings with Emmeline Pankhurst as she addressed the crowds.\nThe significance of the \u2018First in the Fight\u2019 message was to remind the wider WSPU movement, which by this time had moved their headquarters to London, that radical Manchester was the place where this incredible movement had begun!\nThe Manchester suffragette banner was made by Thomas Brown and Sons, Manchester. \u00a0They were a well known maker of church banners in the local area.\u00a0 Many aspects of ecclesiastical design can be seen in the style of the banner, including the lettering which is similar to that seen on many Sunday School banners, and \u00a0the embroidery which is a key feature of ecclesiastical design patterns.\n\n\nThe Manchester suffragette banner was looked after by suffragette, embroider and factory worker Elizabeth Ellen Chatterton who was born in Salford in 1857. \u00a0The family story tells of her embroidering the banner in 1908. \u00a0We think Elizabeth Ellen may have worked at Thomas Brown and Sons, although the surviving records do not allow us to conclusively prove this theory.\nThe banner was looked after by Chatterton and later by her family in Salford, then Manchester before moving to Leeds. \u00a0Family photos shared with People\u2019s History Museum, show her descendants standing proudly with the banner in 1989.\n\nHowever, in 2003/2004, the banner vanished following a house clearance. \u00a0Elizabeth Ellen\u2019s great granddaughter Suzanne Bath recalls making frantic enquiries to neighbours, local builders, house clearers, clergy, estate agents and charity shops to find the banner but to no avail. \u00a0The next the family was to hear of the banner was in an article in The Guardian in September 2017, once PHM had acquired the banner. \u00a0When Suzanne and her daughter were reunited with the banner in The Conservation Studio at PHM there were tears of joy!\nThe journey for PHM to acquiring the Manchester suffragette banner began in June 2017 with a simple listing on saleroom.com for a \u20181903 Manchester suffragette banner\u2019.\u00a0 Researcher, writer and suffrage antique dealer Elizabeth Crawford kindly alerted Salford\u2019s Working Class Movement Library about the sale initially; the Library was PHM\u2019s partner at that time in a National Lottery Heritage Fund Collecting Cultures project called \u2018Voting for Change\u2019, and both Elizabeth and the Library encouraged PHM in the pursuit of the banner.\u00a0 The banner was due to be auctioned at Gary Don auctioneers in Leeds the following week.\nOn the day of the auction, former PHM Conservator and banner specialist Vivian Lochhead and I went to view the banner.\u00a0 Further examination of its style and condition enabled us to authenticate the banner.\u00a0 Vivian discovered the maker\u2019s label \u2018Thomas Brown and Sons, Manchester\u2019 in the banner sleeve (the section at the top for the pole).\u00a0 Sadly, PHM was outbid in the auction and I left devastated that we would never bring the banner home to Manchester.\u00a0 Thankfully, the dealer who had purchased the banner agreed to sell it to PHM and we began a highly successful crowdfunding campaign.\u00a0 We also made a successful application to the Arts Council England/V&A Purchase Grant Fund to complement existing funding PHM had secured from The National Lottery Heritage Fund\u2019s Collecting Cultures programme. \u00a0The banner finally made it to The Conservation Studio at PHM in late August 2017.\nWe discovered that following the house clearance the banner had been in the safe keeping of a small charity called HOPE (Halton Moor and Osmandthorpe Project for the Elders). \u00a0The banner, we are told, was stored in a filing cabinet; so miraculously had escaped light damage and arrived with its beautiful and vibrant purple velvet intact!\nThere was considerable public and media interest in the banner and in September 2017 it made a special trip to London to appear on the BBC\u2019s The One Show alongside 2016 US Democratic presidential nominee Hilary Clinton. \u00a0In 2018, the centenary year of the passing of the Representation of the People Act, in which all men and some women gained the right to vote in Britain, the banner took centre stage in PHM\u2019s commemorations and went on public display for the first time in the exhibition Represent! Voices 100 Years On.\n\nThe incredible challenges we\u2019ve faced as a museum as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic that has taken place in 2020 mean that PHM\u2019s future is under threat.\u00a0 The treasures in the museum\u2019s collection, such as the Manchester suffragette banner, remind people of the unique work of PHM, and how we use the collections to bring people together, encourage them to share their stories, and to continue the fight for a fairer world.\nPeople\u2019s History Museum is a unique cultural organisation. \u00a0It is the only museum in the country that explores the past, present and future of British democracy, championing ideas worth fighting for such as votes for all, equality, co-operation, social justice, and a fair world for all.\u00a0 We believe having a museum such as ours has never been more important, and that there is nowhere more fitting for iconic pieces such as the Manchester suffragette banner to call their home.\nWe hope that the banner that declares First in the Fight will inspire people to see that People\u2019s History Museum is a museum worth fighting for.\nThe Manchester suffragette banner will be on special display for a limited period at People\u2019s History Museum when the museum reopens.\nDon\u2019t miss the banner\u2019s appearance in the final episode of Channel 4\u2019s series Britain\u2019s Most Historic Towns with Professor Alice Roberts, airing on Saturday 19 December 2020 at 8.20pm.\nThe Manchester suffragette banner is one of PHM\u2019s ten treasures; ten pieces picked out by the museum team that they believe capture the ethos, spirit and importance of the museum\u2019s collection.\n"}, {"link": "https://phm.org.uk/blogposts/manchesters-museum-and-gallery-adventures-from-home/", "category": "", "title": "Manchester\u2019s museum and gallery adventures from home", "author": "", "timestamp": "2020-11-20 00:00:00", "text": "With Manchester\u2019s museums and galleries temporarily closed again, many have moved activity online to provide a whole range of amazing cultural digital experiences.\u00a0 Here are some of the best:\n\nAlthough the doors to our museum are closed until Thursday 3 December, this marks the start of a series of new ways to discover the stories, collections and spirit of the national museum of democracy.\nYou can join PHM\u2019s Head of Collections & Engagement, Jenny Mabbott, and actor Alfred Enoch on a Google \u2018Art for Two\u2019 tour, or explore our treasures for yourself with a 3D tour of the galleries.\nWe will also be continuing to bring people together for inspiration, conversation and creativity through our online programme of events, Ideas Worth Exploring.\n\nHOME\u2019s trio of exhibitions may have only had their doors open for less than a fortnight, but that\u2019s no reason to miss out \u2013 all three are now available online with a video tour from curator Bren O\u2019Callaghan, image galleries and artist interviews.\u00a0 Explore Joy Yamusangie\u2019s bold and thought-provoking Blue Glass Fortunes, immerse yourself in the unsettling dreamscapes of MSR FCJ\u2019s\u00a0 Bubbling Pitch or join the villagers of a fictionalised version of Eyam as they battle through Our Plague Year as reimagined by Nick Burton.\nYou can also engross yourself in the strangely beautiful post-apocalyptic Last Place On Earth, created during lockdown by the Future 20 Collective.\u00a0 The Future 20 Collective is a group of artists aged 18-25 who undertook HOME\u2019s 12 month training initiative in 2019 \u2013 2020.\u00a0 The collective is made up of filmmakers, poets, spoken word artists, photographers, visual artists, musicians, theatre performers and producers and a glass artist.\nWorking with artist Ivan Morison, Future 20 have created a virtual reality (VR) environment that invites you to imagine the last place on earth.\u00a0 A utopian place, not to feel alone in but where you can consider reconnecting with mother nature and planting seeds for change.\n\nOver the coming weeks, Manchester Museum will continue to connect and inspire, sharing content from its collection, exploring narratives to spark joy and wonder during these challenging times.\nVisit their\u00a0online exhibitions \u2013 Beauty and the Beasts: falling in love with insects, Minerals: sustainability and hidden stories, and The British Museum spotlight loan \u2013 A Ming Emperor\u2019s seat, and explore the\u00a0wonderful stories of their collection.\nParents, carers and teachers are also covered with\u00a0resources for families\u00a0and\u00a0adults to entertain and inspire.\u00a0 And creative and fun activities with workshop ideas for carers can be downloaded with the\u00a0Cultural First Aid Kit.\nListen to the\u00a0Manchester Museum Podcast\u00a0series with special guests, and join the museum in an open and honest conversation and reframe how museums care and take action to build understanding, empathy and love for our world and each other.\nThe\u00a0mmfromhome.com website brings the Manchester Museum to you.\n\nPlay has been postponed at the National Football Museum for a few weeks but there\u2019s still plenty of action off the pitch.\nThe current exhibition\u00a0Strip!

in addition to PHM\u2019s online programme of events and exhibitions, Ideas Worth Exploring, I am especially excited to share some new and exciting digital developments at PHM.\nTwo new projects, with Google Arts & Culture and The University of Manchester, represent a huge step forward in our ambition to make the stories and collections that PHM represents as accessible as possible.\u00a0 These are stories that have meaning and relevance to people\u2019s lives today, which makes them incredibly powerful. \u00a0As well as people being able to visit the museum when we reopen, we want to reach out to inspire people with the achievements of those who have fought and championed for rights, freedoms and equalities and those who are continuing these quests in today\u2019s world.\nWe have just launched the museum\u2019s Google Arts & Culture profile, featuring some brilliant stories relating to Black Lives Matter, the Peterloo Massacre, PHM\u2019s Ten Treasures and the wonderful banners in the museum\u2019s collection.\u00a0 There\u2019s also a\u00a0Google \u2018Art for Two\u2019 video to watch, in which actor Alfred Enoch joins me for a virtual tour of PHM\u2019s galleries. \u00a0And there\u2019s lots more to commemorate and celebrate black history, from PHM and beyond.\n\nWe have also collaborated with The University of Manchester to develop a\u00a03D tour of PHM\u2019s main galleries.\u00a0 It is superb quality, and we\u2019ve embedded videos and high resolution images throughout;

suggest plentiful food \u2018for all not for the few\u2019.\n\nGiven the date of the banner, and some other details of the woman\u2019s representation, the imagery may also have a further hidden message.\u00a0 She is wearing a cap of liberty; since the time of the French Revolution a symbol of political freedom, adopted by English radicals at Peterloo and other 19th century protests.\u00a0 The banner\u2019s date coincides with a time of great political change \u2013 in particular the enfranchisement of women, after a decades long struggle for the right to vote.\u00a0 It is possible that this strong and confident female figure, with her laurel wreath of victory and cap of liberty, also represents the newly emancipated woman.\nBanners are made for both display and for marching with in processions.\u00a0 Although we know little of the banner\u2019s history, we can make some educated guesses.\u00a0 The Hampstead Labour Party had many famous members.\u00a0 Influential socialist economists Sidney and Beatrice Webb, whose desk can be seen on display next to the banner, were both members, as was the early 1980s Labour Party leader Michael Foot.\u00a0 All may have marched with the banner at some point. \u00a0It is even possible that the Webbs were involved in its design and production as they were prominent members at that time.\nThe banner was donated to the museum by the family of Paul Segal, who during the 1950s was Chair of the Hampstead Labour Party, and it is here that the connection with the Vietnam War can be found.\u00a0 Paul was married to the world famous psychoanalyst Hanna Segal, a former member of the Polish Socialist Party, and both were lifelong supporters of leftwing politics.\u00a0 The banner\u2019s last known political use was when it was carried at the protests against the Vietnam War in 1968 outside the US Embassy in Grosvenor Square, London.\u00a0 The demonstration ended in violence, but the banner survived!\u00a0 At some point after that it was folded up, put away in the Segals\u2019 attic and forgotten about.\u00a0 It is very exciting that it ended up in the museum\u2019s collection and it will remain on display until January 2022.\nRevamping a quarter of PHM\u2019s main galleries, the majority of banners on display at the museum change annually.\u00a0 Visit the current selection of historic and contemporary banners including the Hampstead Labour Party banner, all specially conserved by the museum\u2019s expert Conservation Team. \u00a0The 2020 \u2013 2021 Banner Exhibtion is part of PHM\u2019s year long\u00a0programme exploring migration, co-created by a Community Programme Team made up of people whose lives have been shaped by migration.\nPeople\u2019s History Museum is open six days a week, from 10.00am to 5.00pm,\u00a0closed Mondays.\u00a0 The museum and its exhibitions are free to visit with a suggested donation of \u00a35.\u00a0 To find out about visiting the museum, its full exhibitions and events programme visit the museum website\u2019s\u00a0home page.\n\nDiscover more about the Arts and Crafts movement and its links to environmentalism \u00a0through an online tour exploring the theme Hidden Nature for Heritage Open Days, with PHM Programme Officer Zofia Kufeldt. \u00a0Hear the stories of those who have campaigned for nature and the environment over the last 200 years.\nFind out how the museum\u2019s Programme Team created the\u00a0Protest Lab space\u00a0in 2019 and get an insight into contemporary objects of protest that were collected for display.\n"}, {"link": "https://phm.org.uk/blogposts/culture-is-open-come-and-see-us/", "category": "", "title": "Culture is Open - come and see us!", "author": "", "timestamp": "2020-10-28 00:00:00", "text": "Manchester\u2019s museums and galleries have been working hard to make sure they provide safe and enjoyable experiences \u2013 all have additional coronavirus measures in place and they remain open under the Tier 3 restrictions.\u00a0 If you\u2019re planning a cultural day out in the city, we\u2019ve created a handy roundup of what\u2019s on and a map of Manchester\u2019s museums and galleries, to help you plan your itinerary.\nMost galleries will need you to book a ticket in advance \u2013 usually for free \u2013 and may be operating slightly different opening hours to usual, so please check the websites in advance of your visit.\n\nEnjoy a friendly welcome at the national museum of democracy, and explore the past, present and future of ideas worth fighting for.\u00a0 Throughout two Family Friendly galleries and the latest Banner Exhibition, discover ground-breaking stories of the Peterloo Massacre of 1819, votes for women, workers\u2019 rights, and more ideas worth fighting for of today, with hands-on and digital interactives along the way.\nCheck out the special exhibition Images of Protest: Black Lives Matter, and PHM\u2019s 2020 \u2013 2021 programme exploring migration;

2021).\u00a0 Soft Bodies takes its title from Soft-body dynamics, a field of computer-generated graphics which creates simulations of soft materials such as muscle, fat, hair, vegetation and fabric.\u00a0 The increasing availability of this kind of software has given artists new tools to make work; manipulating \u2018digital clay\u2019 in limitless space.\nFor Obstructions, Castlefield Gallery invited 15 artists from the North West of England to re-make an existing piece of their work with one condition: they had to accept a bespoke \u2018Obstruction\u2019 given to them by another artist in the exhibition.\u00a0 Inspired by a long history of artists using self-imposed restrictions to aid creative or free thinking, it also riffs off the restrictions and disruptions caused by Covid-19.\ncastlefieldgallery.co.uk\n\nPurpose-built to tell the powerful stories of over a century of war, IWM North makes full use of its extraordinary exhibition space to deliver an award-winning

\u2013 Multiplicities in Flux, bringing together works by photographer Grace Lau and filmmaker Eelyn Lee, and Omid Asadi\u2019s Autopsy of a Home.\nMultiplicities in Flux brings together works by Grace Lau and Eelyn Lee in a dialogue around identity and belonging in Britain.\u00a0 Lau\u2019s series of portraits 21st Century Types (2005) reflects the multiplicity of contemporary British society and comments on the othering of Chinese people and culture through photography, while Lee\u2019s film Britishness (2019) investigates the often indefinable notion of \u2018Britishness\u2019.\nIn the

Pan-African Congress, which took place in Manchester (15 \u2013 21 October 1945).\u00a0 We asked PHM Researcher Dr Shirin Hirsch and historian Geoff Brown to look at a document on display in the museum\u2019s main galleries and to blog about the role of black activists in Manchester in the build up to the Congress.\nThe fifth Pan-African Congress, which took place in Manchester from 15 to 21 October 1945, was a watershed moment in world history; arguably one of the most important events to take place in Manchester in the 20th century.\u00a0 It is an event we celebrate at People\u2019s History Museum (PHM) as part of our local, national and global history of democracy. \u00a0The Congress held 200 attendants with 87 delegates representing 50 organisations from across the world.\u00a0 Many delegates would return to Africa newly inspired as part of a network of Pan-Africanists. \u00a0Jomo Kenyatta, Kwame Nkrumah and Dr Hastings Banda were key delegates at the Manchester Congress and went on to lead anti-colonial movements against Britain, becoming the first leaders of the independent nations of Kenya, Ghana and Malawi respectively. \u00a0The Nigerian delegates included the future finance minister, Obafemi Awolowo, future foreign minister, Jaja Wachuku, and future federal minister, H O Davies. \u00a0The Congress gave agency to African people in the remaking of the modern world and the struggle for decolonisation.\nThe fifth Congress met in Chorlton-on-Medlock Town Hall, the original entrance of which is now part of Manchester Metropolitan University\u2019s Arts and Humanities building.\u00a0 Previous Pan-African Congresses had been held in Paris, Brussels, Lisbon, London and New York, but the Congress in Manchester was the most important; taking place just after the end of World War II, with the weakening of colonial powers and the development and confidence of the feeling of colonial subjects that independence must become a reality.\u00a0 As the longstanding organiser of past Congresses and black intellectual W E B Du Bois argued, the fifth Pan-African Congress made 1945 a \u2018decisive year in determining the freedom of Africa\u2019. \u00a0In the Picture Post magazine report entitled \u2018Africa speaks in Manchester\u2019, the journalist explained that Manchester was chosen as the site of this Congress because \u2018its people have less curiosity or hostility towards colour than the people of any other English city\u2019. \u00a0Another article in the Manchester Guardian, however, quoted a delegate from Jamaica, Miss Alma La Badie, who found the people of Britain \u2018not unkind, but entirely ignorant of the conditions under which people live in the lands where their flag is flown \u2013 disgusting conditions which would surely appal them if they knew\u2019. \u00a0Dr Peter M Milliard of Manchester, president of the Pan-African Federation, in introducing the Lord Mayor to speak at the Congress, said that those who had lived here must agree that Manchester was probably the most liberal city in England. \u00a0More importantly though, after first Paris and then London had been proposed, with the deadline approaching, it became clear that the Congress had to be held in Manchester, the strongest centre of Pan-African organisation in Britain.\nThere were rich black networks in Manchester that existed prior to the Windrush generation. \u00a0One of the key Pan-Africanists during the war years was Ras T Makonnen, who was central to the Congress taking place in Manchester. \u00a0Makonnen was born in British Guiana, and as he became more involved in the Ethiopian cause following the Italian invasion in 1935 he took the name Ras Tefaris Makonnen. \u00a0He studied in America and Denmark and came to London in early 1937 where he shared a flat in London with the Pan-African leader George Padmore. \u00a0During the war Makonnen left London when, with the onset of the Blitz, a lot of the Pan-Africanists decided to disperse across the country to avoid conscription and retaliation by the state. \u00a0They had refused to be recruited to the war effort, with their key focus not on supporting Britain but in opposing colonial Britain and all it stood for \u2013 \u2018We are only concerned about the man who is on our shoulders now\u2019 as Makonnen put it. \u00a0Makonnen chose Manchester as his new destination because Dr Peter Milliard was already here and he was able to \u2018room with him for a time\u2019.\nMilliard, also born in British Guiana, trained to be a doctor at the black Howard University in Washington DC. \u00a0During World War I he worked as a medic in Panama where he helped lead a canal workers\u2019 strike.\u00a0 He settled in Manchester, establishing a general practice in Lower Broughton which became an important support centre for black seafarers arriving at the nearby Salford docks.\u00a0 Milliard founded the International Brotherhood of Ethiopia in Manchester opposing the 1935 Italian invasion of Ethiopia, organising and speaking at street meetings in Stevenson Square in central Manchester.\nWhen he first arrived in Manchester, Makonnen lectured at the Co-operative College in Holyoake House, Hanover Street. \u00a0Seeing the need to provide spaces free of \u2018colour bars\u2019 for Manchester\u2019s black communities, he set up a chain of restaurants along the top of Oxford Road.\u00a0 These included the Ethiopian Teashop, the Cosmopolitan, the Orient, a club called the Forum and a place called Belle Etoile. \u00a0He went on to open a bookshop and founded a publishing house producing a stream of pamphlets and the excellent monthly magazine Pan-Africa. \u00a0The restaurants were hugely successful, attracting black seafarers, West Indian servicemen and African workers based in Greater Manchester. \u00a0The venues were wildly popular with black American GIs from the giant US airbase at Burtonwood near Warrington which, like all US armed forces at the time, was segregated. \u00a0For a time Jomo Kenyatta, future president of Kenya, managed the Cosmopolitan, and Kath Locke, Moss Side community activist and co-founder in the 1970s of the black women\u2019s Abasindi Co-operative, worked there. \u00a0Through the profits Makonnen made he was able to help finance the hosting of the fifth Pan-African Congress and at a time of the \u2018colour bar\u2019 when accommodation was difficult, provide spaces for black delegates. \u00a0His links to the Lord Mayor of Manchester and the Labour Party, who had political control of the city at the time, also meant the securing of the large Chorlton-on-Medlock Town Hall as the venue for the Congress.\nPHM\u2019s collections show this rich black history that existed in Manchester.\u00a0 With a peak membership of 500, The Negro Association, Manchester was a key network, established in 1943 by Peter Milliard, providing the basis for the Manchester branch of the Pan-African Federation founded in 1945. \u00a0The association actively encouraged solidarity with anti colonial struggles, for example raising money in support of the great Nigerian general strike in the summer of 1945.\u00a0 The document pictured above (on display in Main Gallery Two) shows the names and addresses of members of The Negro Association in Manchester.\u00a0 We can see their names, not through the patronising and racist reporting at the time, but through the handwriting most likely of Milliard himself.\u00a0 There is plenty more research to be done on the lives of those on the membership list; some are famous, like Kenyatta, but others we know little about.\u00a0 The membership list, in demonstrating black self-organisation and agency within Manchester, stands in contrast to the Picture Post article we started this blog with, where the Congress is veiled through the words of the condescending journalist noting the \u2018positive side of our rule in Africa\u2019 and patronisingly commenting that \u2018hothead\u2019 delegates of the Congress held \u2018extremist\u2019 views.\u00a0 It is hard, from these media reports, to get a sense of the exhilaration and sense of freedom that black people must have felt meeting and organising in Manchester. \u00a0Walking into the Town Hall for the Congress, with the flags of black independent nations on display, there must have been a feeling of pride and determination to continue the struggle in Africa against colonial rule and in opposing the \u2018colour bar\u2019 in Britain.\u00a0 For those who had previously organised in Manchester, the Congress must have been particularly inspiring, taking a leading role in the process of self-emancipation from colonialism and racism.\u00a0 We will leave the last words to Mr Richardson (seen on the membership list as Richinson) of Manchester, a delegate of the Congress.\u00a0 He had lived in England for 45 years and explained to the reporter that he intended to stay \u2018to help civilise the English people\u2019.\u00a0 We remain indebted for such actions.\nAt PHM we are continually building on the collection, and we would love to add more to represent the history of migrants and BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) communities in Britain over the last 200 years.\u00a0 If you have any objects or archives you think would be an important addition to

History Museum\u2019s (PHM) current home, the museum team picked out ten pieces that we believed capture the ethos, spirit and importance of PHM\u2019s collection. \u00a0This month Collections Officer Sam Jenkins pieces to together clues from the past to reveal the story of one of PHM\u2019s most treasured objects.\nObjects from the working class are still very rare in museums, especially from key moments like the Peterloo Massacre. \u00a0Despite the 60,000 person strong crowd, the vast majority of objects that help us to tell the story of the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester are either related to the yeomanry and magistrates, or are commemorative objects created after the event. \u00a0In museums across England, there are very few objects that can help tell us about the protestors themselves.\nThis isn\u2019t just because working class objects weren\u2019t collected by museums at the time (though, of course, they weren\u2019t) but also because of the harsh laws that were put into place after the massacre. \u00a0Following the horrific day, laws were passed that restricted people\u2019s rights to criticise the government, including restricting the right for groups to meet. \u00a0To be found in possession of any object that aligned you to the radical cause was a very big risk, and not one that many people would have taken.\nWith these objects being so rare, it was almost unbelievable to be offered a Peterloo cane \u2013 something that had a high chance of being used by a member of the crowd that was assembled in Manchester on 16 August 1819.\n\nThe donor contacted the museum, as he had heard about our exhibition Disrupt? Peterloo and Protest (23 March 2019 \u2013 23 February 2020) and wanted to offer us a family heirloom \u2013 a cane with a sentence about Peterloo scratched into it:\n\u2018I was one of the dreadfull [sic] bludgeons seen on the fields of PETERLOO\u2019\nAs soon as it was offered, we knew that we would have to see it to believe it \u2013 and to figure out what its story was. \u00a0With this sentence scratched into it, there was a split chance between it being a souvenir, taken by one of the yeomanry or a Special Constable, or a memento kept by a member of the crowd, and we needed to figure out which. \u00a0After a discussion with the museum\u2019s Acquisitions Panel, we agreed that I would meet the donor and have a closer look at the cane, to be brought in to the museum for a full investigation.\nAs there is no possibility of a photograph or an eye witness to confirm if an object was really present at a major event such as Peterloo, we have to examine these objects carefully to pull out all the clues that we can.\nWhen I met the donor, and saw the cane for the first time, it was clear that it was very special. \u00a0The donor told me how it had been passed down through his family and had slowly lost the connection of what, exactly \u2018Peterloo\u2019 was; when he heard about the museum\u2019s exhibition, Disrupt? Peterloo and Protest, he immediately thought about the cane sitting in his wardrobe and decided to offer it to us. \u00a0He had also started to trace his family tree, managing to make it up to a Charles Worsley who was a joiner in the Manchester area around 1819. \u00a0From that, we knew that the family were in the right place at the right time.\nLooking at the cane that first time, it became evident that there was far more written on it than had first been noticed. \u00a0Along with the clearest inscription \u2018I was one of the dreadfull [sic] bludgeons seen on the fields of PETERLOO\u2019 was another line of carvings that looked like names, starting with \u2018HUNT\u2019 and ending with \u2018WORSLEY\u2019. \u00a0It was clear that we needed to look in closer detail, and for longer.\nWith the donor agreeing to deposit the cane for us to research before officially deciding on the acquisition, I was able to take longer and use different techniques to try and figure out as many of the inscriptions as possible. \u00a0Using raking light and photo editing, I managed to decipher the list of names:\nHUNT CARTWRIGHT COBBE WOOLER KNIGHT WORSLEY\nIt seemed very likely that Hunt referred to Henry \u2018Orator\u2019 Hunt, the key speaker at Peterloo, but what of the others? \u00a0Cartwright could be Major Cartwright, a nationally respected reformer, and Wooler was a journalist who had been associated with the radical movement. \u00a0John Knight was also on the speakers stand with Hunt, so only the name \u2018Cobbe\u2019 was unexplained (unless this is actually \u2018Cobbett\u2019, as in pamphleteer and journalist of the time, William Cobbett). \u00a0Finally, came the surname of the owner, \u2018Worsley\u2019.\n\nThis really became clear when, with the aid of PHM\u2019s Conservation Team, I was able to see the cane under UV light. \u00a0While looking at the cane with our conservators, Jenny and Kloe, we noticed that there were inked drawings on and near the handle. \u00a0After spending a few minutes wondering what the spade-like drawing was, it came to us \u2013 it was a cap of liberty! \u00a0Looking closely revealed two caps of liberty and a flying flag drawn onto the cane. \u00a0Under the UV light it was clear that these were underneath a layer of varnish, while the two carved inscriptions were made after the varnish had been put on.\n\nWe finally had enough evidence to piece together the story of the cane. \u00a0The drawings of symbols of radicalism suggested that the cane had been carried by a member of the crowd. \u00a0The inscription about Peterloo could have been the boast of a victor, but the inclusion of the surname of the owner alongside those of Hunt, Cartwright and Knight suggested instead that it was a satirical comment on the claims that the protestors had been armed. \u00a0The family history tied the cane to the area around Manchester at the right time, and to a man who would have been respectable enough to carry a cane as part of his Sunday best, but still would not have held the right to vote.\n\nBut the story isn\u2019t yet wholly complete, as there are more inscriptions that still need to be deciphered.\u00a0 Part of one of the inscriptions says \u2018brought to justice\u2019 but the rest of the sentence is too unclear to make out using the methods we have available. and the others are even harder to see, but my gut feeling is that one of them says \u2018Liberty\u2019.\nThis cane is a real connection to the men and women who met at St Peter\u2019s Field in Manchester to call for reform, and were cut down for it.\u00a0 Such a tangible link to working class history is like gold dust, and it\u2019s a real privilege to be able to share this story with future generations.\nThe Peterloo cane is on public display in Main Gallery One until January 2021, coinciding with the screening of a new BBC Four documentary with historian Lucy Worsley, some of which was filmed at the museum.\u00a0 In the programme, which will broadcast in the autumn, Lucy is introduced to the Peterloo cane.\nThe meeting held on St Peter\u2019s Field in Manchester on 16 August 1819 was a protest for rights and representation and is the point at which the story of revolution begins in the main galleries of People\u2019s History Museum.\u00a0 The peaceful protest was broken up by the authorities leading to the death of 18 people and the injury of over 700.\u00a0 \u00a0Find out more about what happened at the Peterloo Massacre from PHM Researcher Dr Shirin Hirsch.\n2020 marks the

00:00:00", "text": "Contemporary collecting is at the core of what People\u2019s History Museum (PHM) does, it has been since the museum was established in Manchester in the early 1990s.\u00a0 Year on year, with an ever increasing number of dramatic events unfolding and campaigns for change emerging locally, nationally and globally, the role of contemporary collecting has become even more important.\u00a0 Here PHM\u2019s Director Katy Ashton shares the inside story on what contemporary collecting means to the national museum of democracy and why it has launched a fundraising campaign to support this work.\nLots of museums work on contemporary collecting, but it means different things to each one, and there\u2019s no official definition of what counts as \u2018contemporary\u2019.\u00a0 Many focus on events from around the last 50 years which are underrepresented in their collections.\u00a0 What makes PHM\u2019s contemporary collecting different is that our focus is very modern and for the most part, focused on issues and events that are happening right now.\nIt is an inherent part of how we collect and how we represent the UK as the national museum of democracy.\u00a0 We don\u2019t collect contemporary material as part of a dedicated project to fill gaps in a collection; but just as a way of doing things at PHM.\nAs such PHM\u2019s collection expands from events such as the Ambulance Dispute of 1989 through to events in recent weeks and months, including Black Lives Matter protests and Covid-19.\n\nPHM\u2019s collecting of Black Lives Matter protest material and Covid-19 related items both fall into the category of key events, as well as recent Brexit collecting before and after the referendum in 2016.\nThe definition of contemporary is relative and changes over time, with objects for example collected in the 1980s or 1990s seen as contemporary then, but no longer the case 30 years later. \u00a0However, to give an indication, in 2019 around 80 of PHM\u2019s 210 new acquisitions were connected to contemporary topics or events.\nOne of the museum\u2019s most recent acquisitions is a collection of\u00a0 images taken by photographer Jake Hardy at a Black Lives Matter protest in Manchester on 31 May 2020.\u00a0 These images came into the PHM collection in June.\u00a0 They are one of a number of ways that PHM\u2019s collection is already reflecting the Black Lives Matter movement and will continue to do so.\u00a0 They will not be static additions to the collection, these images will be used to inform and stimulate discussions, bring people together, aid research and feature in future exhibitions.\nAs the museum develops its future programme themes there will be the opportunity for objects to feature in exhibitions \u2013 with current and upcoming themes including migration, disabled people\u2019s rights and activism, and environmental action.\nYou can contact collections@phm.org.uk to arrange to visit the museum store, if safe to do so, or to request further information and photographs.\u00a0 The collection can also be accessed online.\nOur long term ambition is to be able to display PHM\u2019s contemporary collection in the main galleries.\u00a0 The museum would love to bring the permanent displays, which currently end around the year 2000, up to the present day reflecting on recent events and changes in history including Brexit, Jo Cox and More in Common, Black Lives Matter, Covid-19, the Scottish referendum and more.\u00a0 Without the contemporary collecting work we are doing now, this won\u2019t be possible.\n\nOnce an object enters the museum collection, it is treated in the same way and goes through the same processes whether it is contemporary or historic. \u00a0Once accessioned into the collection their condition is assessed to determine how they can be used or displayed, they are catalogued in the same way, and they are stored in a way that best suits their materials and design.\u00a0 One consideration is that contemporary items are often made of materials, or using techniques, which present different conservation challenges when compared with historic objects, such as the use of plastic, felt tip pen, cardboard or glitter.\n\nAt this pivotal point in history, when our national healthcare service is being tested and valued like no time before, and when many people are taking collective action for change, we believe there hasn\u2019t been a more crucial time for PHM\u2019s contemporary collecting.\u00a0 The way people campaign and demonstrate, often with ephemeral handmade items, means that these items are likely to be lost if we wait for these events to become \u2018historic\u2019 so it is important that we collect as these socio-political events are taking place.\nHowever, it is also a challenging time financially, not least because of the income affected by the museum building being closed for five months during lockdown.\u00a0 So we are asking people to support us in our contemporary collecting work so that PHM can share these historic moments for current and future generations and tell the stories of the extraordinary changemakers of our world who deserve to be recognised and remembered.\nWe are looking for additional support to cover the costs of transportation, conservation, digitisation and documentation of the contemporary collections coming into PHM\u2019s permanent collection.\u00a0 The behind the scenes work of collecting objects, cataloguing, conserving and caring, storing and displaying or using them, all requires a significant investment of expertise, time and resources. \u00a0As PHM\u2019s collection grows these costs also grow, and support through the Collective Action campaign will make a vital difference to the museum\u2019s ability to care for and provide access to its unique and amazing collection.\nFind out how you can support PHM\u2019s

This month PHM Exhibitions Officer Mark Wilson puts the spotlight on a 200 year old cartoon Universal Suffrage or the Scum Uppermost by George Cruikshank.\nOver last few months the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement has highlighted the relevance and power of mass demonstration and public protest.\u00a0 But the narrative around protest is increasingly shaped by social media and an ever growing number of online news platforms. Despite the increased coverage, the reliability of these news sources has frequently come into question with claims of fake news and\u00a0disinformation becoming\u00a0more and more common place.\u00a0 The current media landscape is very different to that of 200 years ago, however it is interesting to draw parallels with how printed propaganda influenced perceptions of protest movements even back then.\nPolitical and satirical cartoons reached the height of their popularity during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\u00a0 To begin with, satirical prints were only available to upper class collectors.\u00a0 Print shops began to appear everywhere, specialising in single sheet cartoons and publications.\u00a0 The best work was still too expensive for most people, so print shop owners would decorate their windows with the most popular cartoons for everyone to enjoy.\u00a0 Here they found a wider audience amongst the working classes, whose interest in politics and democracy was also growing.\u00a0 Soon cheaper lower quality copies were produced to meet demand and some shops even loaned out prints to taverns for an evening\u2019s entertainment.\nTo modern eyes these prints may look little more than comic drawings but it is important to understand that newspapers at this time almost never included illustrations. \u00a0Caricaturists were almost unrivalled as visual journalists. \u00a0The cartoonist\u2019s use of satire and humour allowed more artistic freedom at a time when the press was greatly restricted. \u00a0Caricaturists were often merciless in their attacks on public figures and politicians, embellishing every detail of the latest scandal. \u00a0It was in part due to their popularity that the printers were rarely ever prosecuted for their libellous content, as the fear was a court case would only generate more publicity. \u00a0Perhaps we can see similarities today with removal of offensive content from social media often only fuelling greater public interest and attention.\n\nGeorge Cruikshank (1792 \u2013 1878) was the son of the noted caricaturist Isaac Cruikshank, he was born during the satirical print\u2019s most fertile period. \u00a0From an early age he was involved in the family business assisting his father with etching plates, drawing background characters or filling in areas of shadow. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t long before he was recognised as an artist in his own right and became renowned for his savage caricatures, eventually replacing James Gillray as the nation\u2019s favourite cartoonist. \u00a0Early in his career Cruikshank achieved great success working with the radical journalist and publisher William Hone. Hone specialised in short illustrated pamphlets which used satire to attack the church and the political establishment. \u00a0These cheaply produced publications employed minimal text and bold black and white wood engraved illustrations. \u00a0Their collaborations proved hugely popular often selling over a 100,000 copies in a matter of months.\nCruikshank worked with many publishers and he was illustrating anti-radical prints at the same time he was working\u00a0with Hone for the reform movement. \u00a0To some extent his motivation was probably financial, print shops that produced full colour etchings paid better money and he could be bought for the right price as the\u00a0\u00a3100\u00a0bribe he accepted to stop caricaturing George IV showed.\nUniversal Suffrage or the Scum Uppermost!! \u00a0was a print commissioned by influential London print shop owner George Humphrey. \u00a0The engraving was produced in July 1819, just one month before the Peterloo Massacre. \u00a0It was designed to warn of the dangers of radical reform and potential revolution. \u00a0Humphrey\u2019s customers were mainly wealthy middle and upper class men, many of whom were anxious about the working classes\u2019 growing demands for the vote. \u00a0The print depicts reform as a multi-headed beast perched atop a smoking mound, made up of the discarded symbols of royalty, religion and the arts.\u00a0 The monster balances a cap of liberty on its tail; an emblem of the French Revolution.\u00a0 The print offers us a window into the attitudes that would directly fuel the events of the Peterloo Massacre on 16 August 1819 in Manchester.\nCruikshank produced many similar anti-reform prints for Humphrey, his motivation may have been largely financial but even he was not immune to Tory propaganda and he was increasing worried about the possibility of bloody revolution in Britain. \u00a0Although he would continue to produce anti-establishment work in the wake of Peterloo, his wavering commitment to reformist cause was noted by his friend William Hone in a letter from 1821, \u2018I have long suspected, that he is by no means friendly to Reform!\u2019\n\nMany believed that Lord Liverpool\u2019s government exaggerated the danger of revolution and even agitated rebellion using agent provocateurs; secret agents that infiltrated the reform movement. \u00a0This is illustrated by the 1817 satirical print published SW Forbes, More Plots!!! More Plots!!! . \u00a0The four sections of the image show different animals accusing their prey of plotting against them. \u00a0In one panel two wolves survey a flock of lambs, speculating \u2018those bloodythirsty wretches mean to destroy man woman & child\u2019.\nThe print is dedicated to Lord Sidmouth and Lord Castlereagh leading members of the government who used the perceived threat of unrest to suspend Habeas Corpus that same year; which allowed people to be detained without trial.\nIn much the same way that the prints of the golden age of caricature influenced public opinion both positively and negatively, social media and online platforms have been found to increasingly shape political discourse.\u00a0 Some would argue they have even affected the outcome of elections and referendums around the world.\u00a0 The sheer volume of content online means it is sometimes hard to separate fact from fiction.\nThe last few months have seen thousands attend mass demonstrations worldwide in support of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and social media has been used to raise awareness of racism and show solidarity with the movement. In addition to this, a battleground has developed online where the backlash against BLM grows,\u00a0with more and more attempts to undermine the movement by spreading of disinformation. \u00a0Some of the most extreme examples can easily be dismissed and traced back to unreliable sources or fake accounts, but their messages seems to have filtered into the narrative of more established news outlets and even that of the US government and\u00a0President Donald Trump, who choose to frame BLM as an anti-white movement and claim anti-fascist protesters are being transported around the country to join protests, cause chaos and destroy property. \u00a0Even in Britain fake protests flyers have been shared on social media which carry inflammatory messages like \u2018Kill\u00a0A white on sight their silence is violence\u2019 and \u2018 White women and Children you are the enemy!\u2019 these dangerous hoaxes play to the fears of those who see the movement as an attack on \u2018British\u2019 history and life. \u00a0It important that we don\u2019t allow this rise in online propaganda to\u00a0discredit such an important international human rights movement and their role in addressing racial inequality.\nThe cartoon is not on public display.\u00a0 It recently featured in PHM\u2019s 2019 exhibition Disrupt? Peterloo and Protest exhibition (23 March 2019 \u2013 23 February 2020).\u00a0 You can find out more about the print and all the ten treasures in PHM\u2019s collection.\nOn Saturday 15 August at

Hero", "author": "", "timestamp": "2020-08-07 00:00:00", "text": "As we approach the anniversary of the Peterloo Massacre next weekend, Robert Poole, Historian and Professor of History at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), reflects on why he chose to be PHM Radical Sponsor of Samuel Bamford, radical reformer and writer who was present at Peterloo.\nMy radical hero is Samuel Bamford (1788-1872), reformer, writer, journalist, poet, diarist, and hero of Peterloo.\u00a0 He is also the best documented working man of the 19th century.\nBamford led the march from Rochdale and Middleton to St Peter\u2019s Field, Manchester on 16 August 1819.\u00a0 He was the most prominent of the reformers prosecuted alongside radical speaker Henry Hunt and played an important role in organising their defence.\u00a0 He very nearly succeeded, but after a furious outburst in court he was sentenced to a year in Lincoln gaol \u2013 the fifth prison he had been in for his political activity.\u00a0 His later memoir, Passages in the Life of a Radical, is one of the best accounts we have of Regency England, described by the late great historian E P Thompson as \u2018essential reading for any Englishman\u2019.\nBamford was a skilled weaver \u2013 first cotton, later silk \u2013 from a Methodist family in the handloom weaving village of Middleton, six miles north of Manchester.\u00a0 He suffered early tragedy, losing his mother and siblings to an outbreak of fever in a Manchester workhouse, where his father was for a time governor.\u00a0 He enjoyed a robust outdoor youth, drinking, fighting, and fathering an illegitimate child, and also attended both Middleton and Manchester grammar schools.\u00a0 He briefly joined the local volunteers during the Napoleonic invasion scare of 1803, but like many patriots he was disillusioned by the long drawn out privations of wartime.\nWhen peace came after Waterloo and hopes for reform rose, Bamford became secretary of the Middleton Hampden Club \u2013 one of several such political campaigning and debating societies formed in England in the early 19th century.\u00a0 He ended up as a delegate to London in January 1817 where he met the orator Henry Hunt, the writer and organiser John Cartwright, and the pamphleteer and journalist William Cobbett, and helped present a mass of reform petitions to parliament.\u00a0 He stayed on to sample London\u2019s radical underworld.\u00a0 Peterloo brought Bamford to the brink of rebellion, but he was fundamentally a radical constitutionalist.\u00a0 He consistently worked to build a broad based mass movement involving whole communities.\u00a0 He led the way in encouraging women to vote at radical meetings, and later persuaded his wife Mima to add her own account of Peterloo to his memoir.\n\nBamford wrote and published many radical poems and songs, and his most rousing anthems were written from prison and sung en masse in his honour.\u00a0 He went on to become a freelance journalist and a supporter of mechanics\u2019 institutes and working class education.\u00a0 His two part biography, Passages in the Life of a Radical and Early Days, published in the Chartist period of the 1830s and 1840s, was admired by prominent writers and politicians of the time, including Charles Dickens, Elizabeth Gaskell, Thomas Carlyle, George Eliot (pen name of Mary Ann Evans), and William Gladstone.\u00a0 Bamford was a pioneer of Lancashire dialect writing, and he loved walking and writing about his native landscape. \u00a0The diaries which he wrote later in life are one of the richest sources we have for Victorian Manchester.\nBamford had his flaws and his feuds.\u00a0 He fell out with fellow reformers and writers and opposed the Chartists, whom he felt had abandoned the politics of progress for the politics of class.\u00a0 He even did his turn of duty as village constable.\u00a0 A sharp detector of flaws in others, he could be vain, ungenerous, and prickly.\u00a0 His judgment was warped by a lifelong fear of spies and informers, and the death of his only daughter in the prime of life hit him badly.\u00a0 It was not easy to be a working class hero in a sharply divided society, chasing success while maintaining integrity and keeping the demons of the past at bay.\nTaking the long view, Bamford rises above it all.\u00a0 Alongside Hunt, he was one of the principal architects of a forceful yet non-violent mass movement for reform \u2013 standing \u2018calm and resolute\u2019 in poet Percy Bysshe Shelley\u2019s words \u2013 looking forward to the civil society and pro-democracy movements of more recent times.\u00a0 Above all there are his writings: memoirs, journalism, fiction, poetry, diaries, all clear-eyed and plainly written.\u00a0 He was born on the eve of the French revolution, lived through the worst of times and the age of reform, and died peacefully in his bed aged 84 in 1872, the year the secret ballot was introduced.\nHe never lived to get the vote but he gets mine; all homage to Samuel Bamford, the radical.\nRobert Poole is Professor of History at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), author of Peterloo: the English Uprising (2019), co-author of the graphic novel Peterloo: Witnesses to a Massacre (2019), and co-editor of The Diaries of Samuel Bamford (2000).\u00a0 His biography of Bamford has been on its way for 20 years.\nLike Bamford, there are many stories of radical thinkers told throughout the museum and many more to be explored.\u00a0 People\u2019s History Museum is proud to tell the story of ideas worth fighting for, including the stories of radical thinkers whose big ideas have shaped our society.\nAs a charity, People\u2019s History Museum relies on

00:00:00", "text": "While the museum is closed we\u2019re taking the time to explore some of the treasures within People\u2019s History Museum\u2019s (PHM) collection and their relevance today.\u00a0 This month PHM Learning Officer Liz Thorpe puts the spotlight on the Cliff Rowe painting Woman Looking Through a Microscope (1966), and shares activities to improve our wellbeing inspired by PHM\u2019s wider collection of Cliff Rowe paintings.\nBritish artist and illustrator, Clifford Hooper Rowe (1904-1989) was a politically active artist; in the early 1930s he made designs for publications by the Communist Party of Great Britain (of which he was a member), and spent 18 months travelling and working in Soviet Russia.\u00a0 In 1934 he helped establish the Artists\u2019 International Association whose work included helping refugees from Hitler\u2019s Germany and providing medical aid to the British International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War.\u00a0 Rowe donated many of his works to PHM in 1985.\nA lifelong socialist, Rowe sought to achieve a more socially relevant art. \u00a0His work reflects the dominant themes of industry, working life, and people.\nRowe was influenced by socialist realism, a style that came out of the Soviet Union from the 1920s, and emphasised how the hard work of the labourer was helping the nation. \u00a0Rowe married socialist realism with a modernist approach to pattern and abstraction, creating a style that is easily identifiable with new ideas and concepts from the time. \u00a0This can be seen in a lot of Rowe\u2019s large scale and powerful oil paintings, which are icons to the worker, and stress the social value of work.\n\nWoman Looking Through a Microscope which was painted in 1966 feels of particular significance as countries around the world race to find a vaccine for Covid-19. \u00a0When we look closely our eye is first drawn to the composure and calmness that the job in hand is carried out with.\u00a0 Taking in the whole picture you can see this happening amid the pressure of a busy work environment. \u00a0As the viewer you can feel the weight of the task in hand seemingly more than the worker does. \u00a0Rowe depicts different kinds of jobs as equally important, awarding the same grace and hard working character to all. \u00a0For example, Hospital Laundry Workers (date unknown), another painting that resonates with today and the role of key workers, celebrates the working class while also reminding us of why work can be so exhausting.\n\nPeople have been at the forefront of conversations during the Covid-19 pandemic, from front line workers to people \u2018doing their bit\u2019 by staying at home, but as we enter another month many people in and out of work are beginning to feel fatigue.\n\nRowe\u2019s attention to the labouring workforce also extends to their home life. \u00a0In paintings such as Woman with Birdcage in Window (1931), he depicts people removed from the pressures of the work environment where life appears ground to a halt, almost paused.\u00a0 Many of these paintings represent solitary figures or small groups of people partaking in simple activities.\u00a0 We see for example, a woman staring longingly out of her window, a child playing with a skipping rope or a couple relaxing in the park.\nIn the current situation the lack of work has been equally exhausting for some people, the weight of financial worries, isolation and lack of purpose can take its toll. \u00a0We must make sure we are supporting each other as the pressure on our mental health can often be hidden.\nWhether we are unable to work, on furlough leave, returning to work or have been working throughout, it is important to take time to talk together about our experiences.\u00a0 Being disconnected from friends, family, colleagues, students and teachers can be isolating, but there will also be many shared experiences that can bring comfort as we head to a \u2018new normal\u2019.\n\nIn the painting Man Leaning Over Woman (date unknown), we are presented with a scene that might be familiar to many \u2013 a couple relaxing in a park. \u00a0We can only see their immediate surroundings which give the impression of isolation and yet this could be a busy park beyond the frame. \u00a0Many people took advantage of their local area at the beginning of lockdown, be it in the city or the countryside, rediscovering old hobbies and spending more time with those in their household. \u00a0While lockdown measures are starting to relax it is important that we continue to take some time out and be creative to help us to manage the stresses of living in these uncertain times.\nHere are some simple communication activities that can help to reduce anxiety.\u00a0 Part of PHM\u2019s Ideas Worth Exploring at home and online offer, we\u2019ve also designed some new activities inspired by Cliff Rowe\u2019s paintings, to encourage you to take time out for yourself, your family and friends.\n\nA recurring theme in many of Rowe\u2019s paintings, as in Sorting Tobacco Leaves (date unknown), is the focus on one worker in what is most likely a large scale, busy production line. \u00a0The block of colour behind their head appears almost like a spotlight, drawing focus to their face rather than the work their hands are doing, making us pay attention to the person rather than the task.\nSome of us have been presented with a unique opportunity to slow down and reflect on our old work life balance. \u00a0The pressure of targets, deadlines and exams can be immense. \u00a0While we may not be able to change the demand for these, we can make sure we make time for our collective wellbeing. \u00a0Talking about what is needed to support our mental health \u2013 be it finding outlets for creativity, training opportunities, and having support systems in place \u2013 could have a really positive and lasting legacy.\nGive your friends, family, team or class space to talk about their experiences and how they feel about the current situation. \u00a0Talking out loud can help people to make sense of many thoughts and feelings.\nYou may find before starting conversations it helps to convey that you are in a safe space and anything discussed within the activity will stay between those participating and will not be repeated, so individuals feel safe and confident expressing their feelings.\nYou may also find small groups are less intimidating and each person will need a set amount of time to talk, uninterrupted while everyone else listens.\n\nEncourage talking about:\n\n\nIdentifying shared experiences can help bring people together after a long period of absence. \u00a0It may also help individuals to see that while they have a unique set of circumstances they are not on their own or the only ones to feel a certain way.\u00a0 Identify one end of a shared space as \u2018strongly disagree\u2019 and the other end as \u2018strongly agree\u2019. \u00a0For each of the following statements ask your group to place themselves between the two ends in response.\nIf this is difficult to do while socially distancing, draw a line on a large piece of paper and ask participants to circle on the line where their opinion falls, if possible, using a different colour pen for each statement to separate the answers:\n\nResponses to these statements may prompt further group discussion.\n\nYou can see much of PHM\u2019s Cliff Rowe collection on Art UK\u2019s website, the online home for every public art collection in the UK.\nCliff Rowe was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, the complete holdings of which are held in the museum\u2019s archive for researchers to view.\nWe believe that collecting material on events happening now is vital for PHM to tell the continuing story of ideas worth fighting for, including how Covid-19 has impacted experiences of disability and working life.\u00a0 If you have any objects, photographs or videos you think can help us tell this story and build PHM\u2019s collection, please get in touch at collections@phm.org.uk.\n"}, {"link":

anniversary of the day the match girls went out on strike, Sam Johnson, great granddaughter of Sarah Chapman, one of the leaders of the 1888 strike details the strike and uncovers Sarah\u2019s personal story and Sam\u2019s mission for her unmarked grave.\nAt the Bryant & May match factory in Bow, east London, many workers were very young girls and women, working long hours for little pay, with fines for petty offences. \u00a0They also had to work with dangerous white phosphorus that could cause a form of cancer known as \u2018phossy jaw\u2019. \u00a0Unrest was mounting and then came an unexpected external spark. \u00a0On 15 June 1888, at a Fabian Society meeting, Henry Hyde Champion reported 20% dividends at the factory while workers got \u2018starvation wages\u2019. \u00a0He proposed a boycott on Bryant & May matches, which was passed unanimously.\nAnnie Besant (1847-1933), a prominent social reformer and Fabian, met with some workers outside the factory to find out more about their conditions, which led to her article, White Slavery in London in the newspaper\u00a0The Link\u00a0(23 June 1888). \u00a0Bryant & May were furious and tried to cover up the allegations by forcing their workers to sign false statements. \u00a0They refused.\nThe final straw was a dismissal of one of the girls at the factory \u2013 1,400 girls and women walked out on strike, on 5 July 1888.\u00a0 They wrote to Annie:\n\u2018My Dear Lady, \u2013 we thank you very much for the kind interest you have taken in us poor girls, and hope that you will succeed in your undertakings. \u00a0Dear lady, you need not trouble yourself about the letter I read in the Link that Mr. Bryant sent you, because you have spoken the truth, and we are very pleased to read it. \u00a0Dear lady, they are trying to get the poor girls to say that it is all lies that has been printed, and trying to make them sign papers to say it is lies; dear lady, no one knows what we have to put up with, and we will not sign them. \u00a0We all thank you very much for the kindness you have shown to us. \u00a0My dear lady, we hope you will not get into any trouble in our behalf, as what you have spoken is quite true; dear lady, we hope that if there will be any meeting we hope you will let us know it in the book. \u00a0I have no more to say at present, from yours truly, with kind friends wishes for you, dear lady, for the kind love you have shown us poor girls. \u00a0Dear lady do not mention the date this letter was written or I might have put my or our names, but we are frightened, do keep that as a secret, we know you will do that dear lady.\u2019\nThe next day 200 workers marched to Annie\u2019s office in Bouverie Street, London, where The Link was published\n\u2018You had spoke up for us and we weren\u2019t going back on you\u2019\nAnnie Besant spoke to three of them and, despite not favouring strike action, agreed to help.\u00a0 Plans were made for a strike committee.\nThe first members of the committee were Sarah Chapman, Mrs Mary Cummings, Mary Driscoll, Alice Francis, Eliza Martin, Mrs Mary Naulls, Kate Sclater and Jane Wakeling.\nThe strikers held their first meeting on Mile End Waste, a large open space frequently used for such gatherings..\u00a0 Some newspapers provided positive publicity and MPs started to listen, which led to Annie Besant taking a deputation of match girls to parliament to meet two MPs.\u00a0 On a wave of optimism and courage, in just under a fortnight, the Match Girls\u2019 Strike Committee, supported by the London Trades Council, met with Bryant & May. \u00a0All the strike demands were met \u2013 a momentous victory for workers\u2019 and women\u2019s rights. \u00a0The news was greeted by \u2018wild cheering\u2019.\nThe inaugural meeting of the Union of Women Matchmakers took place at Stepney Meeting Hall and 12 women were officially elected to the committee:\nLouisa Beck, Sarah Chapman, Mary Driscoll, Alice Francis, Julia Gamelton, Ellen Johnson, Eliza Martin, Mrs Mary Naulls, Eliza Price, Kate Sclater, Jane Staines and Jane Wakeling.\nSarah Dearman (n\u00e9e Chapman) was my Great Grandmother.\u00a0 It was only in 2016 that I discovered how brave and historically important she was, thanks to Dr Anna Robinson\u2019s MA thesis, \u2018Neither Hidden Nor Condescended To: Overlooking Sarah Chapman\u2018.\nSarah was born in 1862 in Mile End, east London and at least by the time she was 19, was a matchmaking machinist. \u00a0So why do I assert her as one of the strike leaders?\nShe was one of the delegation of three who met with Annie Besant after the match girls marched to her office on Bouverie Street, and she was on the strike committee, so she was almost certainly in the delegation that met MPs and would have discussed terms with Bryant & May at the end of the strike.\n\nSignificantly, Sarah was elected to the new Union Committee and was their first representative to the International Trades Union Congress (TUC) in November 1888; a sign that she was highly regarded by others.\u00a0 She attended with Annie Besant and was one of only 77 delegates.\u00a0 As one of only 10 women out of almost 500 delegates, she also attended the 1890 TUC conference in Liverpool and seconded a motion related to The Truck Act.\nIn 1891 Sarah left the factory and married Charles Dearman.\u00a0 They had six children, three of whom predeceased Sarah.\u00a0 She lived to see women get the vote, and survived the Blitz, but ended up in a pauper\u2019s grave in Manor Park Cemetery & Crematorium, east London at the end of 1945.\n\nThanks to Anna Robinson, I found Sarah\u2019s unmarked grave in 2017.\u00a0 Devastatingly, it is threatened with \u2018mounding\u2019 \u2013 a brutal process where mechanical diggers flatten the ground, new soil is added and new burials made; risking disturbing existing remains.\u00a0 We have funds for a headstone (thanks to donations from Unite the Union and GMB union) and an active campaign to stop the mounding so we can erect her headstone.\nTo recognise the match girls\u2019 contribution to the advancing of human rights, equality and workers\u2019 rights, we have a charity,

\u2018essential\u2019 | histories of migrant workers in PHM\u2019s collection", "author": "", "timestamp": "2020-06-17 00:00:00", "text": "Earlier this month we shared a blog post that put the spotlight on a Grunwick strike (1976-1978) poster from People\u2019s History Museum\u2019s (PHM) collection and looked at its relevance today.\u00a0 Here PHM\u2019s Researcher Dr Shirin Hirsch takes a closer look at the history of migrant workers documented in the museum\u2019s collection.\n\u2018\u2026the outside history that is inside the history of the English.\u2019\nAs Stuart Hall, the great black sociologist, once put it there was no English history without that \u2018other\u2019 history.\u00a0 Migrants were not simply newly injected into the country when the Windrush ship docked on Tilbury Docks in 1948 but instead were integral to the internal dynamics of British society over a much longer period.\u00a0 Even for those who did not migrate, the labour power of colonial workers had long entered the economic blood stream of Britain.\u00a0 This history has been repressed, yet the current pandemic has, through crisis, exposed the mobile and unequal fibres of our society as part of a much longer history of colonialism and racism.\u00a0 Within this, the key role of migrant workers is revealed, transformed from \u2018unskilled\u2019 to \u2018essential\u2019 workers.\nThis year at PHM we are rethinking how we see this global British history through our programme theme exploring migration, which includes our Community Programme Team planning a series of \u2018interventions\u2019 into our main gallery spaces.\u00a0 The museum\u2019s collection holds many documents and objects that tell the stories of workers from our past.\u00a0 Some of these workers were born in the area in which they worked, some moved from countryside to city while others crossed national borders and even oceans.\u00a0 Working class histories are deeply connected with global networks of people in perpetual motion.\u00a0 The museum\u2019s collection reflects this movement, weaving stories of Empire, race and migration into the democratic struggles of working people, past and present.\u00a0 Here I want to briefly showcase a few items from the collection that tell a collective and mobile story of work and resistance.\nThe trade union banners in the collection show some of these chains binding the fate of workers from the colonies to Britain.\u00a0 Through rich decoration and symbols, the banners offer clues to many of the political ideas within the British labour movement.\u00a0 The rise of trade union banners produced by professional banner makers like George Tutill came about at a time when a particular type of skilled, respectable trade union had moved into the open and were beginning to be taken seriously by the British state with the wave of New Model Unions in the 1850s.\u00a0 The banners commissioned reflected this newfound relative wealth and organisation with displays of strong union men protecting women from harm, decorated in patriotic Union Jacks.\u00a0 This was also a period in which the British Empire was reaping the wealth of its colonies under Queen Victoria, and an attachment to the Empire is sometimes visibly expressed through these banners.\n\nYou can see the threads of Empire in this Dockers Union banner, where trade with the British Empire is shown as central to the union, with the elephant representing British India next to the docker.\u00a0 This was a union formed out of the New Union period of the late 1800s, a trade union movement that rejected the elitism of past unions, yet the relationship to Empire is still complicated with colonial wealth flowing through the docks.\u00a0 The dockers were often described as \u2018unskilled\u2019 and, like the match girls who had sparked the New Union strike wave, were often from Irish backgrounds.\u00a0 In this period such Irish workers were racialised as savage and criminal elements of the working class, and their central involvement in the union shows the tensions in any idea of a \u2018white\u2019 working class movement.\u00a0 Race and the framing of \u2018unskilled\u2019 labour forcefully coalesced.\nBy the 20th century there were growing communities of sailors, slaves and pirates, the \u2018motley crew\u2019 at sea, that were now beginning to settle in port cities and towns in Britain.\u00a0 They built on earlier histories of black workers in Britain, like the tailor and Chartist leader William Cuffay, and the cabinet maker and radical William Davidson.\u00a0 The museum tells these histories within the museum\u2019s collection, and in the archive we are lucky to hold a recently acquired collection documenting the life of the black engineer Thomas Bangbala.\u00a0 He was born in Nigeria in 1907 and at the age of 17 travelled to Liverpool as a Seaman.\u00a0 A few years later he began to study as an electrical engineer and moved to Manchester in 1928.\u00a0 In 1940 Bangbala joined the Electrical Trade Union, becoming the first black man to join the Manchester branch.\u00a0 He was an active Labour Party member and a campaigner against racism, attendee at the hugely significant fifth Pan African Congress of 1945 held in Manchester.\u00a0 Bangbala\u2019s life as an engineer was not separate to, but integrated into his political activism in Manchester.\n\nAlthough we have few of these individual personal collections, there are still traces of black workers in British society, like the main image, a print by the communist artist Cliff Rowe of a black Air Raid Precautions (ARP) warden during World War II. He looks serious and proud in his official wartime uniform, but we don\u2019t know his name and can only imagine his role within the war and his life in Britain.\nAfter the war, those from the Commonwealth were encouraged to Britain to help rebuild the country.\u00a0 \u2018Welcome Home!\u2019 read the Evening Standard headline on the arrival of the Windrush ship in 1948, the newspaper greeting the \u2018400 sons of Empire\u2019.\u00a0 Colonial subjects were integral to the rebuilding of British society, but they were not simply subservient or passive workers.\u00a0 Unlike Thomas Bangbala, who was allowed to join the union partly because of his active role with the local Labour Party, many black workers were excluded from trade union organisation and there were often separate strikes of black and white workers in the same workplace in the post war years.\u00a0 The Grunwick strike, however, challenged these divisions; a failed strike in its immediate demands, but one in which migrant workers, those who had often migrated not once but twice, from India to East Africa, to West London, were leading the way in trade union struggle between 1976 and 1978.\u00a0 These workers brought with them radical ways of organising and challenged racist divisions that had far too often determined the trade union movement.\n\nRather than detaching these histories of migrant workers as a separate other, the museum\u2019s collection shows the ongoing role of migrants within working class struggle, and in the making and remaking of British society.\u00a0 These struggles continue today, illuminated through the life of Belly Mujinga.\u00a0 Mujinga was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and migrated to Britain in 2000.\u00a0 She was a railway ticket officer in London, refused personal protective equipment (PPE) by her employers, and spat at while on duty at work before falling ill and finally dying of coronavirus on 5 April 2020.\u00a0 Her family have yet to receive any form of justice, with British Transport Police (BTP) initially stating no further action would be taken.\u00a0 Mujinga\u2019s tragic death points to the disposable ways in which such workers are treated by the British state.\u00a0 PHM\u2019s collection points to a different way of viewing black and migrant workers, removed from narrow nationalistic frameworks, and instead understood as essential to who we are within a moving and connected world.\nAt PHM we are continually building on the collection, and we would love to add more to represent the work of migrants and BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) history over the last 200 years.\u00a0 If you have any objects or archives you think would be an important addition to the museum\u2019s collection, please email collections@phm.org.uk.\n"}, {"link": "https://phm.org.uk/blogposts/going-back-to-grunwick/", "category": "", "title": "Going back to Grunwick", "author": "", "timestamp": "2020-06-10 00:00:00", "text": "Whilst the museum is closed we\u2019re taking the time to explore some of the treasures within People\u2019s History Museum\u2019s (PHM) collection and their relevance today. \u00a0This month PHM\u2019s Programme Officer, Zofia Kufeldt puts the spotlight on a Grunwick strike poster from 1977. \u00a0This beautifully hand drawn poster was used to publicise a meeting held by Bethnal Green and Stepney Trades Council in London during the Grunwick strike of 1976 to 1978.\n\nThe Grunwick strike (1976-1978) is an important moment in the storytelling of the national museum of democracy, not only because of the action taken by workers, but because it marks a particularly significant chapter of history concerning anti-racism.\nWorkers at the Grunwick film processing factory in north west London were protesting against their treatment by managers and seeking trade union recognition.\u00a0 The strike was led by Jayaben Desai, who like many of the protesting workers was a migrant from east Africa. \u00a0Although the strike was unsuccessful, Grunwick is remembered for how thousands of workers of different genders and ethnicities united to defend the rights of migrant workers in the face of inequality, discrimination and injustice.\n\nUnlike previous disputes involving black and Asian workers, the Grunwick strike received trade union support and workers from across Britain showed solidarity. \u00a0At the strike\u2019s peak around 20,000 people joined the picket line. \u00a0The two year picket was possible because the strikers received strike pay from the trade union which was comparable to the low pay they received at the Grunwick factory. \u00a0Long term, the impact of the strike improved conditions and the recognition of migrant workers. \u00a0It also transformed the role of Asian women in trade unions and in Britain.\nToday, during the Covid-19 pandemic, the strike seems more relevant than ever. \u00a0The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) highlights that the majority of frontline workers in the UK are women, whilst workers from a black, Asian or ethnic minority background are overrepresented in the health service in Britain. \u00a0Although the context has changed since the Grunwick strike, many workers are still facing race, class and gender injustices whilst carrying out their work; it is more urgent and important than ever to listen to their concerns and defend their rights.\n\nCovid-19 has highlighted that the British economy, particularly the NHS and care systems, cannot function without the contributions made by migrant workers. \u00a0Throughout history the UK has relied on migrant labour, particularly in its essential industries. \u00a0UK governments have often encouraged migrants into the country, as they bring economic benefit, but legislation has often forced these migrants into low paid and essential services regardless of their previous experience.\nMy grandfather came to Britain in World War II. \u00a0Connected to the armed forces and unable to return to Poland, he was allowed to stay and work under the Polish Resettlement Act of 1947. \u00a0Through the resettlement programme he was restricted to working in certain industries which were most hit by shortages. \u00a0He undertook agricultural work and worked on the railways before taking up a job in the cotton industry. \u00a0Like many of the migrant workers involved in the Grunwick strike, many Poles who were resettled were highly qualified and found it hard to translate their skills and status into equivalent jobs and lifestyles in their new environments.\nCovid-19 has emphasised our reliance on migrant workers and the essential services that they provide. \u00a0Viral videos and social media have shown that people are beginning to think about migrants differently. \u00a0The video #YouClapForMeNow, featuring key workers from a mix of different ethnic backgrounds, including first, second and third generation migrants reciting a poem illustrating the difficulties they face in the UK, triggered an outpouring of thanks to immigrants in the UK and went viral worldwide. \u00a0Another viral video of Syrian refugee and NHS worker Hassan Akkad resulted in a U-turn on the NHS surcharge for migrant health workers, and saw the NHS coronavirus bereavement scheme extended to low paid workers.\nHowever, immigration is a controversial political topic and whilst there has been a recent shift towards acknowledgement and gratitude, inequalities still remain and the Windrush scandal in 2018 shows how quickly the contribution of migrants to society and the economy can be forgotten.\u00a0 How Britain\u2019s relationship with migration develops long term is still yet to be seen with many migrant key workers fearing their pay will fall below the Home Office income requirement.\nWe\u2019d like to hear what you think about these issues. \u00a0How is the pandemic influencing perceptions and ideas on migration? \u00a0What do you think needs to change? \u00a0Share your ideas and comments with us on social media using #PHMHaveYourSay.\nWe believe that collecting material on events happening now is vital for PHM to tell the continuing story of ideas worth fighting for, including how Covid-19 has impacted and influenced responses to and experiences of migration.\nIf you have any objects,

\u2018There Is No Planet B\u2019 placard.\nIn this post, Programme Officer Michael Powell shares one of the museum\u2019s most recent acquisitions collected from the very first Youth Climate Strike in Manchester in 2019.\u00a0 He looks at how campaigning has gone online, asks whether we can now look forward to a greener future and explains how you can help document the ideas worth fighting for today.\nIn 2019 People\u2019s History Museum (PHM) spent the year exploring the theme of protest in commemoration of the bicentenary of the Peterloo Massacre. \u00a0Our audiences talked a lot about environmental protest, reflecting what was happening and concerning them in the wider world.\u00a0 The \u2018There Is No Planet B\u2019 placard was collected at the first Youth Climate Strike in Manchester, which was held on 15 February 2019.\u00a0 The reverse of the placard reads \u2018If you don\u2019t act like adults we will\u2019.\n22 April 2020 marked the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, a time when people would usually have gathered together to celebrate the planet and amplify environmental issues. \u00a0The Covid-19 outbreak meant that celebrations looked very different this year.\u00a0 Previously, millions of children and young people marched for climate action, but this year the streets were empty and public spaces deserted. \u00a0Although children and young people are staying home, they\u2019re continuing to make their voices heard as they move the #ClimateStrikeOnline.\nThe pandemic has also brought many people closer to, and more appreciative of, our natural world. \u00a0Recent weeks have been a testing time for our wellbeing and mental health, but for many people, a locked down society has been a chance to explore nature as a source of hope and comfort during this difficult period.\nAlthough climate breakdown and Covid-19 are two very different challenges, they do have some key things in common. \u00a0Both are global \u2013 they do not respect national boundaries \u2013 and both require countries to work together, sharing scientific research to find solutions.\nRecent weeks have shown that things can change quickly. \u00a0The global community has demonstrated that it can act to address a crisis, with governments, businesses and individuals taking measures and changing behaviors in response to the pandemic.\nThis response has also amplified human kindness as something inherent within us all, especially in a time of crisis. \u00a0This has been shown not only by key workers, who have been risking their lives to save others, but also through the mutual aid provided by millions of people who are supporting friends, family and strangers. \u00a0When we work together, even small personal actions like social distancing, can make a huge difference and help us to overcome great challenges.\nOur elected leaders now face decisions about how to ensure that countries economically recover from the pandemic. \u00a0This presents a huge opportunity for society to shift into a greener economy. \u00a0The question is, will our elected leaders have the vision and spirit to make major changes now that could secure a greener future?\nWe believe that collecting material on events happening now is vital for us to tell the continuing story of ideas worth fighting for. \u00a0Over the last few years, we have been working to collect and document people\u2019s responses to the climate breakdown and now we would especially like this also to represent how Covid-19 has impacted and influenced these responses.\nIf you have any objects,

"2020-04-10 00:00:00", "text": "On the anniversary of the 1848 Chartist mass meeting on Kennington Common, London, People\u2019s History Museum\u2019s (PHM) Researcher Dr Shirin Hirsch explores the life of PHM Radical William Cuffay \u2013 a \u2018scion\u2019 of Africa\u2019s oppressed race \u2013 and reveals a precious, rare and poetic treasure of Cuffay\u2019s from the museum\u2019s collection.\nWorking class radicals from our past are very rarely remembered within our public sphere \u2013 there are few monuments to their feats and their personal collections feature little within the official archives.\u00a0 William Cuffay was one of these working class radicals, preserving no diary, autobiography or papers and his lack of wealth and power leaving only faint traces of his life to explore.\u00a0 Cuffay died a pauper in a workhouse in Tasmania, was buried with no name chiselled into a gravestone, and he had no surviving children (his only daughter died soon after the death of his second wife in childbirth).\u00a0 His homes in London and Tasmania, as well as the workhouse where he died, have long since been demolished.\u00a0 Yet Cuffay\u2019s contributions to the struggles for working class democracy within the British Empire are immense.\u00a0 In this blog I want to think about some of the sources connected to Cuffay, including a precious belonging of Cuffay\u2019s we are honoured to hold at People\u2019s History Museum.\nWilliam Cuffay was the descendent of slaves; his grandfather had been sold into slavery from Africa to St Kitts, and his father was born into slavery. \u00a0Somehow, Cuffay\u2019s father was freed, and he found work as a cook on a warship where he eventually ended up in the dockyard town of Chatham, near London, and married a local. \u00a0William Cuffay was born in 1788, a boy \u2018of a very delicate constitution\u2019, with his spine and shins deformed. \u00a0Cuffay became a tailor, yet on joining a trade union and participating in a strike he was sacked from a job he had held for many years. \u00a0In 1839 Cuffay joined the great working class Chartist movement with its national demands for universal male suffrage and democratic change, and before long he had emerged as one of the most prominent leaders of the Chartist movement in London.\n1848 was a year in which people took to the streets and revolutions broke out across Europe \u2013 it was also a pivotal year for the Chartists in Britain. \u00a0Cuffay was one of the delegates to the Chartists\u2019 national convention, with their main task to prepare a mass meeting on Kennington Common in Lambeth, south London, that would proceed to march and submit a mass petition to parliament. \u00a0Cuffay made some of the most radical speeches at this convention and openly denounced the leading Chartists who were more cautious. \u00a0He was appointed chairman of the committee for managing the procession, responsible for making sure that \u2018everything\u2026necessary for conduction of an immense procession with order and regularity had been adopted\u2019. \u00a0As Cuffay argued, things had now come to a crisis and they must be prepared to act with coolness and responsibility.\n\nIn the above early photograph, you can see the crowds meeting on Kennington Common \u2013 this is the oldest surviving image of a protest in British history. \u00a0Although we cannot see Cuffay, the image is a great representation of his collective and organised spirit. \u00a0Such crowds brought panic to the British state and fears of revolution, so much so that the royal family were sent to the Isle of Wight for their safety. \u00a0The state used all their power to intimidate and halt the crowd\u2019s march to parliament, declaring the procession illegal and with all government buildings prepared for attack. \u00a0Even the British Museum was provided with 50 muskets and 100 cutlasses \u2013 I\u2019d like to think People\u2019s History Museum would instead have been on the Chartist side, had we existed then! \u00a0The bridges were sealed off and guarded by thousands of police and soldiers, while steamboats with troops waited on the River Thames nearby. \u00a0With so much pressure, the Chartist leader Feargus O\u2019Connor agreed to call off the mass procession. \u00a0As Cuffay noted, the Chartist executive had shrunk from their responsibility.\nAngered at this step down, there are unreliable reports from police spies on Cuffay\u2019s involvement with an armed uprising, and on this basis he was tried for \u2018sedition\u2019.\u00a0 Cuffay pleaded not guilty and in the court transcripts we can hear how he demanded that, rather than a middle class jury, he had a \u2018fair trial by my peers\u2019. \u00a0Cuffay powerfully stated that the jury \u2018were not my equals \u2013 I am only a journeyman mechanic\u2019.\u00a0 Reporting on the trial, The Times sneeringly referred to Cuffay and the Chartists as \u2018the black man and his party\u2019, going on to describe Cuffay using hideous racism. \u00a0Cuffay and his two comrades were sentenced to transportation \u2018for the term of your natural lives\u2019.\nChartism effectively died at Kennington Common and with the repression that followed, but the networks of solidarity remained. \u00a0As Cuffay set sail on the prison ship for Tasmania in 1849 he was gifted a beautiful book of Lord Byron\u2019s poetry. \u00a0On the inside page of the book you can see the handwritten note: \u2018Presented to William Cuffay, by the members of the Westminster Branch of the National Charter Association of Great Britain, as a token of their sincere regard and affection for his genuine patriotism and moral worth\u2019.\n\n\nThe book travelled from the docks in Woolwich to the shores of Tasmania, remaining with Cuffay until his death and kept for some years after at the workhouse, before, for some reason travelling to South Africa and then losing any kind of home. \u00a0It was only because of the work of the Chartist historian Professor Malcolm Chase that the book was saved and donated to People\u2019s History Museum in 2014. \u00a0What a journey this book has taken, reflecting the twists and turns of this black radical, and the sacrifices Cuffay made for a global cause. \u00a0Despite Cuffay\u2019s inspirational role, his militancy as well as his black skin and disability, earned him harsh victimisation by the British state. \u00a0In Cuffay\u2019s speech from the dock, he explained: \u2018I have been taunted by the press, and it has tried to smother me with ridicule and it has done everything in its power to crush me\u2019. \u00a0Perhaps they were angered that Cuffay, a black man drawn from the imperial diaspora to challenge the British Empire at its heart, had been repeatedly elected as their representative by fellow Chartists. \u00a0Cuffay eventually found himself exiled to another part of the British Empire where he continued to organise and agitate amongst the working poor. \u00a0His life refused to fit into narrow and nationalistic understandings, but instead pushes us to think of a truly international working class.\nIt is the words of another Chartist that best sum up Cuffay: \u2018loved by his own order, who knew him and appreciated his virtues, ridiculed and denounced by a press that knew him not, and had no sympathy with his class, and banished by a government that feared him\u2026Whilst integrity in the midst of poverty, whilst honour in the midst of temptation are admired and venerated, so long will the name of William Cuffay, a scion of Afric\u2019s oppressed race, be preserved from oblivion\u2019.\n\nLike William Cuffay, there are many stories of radicals told throughout the museum.\u00a0\u00a0For the museum\u2019s 10th birthday year, it is seeking individuals or organisations to become the Radical Sponsors of ten radical men and women including William Cuffay, as part of PHM\u2019s broader Join the Radicals campaign.\u00a0\u00a0Sponsorship is \u00a33,000 and funds raised directly support the museum\u2019s collections, exhibitions and Learning Programme.\nYou can help

and\u00a0Co-operative Party\u00a0politician and a member of the\u00a0House of Lords\u00a0shares his very personal reasons for choosing to be the PHM Radical Sponsor of Jayaben Desai.\u00a0\u00a0We end the blog with ways you can support the museum.\n\u2018The 1970s was a momentous decade for the Labour Party and trade union movement, starting with the miners\u2019 strikes and ending with the defeat of a Labour government.\u00a0\u00a0In the middle of this was the Grunwick strike at a film processing factory in Dollis Hill, in the London suburb of Willesden.\nI was a young community activist in Brighton at that point helping unemployed and homeless people and living as a squatter.\u00a0\u00a0I was trying to find my way in the world. Many young people of my age were horrified by the rise of the National Front, the so called National Federation for Freedom, and the emergence of rightwing ideologies determined to undermine collectivist politics and attack trade unions and work place protections.\nThe Grunwick dispute brought all these elements together as Britain\u2019s rightwing press rallied behind George Ward, the owner of the Grunwick factory.\u00a0\u00a0The dispute was about unfair and discriminatory pay and had the backing of the moderate APEX union and its parliamentary representatives.\nMany trade union and community activists sought to put the strike in a broader context of a predominantly black workforce organising and reaching out for support across the whole labour movement.\u00a0\u00a0It was a test too of the rule of law.\u00a0\u00a0George Ward should never have been allowed to flout reasonable legislation to arbitrate and find a solution to the dispute \u2013 but he did.\nThe strike threw up many dilemmas for trade unionists at the time.\u00a0\u00a0Was mass picketing the right course, should legal channels have been exhausted first, should the Labour government have been firmer in its resolve and much more?\u00a0\u00a0Why was more not being done to protect vulnerable non-unionised workforces, especially black workers in the work place?\nIn the middle of all this was this truly inspirational woman Jayaben Desai.\u00a0\u00a0She was genuinely remarkable.\u00a0\u00a0Diminutive in stature but an immensely impressive figure who was determined to stand up for the Grunwick workforce and to the bullying management, particularly George Ward the owner.\nI identified with the strikers at Grunwick on both an emotional and personal level.\u00a0\u00a0My mother was a farm worker and for most of my childhood and teenage years had suffered from discriminatory pay rates.\u00a0\u00a0She earned 60% of the male farm workers\u2019 pay rates, but worked just as hard as they did.\u00a0\u00a0The manifest unfairness of it made me very angry.\u00a0\u00a0I persuaded my mum to join the agricultural workers\u2019 union, so at least she had some help and advice.\u00a0\u00a0The farm grew and packed soft fruit plants (mostly strawberries) for mail order.\u00a0\u00a0The owner got rich and largely at the expense of his female workforce.\nThe 1970 Equal Pay Act wasn\u2019t well enforced and the farm owner used various ruses to keep pay low among his mostly female employees.\nJayaben Desai rallied her workplace to fight back, and what impressed all of us who joined the picket line was the breadth of support she built and the passion for social justice she captured.\u00a0\u00a0She earned the respect of all who encountered her.\u00a0\u00a0She was uncompromising when that was the right thing to be and made her case to often unsympathetic audiences.\nNobody could forget the sight of her walking up and down the picket line in her sari urging her colleagues to stand firm or berating very politely the police for defending the indefensible.\u00a0\u00a0It brought tears to the eyes of many including myself.\u00a0\u00a0When the dispute finally led to the defeat of those involved her dignity and determination still shone through.\nAlthough the strike failed in its primary objective, it did represent a turning point in the development of black workforce unionisation.\u00a0\u00a0It made a big statement in terms of the need to develop unity across racial divides in the workplace at a time when organised labour needed to recognise that issue.\nOn a personal level it inspired a generation of activists like me to work in the Labour Party and broader movement for social change.\u00a0\u00a0It showed our strengths and weaknesses and demonstrated how big an impact an inspiring leader and organiser such as Jayaben Desai can have on people to change our world.\u2019\nLike Jayaben, there are many stories of radical women and men told throughout the museum.\u00a0\u00a0For the museum\u2019s 10th birthday year, it is seeking to sign up nine more people or organisations to become Radical Sponsors as part of PHM\u2019s broader Join the Radicals campaign.\u00a0\u00a0Sponsorship is \u00a33,000 and funds raised go directly to support the museum\u2019s collections, exhibitions and Learning Programme.\nLike Steve, you can help the museum continue to celebrate and commemorate those people who campaign for ideas worth fighting for and sponsor:\n\nBecoming a Radical Sponsor is just one of the ways people can get involved in supporting the museum.

00:00:00", "text": "People\u2019s History Museum (PHM) houses the world\u2019s largest collection of trade union and political banners. \u00a0In this month\u2019s blog, our Conservator, Kloe Rumsey shines a light on the conservation work she undertook to prepare a previously unseen banner for our 2020 Banner Exhibition.\nThis year we are very lucky to be able to include nine banners in the 2020 Banner Exhibition that have never been on display in the museum before. \u00a0Some of these are banners that have been loaned to us from current campaigns, some are recent acquisitions into the museum\u2019s collection, and some are banners that have been rolled in our store, waiting for the Conservation Team to have time to conduct the necessary work on them, to make them safe enough to hang.\n\nOne such patient banner is an A.P.E.X (Association of Professional, Executive, Clerical and Computer Staff) banner from the Grunwick strike (1976 \u2013 1978). \u00a0This banner has been waiting in the banner store for over 30 years and is finally on display for visitors in Main Gallery Two until Sunday 3 January 2021.\nMany of our banners that are described as in a \u2018non displayable condition\u2019 have not previously been treated because they have huge holes, pieces falling off them, or are in such otherwise fragile condition that it would take hundreds and hundreds of hours to conserve them; but don\u2019t worry, their time will come! \u00a0This Grunwick strike banner, however, had no large areas of damage, and the fabric it is made from is a remarkably sturdy cotton that has not begun to weaken.\nSo what was the problem then?\nThe problem with this banner was the presence of a plastic coated textile that makes up all of the text and the upper motif. \u00a030, or even 20, years ago, the conservation of plastic materials in museums was still in its early days of development. \u00a0By 2020, however, the discipline has been well studied and developed by conservators around the world, and, as part of the global conservation community, we can start to tackle the issues caused by plastics in the collection.\nWait, what problems? \u00a0I thought plastics last forever? \u00a0They do and they don\u2019t.\nPlastics last long enough to cause us the massive environmental problems that we are seeing around the world, but in museums, conservators have been witnessing the more subtle deterioration of plastic materials for decades. \u00a0This can be drastic changes in colour or flexibility, or the leaking of fluid plasticisers occurring as the chemical structure begins to harden with age. \u00a0Acidity is the main problem here; it worsens over time and when in contact with light, and starts to damage the materials around it, as well as catalysing its own decay. \u00a0It is for these reasons that this banner was rolled safely 30 years ago \u2013 to protect it, and to protect surrounding objects while in the store.\nConservation work was needed to make sure that the banner had not become too fragile to hang safely, and to assess the plastic to understand its needs and issues.\nStep one \u2013 we have to identify the type of plastic that has been used. \u00a0We have no access to testing equipment, but from examination (even smell can help us here) and knowledge of the manufacture of plastics we believe it is likely to be Polyvinyl chloride (PVC). \u00a0Alas this is one of the real problem plastics for museums.\u00a0 It is the most \u2018unstable\u2019. \u00a0\u00a0Fortunately the storage of the banner both in the dark and in the environmentally stable conditions of the store had slowed down the ageing process.\n\nStep two \u2013 the banner needed a thorough clean. \u00a0We avoid removing dirt gathered during the life and use of the banner, but there is always dust that is built up over years of storage or abandonment. \u00a0There were also significant creases that had been caused by stretching and distortion of the plastic lettering. \u00a0This caused a bit more of a problem as smoothing out the cotton fully would require changing the shape of the plastic. \u00a0We can\u2019t just iron the banners as it would cause damage, but there are methods of applying gentle heat enough to reshape in a controllable way. \u00a0This is where our identification of the plastic comes in handy. \u00a0Removing creases is safer for the textile element of the banner, but by researching PVC, we have learned of deterioration that begins at high temperatures and we had to leave creases in some areas to avoid exposing the letters to heat, however controllable our methods could be.\nThe more we know about plastics, the more we know that the best thing we can do for them is to carefully store and observe them. \u00a0We know that they will deteriorate, and that we must get the most out of objects in the collection while we still can; display them, and teach their history. \u00a0For example, Sellotape famously causes damage to paper and is often removed, but on this banner, it has been used as part of the lettering and therefore we must care for it and monitor the deterioration (yellowing, drying out), as we know that it will suffer over time.\n\nWith that bleak prospect in mind we are very pleased to be able to get this banner on display for visitors to the 2020 Banner Exhibition, and despite our concerns and the concerns of our predecessors 30 years ago, this banner is in remarkably stable condition and is likely to remain so for at least another decade.\nKloe Rumsey, Conservator, People\u2019s History Museum\nKloe specialises in object conservation and cares for the museum\u2019s whole collection, including banners, furniture, ceramics and posters.\n\n\n2020 Banner Exhibition, until Sunday 3 January 2021\nRevamping a quarter of PHM\u2019s main galleries, the majority of banners on display at the museum change annually.\u00a0 Visit 2020\u2019s selection of historic and contemporary banners including the Grunwick strike banner, all specially conserved by the museum\u2019s expert Conservation Team. \u00a0The exhibition has been carefully curated to include a number of banners which reflect on past and present migration movements, exploring the many challenges and opportunities migration presents.\nPart of PHM\u2019s year long programme exploring migration,

this year, here Director Katy Ashton looks back on a decade of success and looks forward to an ambitious future.\nWhat is special about 2020?\n2020 marks ten years of People\u2019s History Museum (PHM) being in its current building, and 30 years in Greater Manchester, which feels like a good excuse for a celebration!\u00a0 We will be celebrating our past, discussing our present and looking to our future.\nTen years ago PHM restored, expanded and re-opened its remarkable building that fuses the historic with the contemporary. \u00a0Since then our work has been transformative; quadrupling visitor numbers and establishing the organisation as a vital part of Greater Manchester\u2019s cultural and heritage offer.\nAs the Director of PHM for the past ten years, it has been a special journey of development and change for me, for the museum and for the world around us. \u00a0Reflecting on where we have been, where we are now and where we go next fills me with a powerful mixture of pride, excitement and hope!\nDescribe what you are most proud of?\nI am extremely proud of the work of the staff, volunteers and Trustees that are the core of PHM and who put their hearts and souls into everything they do, each and every day. \u00a0The \u2018PHM family\u2019 is a strong one made up of a passionate, skilled and committed group of people working with us today, and an equally enthusiastic and supportive group of advocates who have been involved in the past.\nI am proud of the power of our programme-led approach which has highlighted and commemorated key events and anniversaries, including Election! Britain Votes, The EURO Tunnel, Never Going Underground: The Fight for LGBT+ Rights, Represent! Voices 100 Years On and Disrupt? Peterloo and Protest.\u00a0 This has been radical and challenging, pro-democracy and pro-campaigning, shining a light on our amazing Designated collections of banners, badges, posters, cartoons, placards and more.\nI am also proud of the way we have worked with diverse communities and audiences to co-create our programmes over the last decade. \u00a0We have an incredibly participative approach and open our doors and collections to communities to carry out their own research, develop and write content, select artists and designers, and deliver public engagement. \u00a0This has created a multiplicity of voices in the museum and helped us to share community stories widely and crowdsource and collect contemporary material to strengthen our collections.\nAll of this is captured in our new Impact Report\u2013 which gives examples, statistics, quotes and images of the last decade of inspiring action, reaching out, making a difference and empowering tomorrow\u2019s voters. This report is full of examples of how we are changing people\u2019s lives through very personal experiences that take place in the museum, through to the collective impact that we have on the large numbers of people who are engaging physically and digitally with PHM every year.\nWhat can people see when visiting the museum?\nOur museum really is full of emotional, empowering, inspirational stories, people and collections from the past and the present. \u00a0The experience of visiting PHM is of connecting with people who have fought for ideas and values, who have dared to be different and who have made a positive change. \u00a0It is this which makes our museum special and which connects and resonates with everyone who visits and works with us.\nSo walking around the museum today, it is full of inspiration, excitement and the world changing ideas at the heart of our collections and stories \u2013 from election by ballot, votes for women, and workers\u2019 rights, to fair pay, equality for all and much more.\nWhat\u2019s happening at the museum in 2020?\nThis year there is huge excitement as we begin our most ambitious programme to date; exploring the theme of migration through the eyes of individuals whose own lives have all been shaped by their experiences of it. \u00a0We want the ethos of \u2018more in common\u2019 which runs through our 2020 programme to bring people together as we celebrate multicultural Britain, international solidarity and a global approach to our work.\nAs a museum about \u2018people\u2019 our ability to give communities and individuals a voice when they otherwise might not have one, is one of the most important things we do at PHM. \u00a0We use our collections, spaces and staff to open doors for people, connecting them with their own history and heritage, giving them space to tell their own stories and to share with others what they believe are still the ideas worth fighting for today. Working alongside community curators and community programme teams has been an incredibly exciting and empowering part of our programme-led approach as we\u2019ve gained new perspectives and looked at our collections and subject matter through the eyes of those with direct experience.\nWhat are your hopes for the future of the museum?\nI am really excited by the difference we can make to the world using our radical past to inspire people to take action in a time of ever increasing political, economic, social and environmental change and challenge.\u00a0 It is also exciting to see the new collections we are acquiring that document current and future campaigns for equality and social justice.\nAt a time when society feels divided and fractured it is important to have hope for the future. \u00a0At PHM we hope that the difference we make through our programme, our collections and our team is a positive one, and that we pass on that hope to others who care about the world we live in, want to get involved in their communities and want to engage in the democratic process. \u00a0I also hope that arts, culture and museums can play their part and demonstrate more widely that we can make a real difference in healing divides and bringing people together.\nAs the national museum of democracy our collections and work have never been as relevant or resonant as they are today. \u00a0We clearly have much to reflect upon and much to look forward to as our achievements provide a strong foundation for the next ten years and beyond. \u00a0I believe strongly that we have a real opportunity to provide a unique perspective that brings together the yesterday, today and tomorrow of democratic engagement. \u00a0We can bring people together and take a leading role in igniting and fuelling people\u2019s belief in their democratic responsibility and sense of citizenship \u2013 inspiring everyone to get engaged, take action and actively play their part.\n"}, {"link":

day we are highlighting a trade union banner from the 2020 Banner Exhibition. \u00a0It was the Transport & General Workers\u2019 Union (TGWU)\u00a0that helped lead the campaign to stop the exploitation of illegal immigrants, following the tragic drowning of Chinese cockle pickers working for gangmasters at Morecambe Bay in 2004.\nHere our friend Dr Claire Kennan, from the Department of History at Royal Holloway, University of London reveals the influence of unions stretching back to the Middle Ages.\n\nHow long have trade unions been around?\nHere at People\u2019s History Museum (PHM) is the oldest documented trade union banner in the world.\u00a0 It was created for the Liverpool Tin Plate Workers in 1821 by William Dickson for a procession to celebrate the coronation of King George IV. \u00a0Although this banner is nearly 200 years old, the history of trade unions actually goes back much further than you may think. \u00a0The concept of a trade union, or a body of workers joining together to protect their own interests, has a long history stretching back to the Middle Ages.\u00a0 These associations have always been problematic for successive governments and as early as 1549 it was made illegal for groups, \u2018confederacies or conspiracies\u2019 of workers to determine rates of pay or the amount of work to be done in a given time.[1]\nThe earliest examples of associations of working men and women, or guilds, come from the Anglo-Saxon period. \u00a0However, these guilds were generally concerned with collective worship and burial services, rather than regulating trade.[2] \u00a0Some craft focused guilds, however, did emerge during the 12th century in some English towns.[3] \u00a0By 1160 London had royally approved guilds of weavers and bakers, Oxford had guilds of weavers and shoemakers, while Winchester had guilds of weavers, and fullers.[4] \u00a0By the end of the 12th century a further seven towns had also founded officially recognised weavers\u2019 guilds.[5] \u00a0But it is not until the 14th century onwards that we see the craft guilds emerging on a larger scale, often developing out of local parish guilds in densely populated urban centres.\nWhat was the role of the first trade guilds?\nThese associations attempted to protect the employment of their members through controlling wages, working hours, the admission of apprentices and the standardisation of working practices, all while maintaining religious activities at their core.[6]\nOrdinances from the Tailors at York guild highlight the importance of maintaining certain standards within a trade. \u00a0Each year on the feast of St James the Apostle four \u2018good and loyal men\u2019 were chosen to \u2018search, oversee and examine the craft, and present any faults of its practitioners to the mayor of the said city\u2019.[7]\u00a0 The ordinance also details how masters of the craft could not poach apprentices and that when an apprentice had completed his training (usually a term of seven years) he was to be charged no more than 40d when setting up his first stall. \u00a0This equates to just over \u00a3100 today; it would take a skilled tradesman eight days to work to earn this much.\u00a0 It was also clearly set out that master craftsmen could face a fine of 2s (about \u00a360 today) if they did not pay their workers\u2019 wages on time.[8]\nDisputes over pay and conditions frequently arose and medieval craft guilds could often step in to settle these disagreements.\u00a0 In Worcester master craftsmen were attempting to pay their servants \u2018in kind\u2019 rather than in cash, and so the guild ordained that \u2018no labourer, or any other person of the said city, against his assent, will, or agreement, be compelled or charged to receive anything in chaffer [in kind] but in gold and silver\u2019.[9]\nWhat was the advantage of joining a trades guild?\nSkilled workers in urban trades realised the potential of powerful organisations as an effective tool for gaining concessions from employers and for ensuring that those taken on had the proper training.[10] \u00a0Young people were usually apprenticed in their early teens, so many of the documents regarding apprenticeship were concerned with moral behavior and pastoral care. An apprenticeship indenture made at Bridgewater, a market town in Somerset, between John Davy (tanner) and his wife Joan and Michael Laleye of Ireland in 1424 highlights some of these points. \u00a0Laleye agreed to serve his master and mistress faithfully throughout the term of his apprenticeship, keeping their \u2018secrets\u2019, doing them no dishonor or damage and not wasting any of their goods. \u00a0In return John Davy and his wife promised to teach and instruct Laleye, provide him with food, clothing and shelter and pay him at the end of his apprenticeship.[11]\nWhat did trade guilds offer their members?\nIn certain areas, workers grouped together in order to exclude \u2018interlopers\u2019 from their trades. \u00a0By the 1270s in Winchester, the dyers\u2019 guild was responsible for examining the quality of woad (a type of dye made from yellow-flowered plant and used to colour the wool) brought into the city by foreign merchants and by 1423 and the London blacksmiths had implemented controls over who entered their trade.[12] \u00a0In Southampton the tailors, coopers, shoemakers and blacksmiths all took collective actions (sometimes multiple times) to reduce the competition from workers coming from Spain, Portugal, Germany and Flanders.[13]\nWere there disputes between trade guilds and the authorities?\nSince the late Middle Ages, there have been attempts to resist these associations of workers, and even break their power.[14] \u00a0The 1179-1180 judicial enquiry and the 1388-1389 nationwide guild enquiry, ordered by Richard II\u2019s government, demonstrate the early concerns of those in government regarding associations of ordinary workers. \u00a0In 1179-1180, the main aim was to establish which associations had been formed with royal consent[15] and in 1388-1389 it was to discover exactly what these guilds were doing and how much wealth they had (in the aftermath of the 1381 Great Revolt the government was clearly wary of ordinary people meeting and coming together to improve their lot).\nSo while we may think of trade unions and their disputes with the government as a relatively modern phenomenon stemming from the Industrial Revolution, they were in fact in existence, in some form or other, from a much earlier date.\nDr Claire Kennan is Medieval Specialist and Education Lead for the Citizens 800 Project.\nUntil Sunday 3 January 2021\nRevamping a quarter of PHM\u2019s main galleries, the majority of banners on display at the museum change annually.\u00a0 Visit 2020\u2019s selection of historic and contemporary banners \u2013 some on public display for the first time, all specially conserved by the museum\u2019s expert\u00a0Conservation Team.\nPeople\u2019s History Museum is open seven days a week, from 10.00am to 5.00pm,\u00a0Radical Lates\u00a0are on the second Thursday each month, open until 8.00pm.\u00a0 The museum and its exhibitions are free to visit with a suggested donation of \u00a35.\u00a0 To find out about visiting the museum, its full exhibition and events programme visit\u00a0phm.org.uk.\n\n[1] Derek Keene, \u2018English urban Guilds 900-1300: The Purposes and Politics of association\u2019, in Guilds and Association in Europe, 900-1900, ed. by Ian A.

These impressive banners \u2013 many of which have been part of historic marches and rallies in the past \u2013 make up a quarter of the annually-changing gallery display; with the choice of banners for 2020 focusing on the theme of migration.\nMigration \u2013 the movement of people from one place to another \u2013 has informed the human history of the world, an ongoing process and point for discussion, across societies.\u00a0 Here in Manchester for example, patterns of migration have included everything from the arrival of Roman campaigns, to the travelling of people for work, trade and refuge.\nMigration affects and shapes us all, often in ways that we might not initially realise.\u00a0 The banners on display in the museum reflect this; although their links to migration might not be obvious at first, delving into the history behind them reveals fascinating connections. Banners are after all a piece of personal as well as political history \u2013 made by people, carried in marches, uniting groups under a cause they believe in and communicating key messages.\u00a0 From strike action throughout the centuries and personal campaigns, to protest marches including those against The Vietnam War, anti-immigration laws and the Poll Tax, banners have provided a point of unity, discussion and symbolism.\nThe exhibition includes a combination of those made by professional banner makers as well as homemade examples, all with stories behind them.\u00a0 These range from huge silk pieces adorned in artistry and beautiful sewing, to personally-sized banners \u2013 dating all the way from 1899 to examples made in 2019.\nAcross the 25 new banners on display for 2020, areas of discussion include; the legacy and issues of colonialism, communities supporting each other, the process of movement and the impact of legislation.\u00a0 The banners are interspersed over floors one and two of the museum gallery space, meaning that visitors can take them in amidst the museum\u2019s wider collection.\nKnown for their thought-provoking and profound displays, People\u2019s History Museum is also including nine banners that have never been on display before as part the 2020 Banner Exhibition \u2013 all maintained by the museum\u2019s specialist team of conservators.\u00a0 This means that the public can come and learn fascinating stories about migration and protest they may not have heard before.\n\nSo what are some of the banners on display? The oldest is the huge pure silk example from the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers in 1899 (seen here) \u2013 hand painted in oils and created in the London workshop of the notable banner maker George Tutill.\u00a0 The lavish materials of this banner link to a story of migration below the surface; as Tutill himself solidified his business in London so he could be close to the mainly migrant, highly-skilled silk weavers \u2013 many of Huguenot descent.\nSome of the most recently-made banners on display meanwhile, include those from Revive Women\u2019s Group (main image) \u2013 a local initiative supporting women refugees and those seeking asylum.\u00a0 As part of Refugee Week 2019, a number of women from the group worked with artist Ibukun Baldwin to create two striking banners; bold in their use of colour and the powerful messages conveyed.\u00a0 One banner declares \u2018Treat us with respect and dignity\u2019 whilst the other states \u2018No torture and injustice but human rights\u2019, highlighting the often harrowing experiences encountered by women in the migration process.\n\nRevealing hidden and under-discussed aspects of history is a key feature of these banners.\u00a0 Take the Transport & General Workers\u2019 Union (TGWU) banner for example \u2013 which although itself dates from the early 1980s, the union was first founded in 1922.\u00a0 It was the TGWU that helped lead the campaign to stop the exploitation of illegal immigrants, following the tragic drowning of Chinese cockle pickers working for gangmasters at Morecambe Bay in 2004; an incident that was recently discussed by Carey Davies in a \u2018Country Diary\u2019 entry in The Guardian. The TGWU proved a significant influence in its campaign\u00a0to regulate practices of gangmasters and address their exploitation of migration labour \u2013 with the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act passed in 2004 and Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority established by 2005.\nA poignant handmade banner, created by campaigners themselves, is the \u2018Mahoro Must Stay\u2019 banner (pictured), dating from 2007.\u00a0 The slogan references the case of Mahoro Mugabo, a woman who arrived in the UK in 2002 seeking asylum from Rwanda, following the murder of her husband by militia forces and then being imprisoned and raped by her captors. As she was HIV positive, Mohoro was unable to access life-saving drugs in Rwanda, so sought asylum in the UK \u2013 coming to settle in Didsbury.\u00a0 Yet it was twice whilst living in Didsbury that Mahoro was taken away from her home by the authorities to a deportation centre \u2013 highlighting the UK as one of the few European countries to have no legal limit on the duration of detention.\nThe 2020 Banner Exhibition therefore shows the issues and tensions that can arise around migration \u2013 but also considers opportunities for unity too.\u00a0 In 2010, Mahoro was told she had the right to remain in the UK and throughout the process, she was significantly supported by a range of local councillors, the MP John Leech, her church in Fallowfield and many friends.\u00a0 In total, it had taken 8 years for Mahoro to gain the reassurance of right to remain, and yet she had continued to show compassion and kindness; known for her work as a volunteer counsellor supporting fellow HIV sufferers.\nTherefore, although the stories behind a number of these banners are difficult, they also highlight a diversity of people coming together to support each other \u2013 including the UK showing solidarity at times of international crises.\u00a0 Take the example of the Printers Aid Spain banner, dating from the late 1930s and showing support for the workers of Spain at the time of the Spanish Civil War.\u00a0 After the bombing of the Basque town of Guernica (April 1937) 4000 children were evacuated to Britain \u2013 an example of migration not often discussed and the information at the side of the banner highlights some of their experiences, as well as the difficulties faced.\u00a0 Powerful and informative, the People\u2019s History Museum banner exhibition does not shy away from exposing the difficult truths and unhelpful prejudices about migration, allowing audiences to learn from the past and progress forwards.\nAnother banner \u2013 colourfully decorated and personally-sized, declaring Bread, Work and Freedom for the People of Chile was part of the demonstrations that took place in London to demand human rights for the people of Chile following the Chilean coup of 1973.\u00a0 A inspiring story of action that took place in response, was in the form of the UK based World University Service (WUS) that assisted over 900 Chileans fleeing General Pinochet\u2019s persecution, to come to the UK.\nThe 2020 Banner Exhibition is therefore filled with stories of migration both insightful as well as inspiring, with impact all over the world.\u00a0 To be able to take in such artefacts, right here in Manchester, is a profound experience \u2013 so why not pay a visit?\nCome along and browse two floors of galleries \u2013 with the banners interspersed throughout \u2013 as well as a unique viewing window into the specialist Conservation Studio; where each banner has been expertly cared for prior to hanging.\u00a0 See history in action, explore hidden heritage and be inspired.\nFind out more about the 2020 Banner Exhibition, open until to Sunday 3 January 2021 here.\n\nEmily Oldfield is a writer currently based in Manchester, with a particular passion for hidden histories and accounts of place.

event in People\u2019s History Museum\u2019s (PHM) calendar each year.\u00a0 The museum first took part in the annual OUTing the Past, The Festival of LGBT+ History in 2016 during which we hosted talks, drama performances and discussions concerning lived histories, LGBT+ footballers, and gender and sexuality in the armed forces.\u00a0 This was enormously successful and as such we were delighted to be asked to be involved with the festival again in the years that followed.\nThis year we are one of 22 OUTing the Past Hub venues in the UK, Ireland and USA.\n2020 will see us take part in the festival for a fifth consecutive year and we are delighted to be able to announce our line up of events for OUTing the Past Festival which will take place on Saturday 8 February 2020.\nThroughout the day there will be the opportunity to delve into our Archive & Study Centre\u2019s LGBT+ collections and talk to our Archive Team about how the collection continues to grow today, and how it is used by communities, researchers and individuals to explore the social and political stories of the past.\nThere will be a chance to join one of two guided tours of PHM\u2019s main galleries led by one of the Community Curators from our ground breaking 2017 exhibition Never Going Underground: The Fight for LGBT+ Rights. \u00a0The tour will be a chance to explore how the history of gender and sexuality has been affected by society, politics and activism over the past 200 years, using information that was crowdsourced in consultation with LGBT+ historians and community groups.\nIn the first of two presentations, Tash Lyons, volunteer at West Yorkshire Queer Stories (WYQS), will be exploring the important contributions West Yorkshire has made to LGBTIQ+ history through oral history highlights from the WYQS collection.\n\nFollowing on from this, Carl Austin-Behan, LGBT Advisor to the Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham will talk about his personal experience of being discharged from the RAF for being \u2018incomparable to service life\u2019, winning Mr Gay UK and becoming the youngest and first openly gay Lord Mayor of Manchester in 2016.\nIn the afternoon PHM\u2019s monthly Have Your Say event, facilitated by Workers\u2019 Educational Association (WEA) tutor Mark Krantz, is the opportunity for open conversation about the talking points of

Michael Powell and his team created the space and get an insight into which contemporary objects have been collected for display.\nProtest Lab is a space created within People\u2019s History Museum\u2019s (PHM) 2019 headline exhibition, Disrupt? Peterloo and Protest for visitors and local people to use to promote and take part in activism in commemoration of those who gathered at St Peter\u2019s Field in Manchester on 16 August 1819.\nIt is a place to leave information, a space to interact with and a space that is free to use for meetings or events to promote or plan campaigns.\nProtest Lab is part of PHM\u2019s 2019 programme exploring the past, present and future of protest, marking 200 years since the Peterloo Massacre; a major event in Manchester\u2019s history, and a defining moment for Britain\u2019s democracy.\nThe spirit of Peterloo is still very much alive today across Greater Manchester. \u00a0From campaigns fighting for votes for women, LGBT+ and disability rights, the people of Manchester and its surrounding towns and villages have taken a leading role in shaping and setting the national conversation on the fight for equality.\nAt this museum we strongly believe that to make history relevant, exciting and of purpose it has to sit in the world we live in today. \u00a0We chose Disrupt? Peterloo and Protest as our exhibition title as we wanted the exhibition to allow us to explore the variety of ways in which people actively participate in protest and campaigning today, in commemoration of the Peterloo Massacre.\nWe created the Protest Lab space within the exhibition to link Peterloo directly to activism today.\u00a0 The particular focus is upon non-violent creative disobedience, everyday and collective activism as themes to engage people who perhaps protest in different ways without realising they do, or consider that they don\u2019t at all, to be inspired by the actions of those who gathered at St Peter\u2019s Field to actively get involved in democracy and campaigning today. \u00a0Our intention was for people to see that social norms and values have often changed or been challenged by small groups of people working together to demand each change, and also to realise that even if you only don\u2019t eat specific things, or shop in particular places, these are all small but significant ways of protesting today.\nAs part of Protest Lab we promoted an open call for objects; asking people to add their own items that tell a story about protest to the exhibition. \u00a0These could range from traditional items such as placards and badges from a protest march, to everyday objects that tell a personal story of protest. \u00a0From March 2019 we ran a series of public drop off days, inviting people to come in with their objects and meet a member of the team.\u00a0 Our last drop off date, was fittingly on Thursday 12 December 2019, the date of the 2019 general election. \u00a0We also strove to be flexible; and to enable the exhibition to be as accessible as possible we often arranged to meet people at times and places to suit them.\nEach person who donated an object also wrote their own label and supplied, if possible, further images. \u00a0We felt it was really important that everyone wrote their own label, so they could share their own story, in their own words. \u00a0If people did not feel comfortable writing their own label, we recorded their spoken label, enabling people to tell their story in an alternative way.\nProtest Lab has evolved in exciting and unexpected ways throughout 2019 and it has been a real team effort from museum staff to maintain and add to it during the year. \u00a0The idea was that the space began as a blank canvas on the day the Disrupt? Peterloo and Protest exhibition opened, and became filled up with submissions from local people and communities over the year.\u00a0 It has been a tremendous success. \u00a0We have had 40 fantastic objects submitted via the open call, ranging from the local to the international. \u00a0From climate change inspired parking tickets, that primary school children from Denton used to put on their parents\u2019 cars to encourage them to switch off their engines at school pick up time, to an anonymous fabric patch left by someone involved in the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement protests that are still ongoing in Hong Kong. \u00a0We were overwhelmed with submissions of images and comment cards, so much in fact, that we had to create a special volunteer position to both manage and maintain these spaces. \u00a0We hosted six, month-long exhibitions within the space from groups who asked to use the space. \u00a0These included exhibitions from the Booth Centre, Manchester and Journeys Festival International Manchester. \u00a0We also hosted a great range of interesting events, workshops and discussions within the space throughout the year.\n\nA highlight of the events programme was our monthly Have Your Say event with members of Extinction Rebellion just four days after the Northern Rebellion happened on Deansgate (just round the corner from PHM) in the summer of 2019. \u00a0And before the exhibition closes on Sunday 23 February 2020, we have two more exhibitions to display from young people from Greater Manchester Youth Network\u2019s (GMYN) Changemakers programme and the campaign group, These Walls Must Fall.\u00a0 There will also be a series of fortnightly workshop sessions in the space with young people from Manchester Secondary Pupil Referral Unit (PRU), RECLAIM and 42nd Street, who have commissioned artist Andrew Westle to create a party as a form of a protest campaign event in February 2020.\nSo what next? \u00a0We are currently working through all the submissions we have received to the Protest Lab and are getting in touch with people who have donated objects to see if we might be able, where possible, to add some of these to the museum\u2019s permanent collection. \u00a0Protest Lab has been extremely useful in helping to further our contemporary collecting plans and policies.\u00a0 It has helped slim down and make accessible both our processes and the forms we use when we seek to collect objects from donors. \u00a0It has also created a wealth of crowdsourced data, which will help guide and drive future programming themes at PHM; based upon our audiences telling us what they care about and are interested in. \u00a0Protest Lab has also helped the museum to develop new relationships and strengthen pre-existing relationships with campaign groups and organisations across the UK, through offering free space for groups to meet.\nIt has been a fantastic project to work on, which could not have happened without a willingness to be flexible and take risks from everyone involved with it at PHM. \u00a0With special thanks in particular to our Visitor Services and Communications & Marketing teams, who have supported the programming and development of this concept to make it happen.\n\nDisrupt?

the police surrendered or fled and the Fenians established control of the road. \u00a0But then, unable to gain access to the van holding Kelly and Deasy with crowbars, they shot the lock off the van, accidentally killing the policeman sat with them inside, Sergeant Charles Brett.\nShocked by the audacity of the Fenians to act so openly in England itself, and using the death of Sergeant Brett as capital, an enraged British establishment cried out for Irish blood. Writing on the Fenian raid, the conservative press announced, \u2018one of the most audacious outrages that have occurred in this country for many years.\u2019[1] The Times newspaper made ominous calls for a \u2018stern and decisive repression,\u2019 preaching that, \u2018there is but one way of meeting unlawful terrorism. \u00a0It must be repelled by lawful terrorism.\u2019[2]\nWith the viscerally anti-Irish Tories in power at the time, these hardliners got the response they wanted. \u00a0Heavy handed and barely discriminate police raids of the Irish districts in Manchester produced 29 arrests. \u00a0After a quick and procedurally dubious trial process, five of these men were convicted of the murder of Sergeant Brett and condemned to death by hanging.\nAfter one of them (Michael O\u2019Brien) was pardoned because he quite obviously hadn\u2019t been at the ambush, and another (Edward Condon) had his sentence commuted after the intervention of the US government (he was an American citizen who had fought for the Union in the Civil War), three Irishmen were left to hang \u2013 publicly \u2013 at the New Bailey Prison in Salford, shortly after 8.00am on 23 November 1867.\nThe Manchester Martyrs were buried within the walls of the New Bailey Prison and also quickly given a shared tombstone in the hallowed grounds of Glasnevin (Ireland\u2019s national cemetery) by their Irish admirers; mock funeral processions (including one made up of 60,000 people in Dublin, and two in Manchester itself) followed as well as a song composed to mark their death (God Save Ireland \u2013 named for the closing words of Edward Condon\u2019s trial speech), which became the de facto Irish national anthem.\nThere is a memorial to Police Sergeant Charles Brett at the western end of St Ann\u2019s Church in central Manchester.\n\nFor the journalists and politicians who had demanded them, the executions of Allen, Larkin, and Maguire were a just punishment for a criminal act, but for millions of Irish people across the world they were glorified murder. \u00a0It renewed and deepened Irish fury against the British state. \u00a0So long as Fenianism, with its separatist republican project, was the only movement offering a transformed future to Irish people under famine at home and proletarianisation across the industrial diaspora, then every attempt to repress it would be futile.\nThe tale of the Manchester Martyrs is well worth the reflection of anyone interested in the histories of Manchester and Ireland, and of anyone committed to a politics of reconciliation, understanding, and progress for the British Isles today.\u2019\nPeter Morgan PhD historian at UCL and head writer at the Radical Tea Towel Company.\nOur friends at Salford\u2019s Working Class Movement Library (WCML) hold material on the Manchester Martyrs, including early pamphlets, late 20th century material about the commemorations, a letter written by William Allen to his mother dated 27 October 1867 from New Bailey Prison and a copy of the letter from Michael O\u2019Brien to his brother dated 14 November 1867. You can also read more about the Manchester Martyrs sculpture that was never made in this blog The Manchester Martyrs maquette.\nOnce a sprawling jail housing nearly 1,000 inmates, New Bailey Prison closed in 1868. \u00a0Where it stood has now been built upon and replaced with a brand new riverside development.\nAnother piece of history from this location from exactly 200 year ago will be celebrated later this month \u2013 when the Bones of Thomas Paine, a larger than life skeleton puppet sitting in a chest, will travel from Salford to Manchester to recreate a quirky chapter of history when his bones were turned away by the city of Manchester and subsequently lost. \u00a0The Bones of Paine procession will leave Working Class Movement Library at 4.00pm on Saturday 30 November, stopping at New Bailey at 5.00pm, arriving at People\u2019s History Museum at 5.15pm, which will be staying open until 6.00pm specially to welcome the marchers and give them the chance to see Thomas Paine treasures on display in the museum galleries.\n\n[1] The Annual Register: A Review of Public Events at Home and Abroad for the Year 1867, (London, 1868), part 2, \u201cChronicle of Remarkable

00:00:00", "text": "This week marks the 30th anniversary of the destruction of the Berlin Wall.\u00a0 And three decades after the its fall, we are displaying pieces of the wall that we have in our collection.\u00a0 People\u2019s History Museum\u2019s Collections Officer, Sam Jenkins tells us about the history of the barbed wire topped wall that took away basic human rights.\nA physical barrier, made up of concrete blocks and perimeter fences, that surrounded the city of West Berlin from 1961 until 1990.\u00a0 At\u00a012 feet tall and four feet wide, the wall and its surrounding security systems were known as the death strip; filled with tripwire machine guns, trenches and dogs, and guarded by soldiers in watchtowers.\nAfter World War II, Germany had been split between the Federal Republic of Germany (FDG) in the west, and the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the east.\u00a0 The GDR was allied with the Soviet Bloc, and was a satellite state of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), while the FDG was an independent state allied with the Western Bloc and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).\u00a0 Berlin had also been split between these powers, despite being in the eastern zone.\u00a0 West Berlin became a pocket of western ideology in the Soviet east.\nThe west of Berlin, under capitalism, had become a vibrant and wealthy city, and attracted a lot of young well educated people from East Germany. \u00a0The GDR built the wall to try and stop this \u2018brain drain\u2019.\nThe wall was originally made of wire fence and concrete blocks but was strengthened several times while it stood, with the fourth and final version being completed in 1975.\nA year after it was first built a second fence was built parallel to the wall on the east side; all buildings and vegetation between the two was destroyed, creating the death strip.\u00a0 This strip of land offered no cover and clear fields of sight for the wall guards, who were ordered to shoot on sight anyone attempting to cross the wall illegally. \u00a0To the west, however, the wall backed straight onto the streets.\nIt was very difficult and dangerous to cross from East to West Berlin after the wall was built, but many people still tried; between the building and the fall of the wall, around 5,000 people managed to defect. \u00a0Many used tunnels to avoid detection, but others tried to scale the wall or drive vehicles through checkpoints.\nThe wall guards were given permission to shoot at defectors attempting the crossing, and over 100 people died trying to get to the west.\nPeople in the west protested against the wall when it was first erected, and acts of protest continued until it was dismantled. \u00a0From 1975 West Berliners famously painted street art and graffiti onto the west side of the wall, in a continuing creative act of protest.\nMusician David Bowie and actor David Hasselhoff played concerts for people on both sides of the wall, which can be seen as a protest against the division the wall created, and musician Bruce Springsteen, playing a concert in East Berlin in 1988, spoke directly of being against the wall\u2019s existence.\nEast Berliners also protested against the wall, especially in the months leading up to it falling, and the restrictions placed on their movement. \u00a0In 1989 the Peaceful Revolution began with weekly demonstrations in towns and cities throughout East Germany calling for democracy.\nThere are a lot of factors that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. \u00a0The weakening of the Soviet States in the late 1980s started to change the outlook of the country. \u00a0The reopening of borders between Eastern and Western Bloc countries, including between Hungary and Austria, allowed more routes for defectors, and the GDR\u2019s efforts to stop this led to large scale demonstrations across East Germany.\nThe GDR\u2019s borders with Hungary and Czechoslovakia, which had been closed after an influx of East German refugees, were reopened in November 1989. \u00a0However, the large number of refugees put a huge strain on relations between the two countries and the GDR. \u00a0The East German government soon decided that emigration would be allowed through all border crossings, including across the Berlin Wall. \u00a0The change was announced in a press conference on 9 November 1989, though the intended start date of 10 November had not been communicated to the official spokesperson giving the conference.\nThousands of people soon arrived at the wall demanding to be let through. \u00a0The guards, who had not been warned about the changes, were overwhelmed and, eventually, opened the gates to all without checking identities. \u00a0Thousands of East Berliners went through and were greeted by West Berliners with flowers and champagne. \u00a0The wall had fallen.\nAfter the wall fell, people started chipping parts off to keep as souvenirs. \u00a0So many pieces were taken by the \u2018wall woodpeckers\u2019 that large holes were opened in the wall itself.\nThe German government began officially dismantling the wall in June 1990, with larger sections being taken out and donated to museums around the world. \u00a0Sections of the wall were also left standing in Berlin, as a mark of the division the city saw. \u00a0On one of these remaining sections of the wall, more than 100 large scale painted murals can be seen.\n\nThe pieces of wall that we have in our collection came from the \u2018wall woodpeckers\u2019 and were taken as souvenirs. \u00a0These came into our care in 1989 and 1990, but there are still pieces of Berlin Wall sold in tourist shops throughout Berlin today.\u2019\nPeople\u2019s History Museum is open seven days a week from 10.00am to 5.00pm, and is free to enter with a suggested donation of \u00a35.\u00a0\u00a0Radical Lates\u00a0are the second Thursday each month, 10.00am until 8.00pm.\nSee the pieces of the wall on display in the museum until the end of this year.\nThe museum\u2019s internationally significant collection includes items of national importance from the last 250 years of British social and political history.\u00a0 The museum\u2019s archive is home to over 95,000 photographs and includes images of the Berlin Wall from the Communist Party of Great Britain.\n"}, {"link":

Fellow in Public History, Dr Matthew Smith gives an introduction to Archives Alive: Peterloo, a film project bringing together some of the best Peterloo archives, from just a click away.\n\u2018This year we\u2019ve seen a wide range of activities and projects taking place to commemorate the bicentenary of the Peterloo Massacre but one you may have missed is Archives Alive: Peterloo.\u00a0 The project is led by Royal Holloway, University of London, and The National Archives, supported by the Parliamentary Archives and funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.\nAs part of this project a series of 18 short films, bringing to life testimony, letters and newspaper reports relating to the massacre, have been produced. \u00a0These include accounts of the period leading up to the meeting at St Peter\u2019s Field, accounts of the massacre itself and sources which shed light onto the reaction to the massacre and its aftermath. \u00a0The films are all available via the Royal Holloway History Hub YouTube channel and will shortly have a dedicated page on The National Archives website.\nAmong the films you will find an address from the Manchester Female Reform Society, reported in the pro-reform Manchester Observer newspaper on 31 July 1819. \u00a0The society had been formed that same month, just one month prior to the Peterloo Massacre. \u00a0Mary Fildes, its President, was on the same platform as the main speaker, Henry Hunt.\n\nHunt\u2019s invitation to the people of Manchester to attend the meeting, \u2018with no other weapon but a self-approving conscience\u2019, has also been re-created by the Royal Holloway team.\n\nLooking to the massacre itself, it is interesting to hear the Manchester Observer\u2019s account of the \u2018cowardly and bloody attack\u2019 on those assembled at St Peter\u2019s Field.\u00a0 Of particular note in the account is the blame accorded to the 30 citizens of the city who swore under oath that the town was in danger \u2013 therefore providing the magistrates with some legal cover for their order to disperse the crowd.\n\nThe project also sheds light on to lesser known accounts, such as the pro-magistrate evidence gathered by the Home Secretary, Lord Sidmouth, after the massacre. \u00a0This includes testimony from constable Jonathan Anderson, which ends with the incredible line that he had not seen anyone struck by a sabre.\n\nThe anger caused by the official whitewashing of the events at St Peter\u2019s Field and the lack of justice for those killed or injured is summed up well in the following open letter from Richard Carlile, one of those invited to speak on 16 August, to the Home Secretary.\n\nWhile the Peterloo Massacre was swiftly followed by a series of repressive pieces of legislation, known as the Six Acts, the cause of reform was far from cowed into silence, as this letter published in the Manchester Observer demonstrates.\n\n15 of the documents featured in these videos come from the collections of The National Archives, two from the Parliamentary Archives and one from the archives of The Times newspaper.\u00a0 The idea behind the project was to make these collections more accessible and engaging for wider audiences through dramatisation.\u00a0 In particular, it is hoped the videos will be used to help school students better understand both the events of 16 August 1819 and the context in which they took place.\nIn the same spirit, the videos also feature in the free online course \u2018Peterloo to the Pankhursts: Radicalism and Reform in the 19th Century\u2019 developed by Royal Holloway and People\u2019s History Museum, which is running for a second time from Monday 4 November 2019 onward. This popular course similarly attempts to contextualise the Peterloo Massacre by framing it in the wider struggle for rights and representation from the aftershocks of the American and French Revolutions through to the outbreak of World War I and the campaign for votes for women.\nThis course was produced by the same team who are behind the Archives Alive project \u2013 the Citizens project team. \u00a0The Citizens project is producing a wide range of free educational videos exploring the history of liberty, protest, rebellion and reform from Magna Carta to the suffragettes and beyond. \u00a0If you would like to see more of their work you can follow them on Twitter @Citizens800 and visit and subscribe to the History Hub YouTube channel, which also features a series of videos produced with People\u2019s History Museum.\u2019\nPeople\u2019s History Museum (PHM) is open every day from 10.00am to 5.00pm, and is free to enter with a suggested donation of \u00a35.\u00a0 Radical Lates are the second Thursday each month, 10.00am to 8.00pm.\nDisrupt?

planet B", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-10-25 00:00:00", "text": "\n\u2018My name is Lillia, I\u2019m 10 years old and a youth activist.\u00a0 I\u2019m passionate about the planet and making sure it is a safe place for animals and all people who live on it.\u00a0 There is no planet B and we won\u2019t get another chance to make things right.\nWe have a proud history of protest in Manchester; \u2018deeds not words\u2019 were written proudly across the suffragette\u00a0banners when they called others to action, because they knew promises and words meant nothing if not backed up by action and deeds, and the changing of the laws to make sure those actions were done.\nGreater Manchester has a history that has seen many stand up against injustice, and doing what is right.\u00a0 I learnt about the Pankhurst sisters in Manchester and Annie Kenny in Oldham and their roles in the suffrage movement.\u00a0 I\u2019ve learnt about Peterloo and how the first trade union was founded here in Manchester in 1818 as well as the Rochdale Mill workers who wouldn\u2019t use slave picked cotton during the cotton famine. \u00a0And through all this I was inspired by their non-violent civil disobedience and their use of placards and banners to get their message across, as well as the marches, and sit-ins and strikes. \u00a0And I really hope that in generations to come people will look back and be learning about the environmental movement and I\u2019ll be proud to be part of that history \u2013 standing up for climate justice!\nWe need climate justice! \u00a0Especially as I, and most people, worry about the future of ourselves and the planet but there are people who are already suffering and yes, dying because of the effects of climate change.\nIn 11 years I will be 21.\nScientists gave us 12 years to limit climate change before there is nothing we can really do. \u00a0Since I started striking and protesting for climate justice I had a birthday, and we have gone past the 11 year mark and are now almost at 10 years until we reach a tipping point that we can\u2019t turn back from.\nI have hopes and dreams for 21 year old me that may only be just that, but at least I am still able to think of my future, for some children in the world it is already too late, and for the children like me, if nothing\u2019s done, by the time we are 21 the climate as we know it will be hotter across the world which will cause more flooding, more droughts, forest fires, sea levels rising, crop failures, climate migration and animal extinctions, and it\u2019s going to be bad.\u00a0 It really is scary to think about, but activism gives me hope and a way to feel less hopeless.\u00a0 Being able to express myself and have my voice heard means everything to me.\u00a0 Especially being part of the environmental community in Manchester, who have been so supportive of me, especially amplifying my voice and supporting me.\u00a0 They make me feel less alone, I am not the only person who thinks and feels like I do.\nEach Friday you will find me in St Peter\u2019s Square in Manchester city centre, 12.00pm to 2.00pm striking with Friday\u2019s For Future Manchester group. \u00a0I\u2019ve also helped to campaign for Manchester City Council (MCC) to declare a climate emergency, as well as taken part in actions with Rising Up Families Manchester, campaigning for the Greater Manchester Pensions Fund, to stop investing in fossil fuels, and raising awareness of animal extinction in the UK with the Carnival of Creatures march through Manchester in June 2019.\nI joined the Friday\u2019s For Future Manchester group in February 2019, and took part in the first youth climate strike a few weeks later and I have been to every youth strike since.\u00a0 We achieved our aim, working alongside other groups, of getting the UK to declare a climate emergency on 1 May 2019.\u00a0 I even attended a strike on my birthday in the pouring rain because that is how important the issues of the environment are for me.\nBoth Manchester and the UK declared climate emergencies and I was so excited each time. \u00a0But then nothing! \u00a0Both the UK and Manchester has done nothing to treat what is happening to our planet as an emergency.\u00a0 And I finally learnt a valuable lesson about what the suffragettes meant about \u2018deeds not words!\u2019 \u00a0It is really easy for someone to say and promise something but unless they act it means nothing.\u00a0 That is why I have also joined Extinction Rebellion actions because, like me they want the government to tell the truth about the reality of the climate crisis but also to then act on it and have citizens\u2019 assemblies. \u00a0This means that people will have a say on how we tackle the climate crisis too, and for me that is really important because as a young person I have a voice, and opinions and I feel it is really important that people of all ages have a say in our future, especially young people now as it will be our futures that will be impacted the most.\nThis is already happening to millions of people across the world, with storms in the Bahamas.\u00a0 Big parts of Bangladesh under threat because of sea levels rising.\u00a0 Congo and Amazon forest fires.\u00a0 Oil pollution in Nigeria that is polluting the rivers and fish people have to eat \u2013 it\u2019s poisoning them.\u00a0 But also because of big businesses, especially fossil fuel companies, that are a major source of carbon emissions.\u00a0 There are already people suffering around the world and that is before you even look at plastic pollution and animal extinction \u2013 we need to act urgently.\nWhen I thought of this it was so overwhelming.\u00a0 Then I got talking to other youth activists across the city, country and world on social media, who were doing so much in their local areas and I learnt that if we all act on the environment in our local areas and within our own countries it can make a huge impact globally.\nI found out that in 2018 there were over 2,000 air pollution related deaths in Greater Manchester, and I was shocked to think that could happen in my own city and the council was doing nothing to prevent this from happening so I took part in Extinction Rebellion\u2019s northern rebellion (30 August \u2013 4 September 2019).\nA part of Deansgate (a main road running through Manchester city centre) was shut down for four days. \u00a0I attended each day because it was important to take part in an action that helped to get truthful information to the public about air pollution in our cities. \u00a0MCC don\u2019t include airport emissions in the carbon figures and targets, and they plan to build a car park on Ancoats retail park and on green belt land \u2013 destroying habitats \u2013 after declaring a climate emergency.\u00a0 Scientists from Extinction Rebellion measured air pollution during the action to show that the illegal levels of pollution on Deansgate dropped, making the street a safer place for all. \u00a0And yet this action hasn\u2019t made MCC do anything about the emergency.\u00a0 And this week I learnt they are still going ahead with building a car park next to a school. \u00a0But that doesn\u2019t mean we give up because the northern rebellion made\u00a0the public aware of what is happening, as they were able to get information out about the truth of the crisis we are facing and how it affects everyone. \u00a0It helped the public know the truth that the council and the government put profit before people\u2019s health \u2013 and that\u2019s wrong!\nThat is why I protest because not only are Greater Manchester councils not taking the climate emergency seriously, but our government isn\u2019t either. \u00a0We are in the beginning of the sixth mass extinction. \u00a0We are being catapulted towards it because of human action. \u00a0We are being told to recycle, eat less meat, reduce and yes we have to take responsibility for our actions but the kind of change needed won\u2019t happen unless governments and big businesses make changes too \u2013 and fast.\u00a0 Unless they introduce laws that hold businesses accountable to make the planet a safer place. \u00a0Unless they divest from fossil fuels (MCC\u2019s promise of divestment by 2050 is too late) and move to sustainable ways to power, make, and grow things.\u00a0 The\u00a0politicians that run our country and countries across the world\u00a0need to\u00a0listen to\u00a0the\u00a0voices\u00a0of activists and scientists and especially indigenous people who observe the land and know it better than anyone about what needs to be done to\u00a0help slow down what is happening.\n\nI\u2019ve learnt so much since I began striking.\u00a0 I am lucky that my Mum works around my education and her work so I can take part in strikes and protests.\u00a0 School is not the only place education happens, it\u2019s not been from\u00a0a text book, but in the real world and it has really helped me understand that everything we do is connected and\u00a0that not everything we are taught is right and that it\u2019s ok to have my own opinions, and to question.\u00a0 I\u2019ve learnt about geography, animal extinction, the history of climate change, migration, racism, feminism, democracy and a little on the law \u2013 and how it fits together and overlaps.\nBut I have also learnt how to express myself, so when I do feel overwhelmed I can put what I feel into speeches, poems, banners and songs and it has given me so much confidence.\u00a0 Especially to know that what I have to say is important and I have to right to be heard about issues that affect me.\nBut the most important thing I have learnt through protest is that no matter how

We were all young footballers trying to get on and make a living. \u00a0What I would like to say though is that the likes of Cyrille Regis and Laurie Cunningham, who are sadly no longer with us, should really be mentioned at this stage.\nI saw Cyrille a couple of months before he died earlier this year and he looked so fit and healthy. \u00a0The last thing you would\u2019ve thought is that he would die a few weeks later, so you\u2019ve got to seize every moment and opportunity to the full because you never know what\u2019s around the corner and Cyrille was a great example of that.\nAlthough we didn\u2019t grow up together we were of similar ages and we came through at a similar sort of time with our clubs.\nFor me and Laurie, it was a question of who would be the first black player to play for England. \u00a0Laurie ended up being the first when he played for the under 21s and I was then lucky enough to become the first senior international and it\u2019s something I\u2019m obviously still very proud of. \u00a0To be the first at anything, you\u2019ve got to be proud.\nI remember my former Manchester United team mate Norman Whiteside, who is still the youngest player to have played in a World Cup Final, telling me that one day his record will be beaten but mine will never be beaten.\u00a0 It\u2019s an analogy I still tell people today, so I\u2019m proud and privileged to have been the first black England international.\nMy parents came to England from Jamaica and I was born in and raised in Nottingham.\nGrowing up, I remember it was always sportspeople who I looked up to. \u00a0I remember Clyde Best, seeing him on the television and he was the first black person I ever saw on TV, so I just thought at the time that he must be a good player.\nI then went to Manchester United at an early age and from 15 or 16, every school holiday I went up there as a school boy and I saw George Best, Denis Law and Bobby Charlton training and they were also great inspirations to me.\nI could say it was Nelson Mandela, but really, it was always people in sport that I recognised. Nelson Mandela was a politician and an activist, so I wasn\u2019t really into that mind set growing up.\u00a0 It was people in my sport who stood out to me, like Clyde Best and Best, Law and Charlton.\nA lot has been said over the years about the climate in football for black players at that time, when me, Cyrille, Laurie and Brendan Batson were coming through and it was very tough.\nBut we were fortunate in a way because we had strong managers. \u00a0I had Brian Clough at Forest and they had Ron Atkinson at West Brom and I think they helped and guided us through the murky waters.\nI recall Cloughie saying to me early on: \u2018If you\u2019re going to let people like that dictate to you, you\u2019re no good to me and you\u2019re no good to yourself.\u2019\nAnd I desperately wanted to be a footballer, so I just dismissed anything that was thrown at me, literally, and tried to get on with playing football, which I loved.\nIt was as simple as that and I think you had to be as single-minded as that because if you let the periphery stuff affect you, you wouldn\u2019t have a career and I was very focused on being a footballer and I enjoyed a great career.\nFor me, it felt like a natural progression to become a coach when my playing days were coming to an end at Sheffield Wednesday.\nI was persuaded to go and be the player manager at Barnsley by the chairman, who was John Dennis at the time. \u00a0That was over 20 odd years ago now. \u00a0I took Danny Wilson with me as assistant because I knew how tough being a player manager would be.\nAt the time there was Keith Alexander, who was also born and bred in Nottingham, who got the job at Lincoln City just before I went to Barnsley to become one of the first black managers.\nThe talk back then, when Keith got his job and I got the job at Barnsley, was that there was going to be a new revolution with more black managers, more Asian managers and everything else that goes with it.\nBut that never materialised, so clearly, we\u2019ve got a problem in our society where people think that black players are good footballers but they don\u2019t make good managers.\nSo I think something has to give. \u00a0There\u2019s the Rooney Rule which has been talked about, and since it\u2019s over 20 years since I was a manager and nothing has really changed, let\u2019s try it.\nWe should try anything to help bridge that gap, because in my view there\u2019s too many great footballers who have been wasted because they\u2019re not involved in football.\u00a0 People like Paul Ince, Sol Campbell, Andy Cole, Rio Ferdinand and the list goes on and on.\u00a0 Surely, with the level they have played at, they can give something back to the next generation of footballers.\u2019\nPeople\u2019s History Museum (PHM) is proud to honour the Radicals who believe in ideas worth fighting for.\u00a0 Like Viv Anderson MBE, there are many stories of Radical thinkers told throughout the museum and still lots more to be explored.\nFind out how you can\u00a0support PHM.\u00a0 From just \u00a330 per year, you can\u00a0Join the Radicals\u00a0or like The FA, become a Radical Sponsor and help the museum continue to celebrate and commemorate those people who campaign for ideas worth fighting for. \u00a0Your support can help us engage more people in democracy, exploring its development in the past, present and future of Britain.\n"}, {"link": "https://phm.org.uk/blogposts/preparing-banners-for-display/", "category": "", "title": "Conserving the Cardinal: preparing banners for display", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-09-17 00:00:00", "text": "At our museum we are incredibly lucky to house the world\u2019s largest collection of trade union and political banners.\u00a0 In this month\u2019s blog, our Conservator, Jenny van Enckevort explains the painstaking work it took to prepare one of our largest for our 2019 Banner Display.\nThe majority of banners on display at People\u2019s History Museum\u2019s (PHM) change annually, enabling the team to rotate the banners on open display and curate the display in line with the museum\u2019s programme theme for each year. \u00a0Many of banners are displayed free hung so visitors can experience them as they were originally used. This approach means we are able to display both sides of our large banners but often leads to a more interventive form of treatment.\u00a0 And 20 years after entering PHM\u2019s collection one of the largest banners in the collection was requested for display.\u00a0 This offered me the opportunity to re-visit the treatment and make it stable enough to display for a limited time.\nA highlight of the 2019 Banner Display at PHM is the Amalgamated Society of Watermen & Lightermen Greenwich Branch No13 Cardinal Manning Lodge banner and at 358 cm x 332 cm it is one of our largest banners.\u00a0 Alongside many of the banners in the collection this banner is featured in John Gorman\u2019s 1973 publication Banner Bright: An Illustrated History of Trade Union Banners.\u00a0 In it Gorman refers to the re-discovery of this banner,\nAmalgamated Society of Watermen & Lightermen Greenwich Branch No13 Cardinal Manning Lodge banner \u00a9 Banner Bright: An Illustrated History of Trade Union Banners, around 1970\n\u2018The first box contained a banner wrapped in mildewed canvas sheets. I unrolled the banner onto the floor of the studio but it was difficult to discern the nature of the design since it was covered by a patina. I began to clean the banner with a solution of turps and linseed oil.\u00a0 It was like the restoration of an old oil painting as colours and form began to emerge. The picture was of a cardinal in scarlet robes and skull cap, the last subject I had expected to find on a trade union banner.\u2019\nWe think the banner was made in the 1890s to pay tribute to Cardinal Manning who mediated in the Great Dock Strike of 1889. This was a turning point in the labour movement which resulted in the growth of unions representing less skilled, lower paid workers. \u00a0Manning was respected on both sides and particularly revered by the Irish Catholic workers.\u00a0 Despite this he was a divisive figure having begun his clerical career in the Church of England before converting to Catholicism. \u00a0In church matters he was conservative but his views on labour and the working conditions for the poor, as well as animal rights, were quite in line with modern left wing politics.\nAmalgamated Society of Watermen & Lightermen Greenwich Branch No13 Cardinal Manning Lodge banner (detail).\nThe banner features a portrait of Manning, in his cardinal robes, on one side and a scene of the River Thames at Greenwich on the opposite side. \u00a0The lightermen used barges to transfer goods from larger ships to the docks, and traditionally powered only by log oars called sweeps. \u00a0The watermen carried passengers from ship to shore.\nLike many of the banners in the collection this banner is made from a single layer of silk, in this case blue, with an oil painting on both sides.\u00a0 It is also trimmed with red silk borders; these are not original. \u00a0Although the banner is not signed we think it was made by a company called Kenning & Son. Their distinctive style featuring decorative scrolling vines in metallic paints above and around the central painted panel is evident.\nAmalgamated Society of Watermen & Lightermen Greenwich Branch No 13 Cardinal Manning Lodge banner (reverse) \u00a9 People\u2019s History Museum\nWhen conserving a banner various proposals are considered to find a compromise between historic conservation and modern intervention.\u00a0 We know that this banner was conserved at least twice before it came to our museum; each time returning to the Transport and General Workers Union. \u00a0It is thought that successive interventions, unfavourable display and storage conditions during this time contributed to the deterioration of the original materials. \u00a0When the banner was assessed at PHM it was noticed that areas of the adhesive film had failed and the heavy oil painted central panel was no longer adequately supported.\nThe conservation was challenging because it had to take into account the previous treatments and the interventions which now form part of the history of the banner and have impacted on its current condition.\u00a0 The banner has suffered vertical and horizontal splits through the main painted panel, probably from being folded at some point in time. \u00a0The silk background fabric is faded, fragile and powdery, damage associated with prolonged light exposure.\u00a0 The reverse side of the painted panel was also covered in dark blue silk which somewhat obscured the detail of the image.\nAmalgamated Society of Watermen & Lightermen Greenwich Branch No13 Cardinal Manning Lodge banner (detail of condition featuring tears in the painted surface)\nThe old adhesive support covering the reverse side of the painted panel was cut away and the banner was cleaned on both sides with a tiny vacuum which enables us to pick up fine dust and debris from the surface of the textile.\nJenny van Enckevort, PHM Conservator cleaning the Amalgamated Society of Watermen & Lightermen Greenwich Branch No13 Cardinal Manning Lodge banner\nA new sheer silk support was dyed in a more complementary colour, this was then cast with a stronger adhesive to take the weight of the panel and adequately support the large tears. Once dry the silk was trimmed into three strips, intended to run vertically down the banner, with a small overlap on each side. \u00a0I used a small heated spatula to re-activate the adhesive once it is in position, this is a more controlled way of working than using wet adhesive in direct contact with the object. \u00a0It is worth noting that the blue silk, covering the original silk background fabric, was retained as it was thought that removal of this would further compromise the strength of the banner.\nWhen working with such a large banner as conservators, we have to roll them onto a cardboard tube as we work to enable us to reach the centre, this is also how we handle the banners to move them around for photography and display.\nJenny van Enckevort, PHM Conservator applying conservation support to the Amalgamated Society of Watermen & Lightermen Greenwich Branch No13 Cardinal Manning Lodge banner\nThe final conservation solution delivered the required level of support while retaining elements of previous treatment.\u00a0 And once complete, a cotton sleeve was sewn to the top edge to provide even support for hanging and it was then ready for display.\u00a0 You can see it in the space as one of the big three next to The Conservation Studio in Main Gallery Two until January 2020.\u2019\nAmalgamated Society of Watermen & Lightermen Greenwich Branch No13 Cardinal

Manchester Pride, Bernard Donoghue, Trustee at People\u2019s History Museum (PHM) and CEO of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (ALVA) reflects on why he chose to be the PHM Radical Sponsor of Alan Turing.\n\u2018Alan Turing (1912-1954) was an outstanding mathematician and codebreaker whose work has had an enormous impact on how we live today. \u00a0During his life, he worked just a stone\u2019s throw away from PHM at The University of Manchester. \u00a0As the father of computer science and artificial intelligence, as well as a war hero, Alan Turing\u2019s contributions were far ranging and path breaking. \u00a0\u2018Turing is a giant on whose shoulders so many now stand\u2019. \u00a0Words used by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, when announcing that Alan Turing will be the face of the new \u00a350 note at Manchester\u2019s Science and Industry Museum last month.\nSuch public recognition, or tribute, would have thought to be undesirable, if not impossible, just few years ago. \u00a0His genius was harnessed by the state but his character was assassinated by it. \u00a0His extraordinary achievements in codebreaking at Bletchley Park in World War II, his role as the father of modern computing and artificial intelligence, are remarkable and truly revolutionary.\nIn his novel about homosexual love in early 20th century England Maurice, published posthumously, the writer E M Forster, himself gay, wrote, \u2018England has always been disinclined to accept human nature.\u2019 \u00a0The legally sanctioned persecution of gay men, and the general climate of homophobia and intolerance that was prevalent when Turing was alive was ultimately responsible for his death.\u00a0 In 1952 he was convicted for gross indecency, following which he was chemically castrated. \u00a0He committed suicide in 1954.\nThe announcement that Alan Turing will now be on a bank note 65 years after his death is in no small way a tribute to the successful campaign to have his genius and achievements recognised, and for the state to atone for his death. \u00a0In 2013 he was given a posthumous Royal pardon for his conviction after leading figures including Professor Stephen Hawking lobbied the Prime Minster.\nAlan Turing is one of the People\u2019s History Museum\u2019s Radicals, men and women who have lived extraordinary lives, and in their very radicalism, changed the economic, political, cultural and scientific landscape of this nation and beyond. \u00a0I am proud and honoured to be his Radical Sponsor, a donor to this radical and extraordinary museum which tells the stories of people power and ideas worth fighting for. \u00a0I sponsor Alan Turing not only because of who he was and what he achieved \u2013 we all \u2018stand on the shoulders of giants\u2019 like him \u2013 but also of what and who he represents. \u00a0The disregarded, the expendable, the intolerable, the unacceptable.\nIn the heart of Manchester\u2019s Gay Village in Sackville Park is a statue of Alan Turing. \u00a0We have come a long way in recognising and celebrating the diversity of human nature, but it is not a completed journey. \u00a0Rights are always fought for, never willingly given. \u00a0We are reminded every day of the need to be alert to the erosion of liberty and to continually fight for our beliefs and of our right to be who we are and to love whom we choose.\nIn an interview given to The Times newspaper on 11 June 1949, Alan Turing said of the modern computer and artificial intelligence, \u2018This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be.\u2019\u00a0 He was prophetic and glimpsed and created a scientific future that few others, at that time, could imagine or understand. \u00a0He was a radical hero and we all owe him an enormous debt.\nAs we look to the future in the continuing fight for equality, the words of Alan Turing remain as relevant today as they did half a century ago, \u2018We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done\u2019.\u2019\n\nLike Turing, there are so many stories of Radical heroes told throughout the museum and still so many to be explored.\u00a0 People\u2019s History Museum is proud to honour so many Radicals who believe in ideas worth fighting for.\nPHM tells the stories of LGBT+ people and their battle for equality, celebrating the brave pioneers, activists and campaigners who took a stand for the right to simply be themselves. \u00a0PHM\u2019s main galleries shine a light on the political importance of being seen, and showcases the ways the LGBT+ movement has championed visibility.\nAs a charity, People\u2019s History Museum\u00a0relies on the generous support of our visitors.\u00a0

University (MMU) post graduate student Beth Lane shares insight from previously unseen Spanish Civil War photographs in PHM\u2019s internationally significant collection.\n\u2018\u2018We protest with all our power against the sham, the hypocritical sham, that it now appears to be.\u2019\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on 19 October 1936, the politician Philip Noel-Baker blasted the conservative government for advocating non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, which had erupted that same year. \u00a0This notion of protest, not only against the nationalist Francisco Franco and his forces in Spain, but against the staunch non-intervention motives of the government, became unanimous with the leftwing of Britain. \u00a0For example, Kenneth Sinclair-Loutit, a doctor who had treated casualties in the war, completely disregarded a threat of disinheritance from his father and volunteered anyway.\nThe Labour Party had originally supported the government\u2019s non-intervention, but when Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini\u2019s support for Franco was publicised, Labour leaders began to call for Britain to supply the Popular Front with military aid. \u00a0Some members of the party joined the International Brigades, although some of the more leftwing like Bob Edwards were part of the Independent Labour Party contingent. \u00a0Of the 2,000 British citizens who served with the Spanish Republican Army though, the majority were members of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).\nAlthough some notable literary figures volunteered, such as W H Auden, John Cornford, Stephen Spender, Christopher Caudwell and George Orwell, most of the men who went to Spain were working class, including many unemployed miners. \u00a0The majority of those who were moved to join and fight the war were not motivated by a privileged desire for rebellion, although several of the more notable names undoubtedly were. \u00a0They were moved by the desire for genuine protest against the threat of fascism, a reality which would crush the working class.\nOne man who certainly joined the fighting in protest of Franco\u2019s nationalist ideals was Bob Edwards. \u00a0On the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Edwards asked members of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) to volunteer to join the International Brigades. \u00a0Stafford Cottman was one of the men who offered his services, recalling \u2018I was asked to go along to their headquarters, and I met Bob Edwards who was its leader. \u00a0At the headquarters we were all interviewed by Bob and a couple of others. \u00a0They asked you simple things like why you wanted to go to Spain. \u00a0The idea was to find out whether you did have a sort of principle or whether it was pure adventure\u2019.\nThe effect that the war had on the future for Edwards and his political career is obvious. While some left Spain disillusioned, Edwards returned radical. \u00a0Years later he travelled to Spain again, protesting the imprisonment of political prisoners and distributing pamphlets pleading their case. \u00a0Originally under the guise of going on holiday, Edwards was questioned for ten hours by what he later called \u2018Franco\u2019s Gestapo\u2019. \u00a0A risky holiday indeed, considering the death sentence he was issued in 1939 should he ever return to Spain.\nThe British Independent Labour Party also sent a small contingent to fight in the Spanish Civil War. \u00a0The contingent fought alongside the Workers\u2019 Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) and included George Orwell, who wrote about his experiences in his personal account Homage to Catalonia. \u00a0Orwell was also comrade to Edwards; whose relationship was a frosty one indeed. \u00a0Orwell was not popular among fellow British militiamen either, who resented his \u2018cut-glass Eton accent\u2019.\nOne said he disliked this \u2018supercilious bastard\u2019 who \u2018really didn\u2019t like the workers\u2019. \u00a0Even the exiled Spanish Republican Prime Minister, Dr Juan Negrin, described Orwell\u2019s approach to the conflict and his book Homage to Catalonia as \u2018idealistic and unworldly\u2019. \u00a0The war had, in the years after it, affected comrades Edwards and Orwell in very different ways. \u00a0Orwell was disillusioned and depressed. \u00a0The result, said a sympathetic biographer, of \u2018his recognition that there was no more that he could do in Spain\u2019.\nThe fighting, which rumbled on from 1936 to 1939, wasn\u2019t the only conflict going on in Spain. Indeed, the relationship between comrades Edwards and Orwell was a very heated one.

while the other saw the outbreak of popular revolt as the unleashing of chaos and violence which did nothing but harm to the wellbeing of the populace.\nIt is interesting that both sides of the debate made use of the disruption of the French government to argue for opposite actions. \u00a0And political leaders in Lord Liverpool\u2019s government at the time were right to be wary of a relatively small skirmish in Manchester, as events on a similar scale elsewhere observably led to much bigger events.\u00a0 A skirmish on 12 July 1789 in the Tuileries Gardens in Paris led to the more famous events on 14 July, and within weeks, the collapse of the Old Regime in France.\u00a0 These events were influenced by a small popular reaction against government oppression that had happened across the Atlantic Ocean, in Boston, in March 1770.\u00a0 In all three cases, Boston, Paris and Manchester, the importance of the press in spreading the news was crucial.\nThe Boston Massacre on 5 March 1770 was the culmination of several years of protest by English colonists in British North America; a reaction to the increasing burden of taxation imposed by the government in London, and tariffs on items manufactured in Britain and shipped to the colonies. \u00a0However, without a representative voice in parliament, the colonists were unable to voice their dissent except through public protest.\u00a0 The Crown responded by sending troops to Boston, as the location of the headquarters of the new American Customs Board, to protect government officials and enforce the new laws.\u00a0 In February 1770, tensions peaked at the public funeral of an 11 year old boy who had been killed by a Customs employee.\u00a0 On 5 March, a crowd gathered in front of the Customs House, taunting the soldiers guarding it. One of the soldiers shot into the crowd, and soon three protestors were dead, two mortally wounded and six others shot.\u00a0 The Crown\u2019s troops were immediately withdrawn from the city and the colony\u2019s governor promised an enquiry. Eight soldiers, one officer and four civilians were arrested; only two of the soldiers were convicted of manslaughter (not murder) and were given a reduced sentence (branding).\nParliament in London was already in the process of repealing many of the hated taxes (except for the one on tea, with famous consequences), and troops were fully withdrawn from Boston by May 1770.\u00a0 However, the publication of accounts of the massacre in the Boston Gazette soon circulated throughout the thirteen colonies.\nAn engraving of the events by silversmith Paul Revere, a well known leader of colonial protest, stood out.\u00a0 Following the larger protest against taxation without representation known as the Boston Tea Party (December 1773), protest escalated into violence with skirmishes between the local militias and British troops at the nearby villages of Lexington and Concord (April 1775), a shocking Declaration of Independence (July 1776), and all out war.\nFrom December 1776, one of the leaders of this rebellion, Benjamin Franklin from Philadelphia, took American interests to France.\u00a0 Parisian salons were keen to learn of the latest developments in the expressions of liberty which had been so ardently cultivated in France.\u00a0 Several aristocrats notably the young Marquis de Lafayette, travelled to America to help.\u00a0 Lafayette became essentially the adopted son of the childless American Commander-in-Chief, George Washington.\nJust over a decade later, back in Paris, Lafayette was called on to restore order following a popular revolt against perceived government tyranny.\u00a0 As with Boston, the larger protest was sparked by a smaller, mostly forgotten skirmish, in the gardens of the Tuileries Palace on 12 July 1789.\u00a0 As with the American colonists, the demands of the people of France in spring 1789 were not initially to overthrow the royal government, but to reform it.\u00a0 Most people were fiercely loyal to their monarchy.\nBut the government was unable to function, due to a complete financial collapse, and an inability to pass reform measures in the Estates General.\u00a0 The King, Louis XVI, called this body to meet to hear the complaints and suggestions of delegates from all over France; but one fundamental question prevented them from even starting debate, the idea of whether the three estates (the clergy, the nobility and the commons) should vote by order (one each, as was traditional), or by head.\u00a0 The latter would mean that the Third Estate (the commons) would dominate any vote, overwhelmingly.\u00a0 On 17 June, the Third Estate proclaimed itself the National Assembly.\u00a0 The King tried to prevent them from meeting, so they found a large room in which tennis was played and swore an oath never to separate until a new constitution had been written for France.\nIn the midst of this political upheaval, France was also suffering from food shortages and skyrocketing prices.\u00a0 To try to maintain order Louis XVI ordered troops to Paris on 22 June and tried to get the Estates General to meet as before.\u00a0 This prompted the famous line by a leader of the newly self-proclaimed National Assembly, the Comte de Mirabeau, \u2018We are here by the will of the people, and won\u2019t leave but by the force of bayonets\u2019.\u00a0 Two tense weeks passed, and on 11 July, the Minister of Finance, Jacques Necker, the man seen by the majority of reformers and the Parisian crowds as the person who could fix the government\u2019s financial meltdown, resigned.\u00a0 Parisians took to the streets, angry that the King would not support Necker\u2019s plans for fiscal reforms, and at his calling in troops to surround their city.\nThe Prince of Lambesc, Charles-Eug\u00e8ne de Lorraine, was commander of a regiment of cavalry from the eastern part of France (the Royal Allemand), where many people spoke German.\u00a0 On 12 July, the Military Commander of Paris ordered Lambesc to take his troops into the city and to clear a huge crowd from the gardens in front of the Tuileries Palace (located directly opposite the Louvre).\u00a0 Trained for battle tactics, not crowd control, Lambesc and his soldiers clumsily set about the crowd with the flats of their swords.\u00a0 Some in the crowd threw bottles and chairs at the soldiers, and the violence escalated when soldiers from the Gardes Fran\u00e7aises, the King\u2019s own personal guard, some of whom were now in sympathy with the protestors, fought hand to hand with the dragoons from the Royal Allemand, whom many considered to be foreigners and the enemy of true patriots.\u00a0 Several people were injured, at least one person killed, and by the following day, the streets were filled with protesters.\u00a0 An ad hoc militia was formed to protect the people of Paris from the violence of their own government, and, in need of guns and ammunition, on 14 July, they took control of the main supply store in Paris, the Bastille fortress-prison.\u00a0 The King ordered the royal troops to withdraw, and agreed to the conversion of the French Guard into the National Guard, with Lafayette as their commander.\u00a0 He recalled Necker and travelled to Paris to acknowledge the start of the new order.\u00a0 But it was too late: as with the Boston Massacre of 1770, the cavalry charge at the Tuileries was quickly immortalised in prints which were distributed across the country and enflamed the nation.\n\nThrough the print above, and accounts in various newspapers across France, rather than restoring order, the King was seen to have attacked his own people.\u00a0 In October 1789, he was brought by force from Versailles to Paris, to be more directly accountable to the people for his decisions in government.\u00a0 After two years of attempts to forge a constitutional monarchy (along the lines of the British system), he was removed as head of state in September 1792, and executed the following January.\u00a0 Another republican experiment, like that in North America, was set to begin.\nThese events were in the minds of members of parliament in London in 1819.\u00a0 They would have remembered that the swift repression of popular protest in Boston and in Paris had not led to restored order, but to increased violence, and years of warfare.\u00a0 The impact of the French Revolution on Britain was finally brought to an end in 1815, with Napoleon\u2019s defeat at Waterloo.\u00a0 But the government of Lord Liverpool, who intriguingly had been present in Paris in July 1789, was not alone in its desire to keep slow reform from turning into revolution.\u00a0 It is important to see the events of Peterloo in the context of wider movements across Europe.\u00a0 In France, the recently restored monarchy had agreed to the Charte, a constitution limiting the power of the King, but conservatives bristled against it until it was virtually suspended under King Charles X, leading to his removal in the Second Revolution in July 1830.\u00a0 Other events contemporary to Peterloo demonstrate similar calls for political reforms: in Spain, the Revolt of the Cabezas de San Juan in January 1820 forced King Ferdinand VII to accept a constitution, and similar events transpired in Italy during the revolt of the Carbonari in Naples and Turin.\u00a0 In contrast, the Carlsbad Decrees by the Emperor Francis I in 1818 put a stop to reform movements all over Germany and the Austrian Empire.\u00a0 Further east, the Decembrist Revolt in Saint Petersburg in 1825 was led by 3,000 soldiers and civilians demanding a constitution and an end to serfdom, and was brutally put down by the Tsar\u2019s cavalry and artillery.\u00a0 Some estimates say as many as 1,000 people were killed.\n\nIt is against this background of several decades of revolt, reform and repression that the reactions of the British establishment to the violence in St Peter\u2019s Field, Manchester on 16 August 1819 should be viewed.\u00a0 The immediate action was the gagging of local newspapers and the forbidding of large public meetings.\u00a0 But in the longer term, public desire for genuine reform was too strong, and by the 1830s, a decade of peaceful reform emerged and Britain avoided the violent upheavals that shook most of the rest of Europe in the turbulent year of 1848.\u00a0 Indeed, the repeal in 1846 of the Corn Laws, the major motivation behind the Peterloo protests, allowed for a more peaceful petition for further reform by the Chartist movement to parliament in April 1848.\u00a0 But that is another anniversary year\u2026\u2019\n\nDisrupt? Peterloo and Protest exhibition is at PHM until Sunday 23 February 2020 as part of PHM\u2019s year long programme exploring the past, present and future of protest, marking 200 years since the Peterloo Massacre; a major event in Manchester\u2019s history, and a defining moment for Britain\u2019s democracy.\n"}, {"link": "https://phm.org.uk/blogposts/marion-wallace-dunlap-inspires-success-in-burnley/", "category": "", "title": "History inspires success in Burnley", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-07-05 00:00:00", "text": "#OnThisDay in 1909 suffragette Marion Wallace Dunlop went on hunger strike whilst imprisoned for militancy. \u00a0She became one of the first and most well known to do so and her tactics were to inspire the likes of Ghandi. \u00a0We asked Lynne Blackburn, Director & Project Manager at Participation Works NW to share a recent project which saw a group of girls from Burnley inspired for their futures by struggles that women in the past faced.\n\u2018I have learnt to appreciate what women fought so hard for in the past.\u2019 Happy and Proud project participant\n\u2018The Happy and Proud project uses the stories and heritage of northern women such as Marion Wallace Dunlop to raise the aspirations of girls living across Burnley communities.\u00a0 Our young women of the future have researched the struggles that women in the past faced and overcame to achieve their goals in life.\u00a0 They have recorded their findings through textiles, film, art, photography and design.\nThe Happy and Proud project girls have not only learned a range of new skills as part of the project;

Through the process of digital photography, poster design, and zine making, the pupils learnt how to use the power of visual communication to interact with an issue.\nAt the beginning of the project I accompanied fifteen Year eight pupils and their art teacher Liz Jackson from Abraham Moss Community School on a visit to PHM, the national museum of democracy, to learn about and be inspired by the ideas worth fighting for, ideas such as equality, social justice, co-operation and a fair world for all. an insight on social issues and historical moments in Britain and Manchester. \u00a0We took part in a creative writing workshop, focusing on how to express ideas and the use of words to present a narrative. \u00a0This allowed the students to actively engage in the power of communication.\nOur main focus was on the range of different protest campaign; how banners and posters and imagery was used to present issues and have a say. We also spoke about zines as a tool for the dissemination of ideas, being a quick and cheap way to present ideas and images.\nBack at school the students staff members on the issues of plastic waste, recycling and climate change.\u00a0 They looked into human damage around their school. \u00a0We visited the school canteen and playground areas; these recreational areas were thought to be the most likely to find people and objects to investigate. \u00a0The students utilised iPads loaded with questions they planned to ask and the issues they wanted their peers to think about. \u00a0They videoed and documented the responses and photographed how the pupils treated their spaces. \u00a0Thought our walk around the school they discovered why people mistreated their surroundings.\nWe continued the project by making their own statement posters with image and text highlighting everyday modern activism in a digital society. The students learnt the basics of how to manipulate an image (e.g. crop, colour correcting, adding filters etc.) using Photoshop.\u00a0 We asked them to think about how a photographer can change images. They combined text with the images they had taken during the previous session and added their thoughts and tips to improve or what they cared about. They used their poster to present the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts and facts on the issues.\nAbraham Moss High School CDDIR project poster by Wajeehs, Arbris and Sahifa\nThe next activity involved Zine making. \u00a0Using a combination of newspapers, different papers, photos they took and text from the interviews to create a zine which illustrates things to improve how we treat the environment and their school.\nOur project ended with a visit to the School of Art at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU). It was a great chance to show the students the multifaceted world of an art and design world. \u00a0It was a day in which we explored the art school and all the variety of disciplines as an art student you can do. \u00a0The main focus was to give the students insight on what a creative career can be and introduce them to recent photography graduate, Nathan Cutler who spoke about his experiences as a photographer and past student. \u00a0We also met undergraduate, Molly Darlington who is working as professional sports photographer alongside her studies. \u00a0It was a chance for students to ask questions about their own creative career path. \u00a0We also shared with them the work we had done.\nBoth the tour at MMU and meeting with these young professionals who have developed careers in the arts have showed them tangible career paths within the digital design and art sectors. Showing them that a career in the art world is possible and achievable. Also giving the teachers information on different paths a creative can take and that there isn\u2019t just one way!\nAnd in the words of Liz Jackson, Art Teacher, Abraham Moss Community School:\n\u2018This year\u2019s CDDIR project focused on the idea of collective protest. \u00a0We chose to create artwork that would raise the awareness of environment protection and improvement, focusing specifically on ways we can improve our school environment. \u00a0These sophisticated outcomes will now be distributed around school and presented as posters in the dining areas to help inspire pupils to consider how the can make a positive impact on their school environment. \u00a0The project was enjoyed by all the pupils who were involved. Their understanding of the theme and their commitment to choosing Art as a GCSE subject next year, has increased as a result of the project. \u00a0I look forward to developing the protests further within school, working alongside the PVLP (Pupil Voice group) and the pupils involved in the project to promote environmental concerns in school.\u2019\nThe project has been a great success.\u00a0 The pupils have learnt new skills combining photography, Photoshop, drawing and text which they can apply to their work, or use in the future and they are more aware on how to present their ideas and protest on current issues.\u2019\n\nPHM\u2019s year long programme for 2019 explores the past, present and future of protest, marking 200 years since the Peterloo Massacre; a major event in Manchester\u2019s history, and a defining moment for Britain\u2019s democracy.\nAt PHM we offer an engaging Learning Programme, providing opportunities for early years, schools, colleges, universities, adult and community groups, and families to learn about, be inspired by and get involved in ideas worth fighting for; ideas such as equality, social justice, co-operation, and a fair world for all.\nVisit the\u00a0Learn\u00a0section of the museum\u2019s website for all the information you need to arrange a visit, or \u00a0please contact the Learning Team on\u00a0learning@phm.org,uk\u00a0or call 0161 838 9190.\n"}, {"link": "https://phm.org.uk/blogposts/50-miles-100-voices-200-years/", "category": "", "title": "50 Miles, 100 Voices, 200 Years", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-06-07 00:00:00", "text": "To complement the performance of a specially commissioned song that celebrates the story of the Skelmanthorpe flag, on loan from Tolson Museum, on display in PHM\u2019s Disrupt?

However, only singing the song, brilliant though it is, didn\u2019t feel like it was enough. \u00a0The project grew. \u00a0We also wanted to sing with other choirs from both sides of the Pennines. \u00a0So we are performing with SHE Choir, Open Voices and WAST (Women Asylum Seekers Together) from Manchester, and Shepley Singers from Yorkshire. \u00a0We also wanted to include a physical expression of solidarity, so we\u2019re making a replica of the Skelmanthorpe flag, (the original Skelmanthorpe flag is currently on display in People\u2019s History Museum\u2019s (PHM) exhibition, Disrupt? Peterloo and Protest until Sunday 23 February 2020), and we are going to carry the replica across the Pennines on a three-day, 50 mile walk, camping as we go and inviting anyone who wants to join us to do so at any point along the way for as much or as little of it they like.\nWe\u2019ll be bringing our replica flag on foot all the way from its home village of Skelmanthorpe on Thursday 4 July to the site of the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester city centre on Saturday 6 July. \u00a0Along with our replica flag, we\u2019re going to carry flags made by choir members and also flags made by participants of PHM\u2019s monthly Fabric of Protest workshops. \u00a0Inspired by the range of issues illustrated on the Skelmanthorpe flag, people are coming up with all sorts of slogans and images that represent what they care about today; they\u2019re going to look wonderful as they\u2019re carried across the hills.\nIt\u2019s been a lot of fun developing this project. \u00a0The flag workshops have generated a lot of lively discussion and a lot of laughter. \u00a0At the start, people were a bit lost where to begin, with so much to protest about or to celebrate today.\u00a0 But after some chat and some thought, most people would home in on one thing and then they\u2019d be unstoppable until they\u2019d turned out a beautiful flag that says something important.\nAnd while some of us have been creating flags, Boff Whalley and Jane Morland have been working with all the singers involved, producing fabulous harmonies. \u00a0Other choir members have been walking across the hills, occasionally getting lost, to painstakingly map out routes for the flags\u2019 journey. \u00a0People are organising lifts, planning campsite dinners for hungry walkers and making connections. \u00a0Even before we\u2019ve done the walk great things have been happening, and we hope that by the time we arrive fresh from our walk for our final performance at People\u2019s History Museum on Sunday 7 July at 3.00pm the atmosphere will be even more unruly, joyful and celebratory.\u2019\n\nCommoners Choir, Shepley Singers, SHE Choir, WAST and Open Voices will be performing the specially commissioned song at PHM on Sunday 7 July at 3.00pm as part of the museum\u2019s year long programme exploring the past, present and future of protest, marking 200 years since the Peterloo Massacre.\u00a0 Tickets \u00a34.\u00a0 Booking essential.\nFor further information about the walking route and performance times in Skelmanthorpe and Manchester, visit www.commonerschoir.com.\nThe Skelmanthorpe flag, on loan from Tolson Museum, is on display in PHM\u2019s exhibition\u00a0Disrupt?

Peterloo and Protest exhibition were acquired thanks to a joint National Lottery Heritage Fund (NLHF) grant with Salford\u2019s Working Class Movement Library (WCML).\u00a0 To celebrate the opening of the Library\u2019s Peterloo: news, fake news and paranoia exhibition, we asked Lynette Cawthra, Working Class Movement Library Manager to talk about the project which gave both institutions funds to go \u2026.\n\u2018Salford\u2019s Working Class Movement Library (WCML) was delighted to be successful in 2014 jointly with the People\u2019s History Museum (PHM) in getting a National Lottery Heritage Fund (NLHF) grant for a Collecting Cultures project. \u00a0This award gave both institutions five years of funding for new acquisitions, and created opportunities to encourage visitors to find out more about them.\nThe project, Voting for Change \u2013 150 years of radical movements for democracy, 1819 to 1969, built on the complementary strengths of both organisations\u2019 collections to acquire material related to movements and campaigns for the vote, from the build up to the Peterloo Massacre in 1819 to the lowering of the voting age in 1969 to 18 years old. \u00a0The focus of this project has been on the grassroots movements for political reform from which Britain\u2019s successive extensions of the franchise may be traced.\u00a0 The Library, which is free and open for everyone to use, has a distinctive perspective on the making of Britain\u2019s democracy which is from the bottom up \u2013 its particular focus is on networks of activists and campaigners, from the early 1800s up to the present day.\nAt the core of the WCML collection is of course the written word, and as part of this project we have been thrilled to have been able to acquire at auction two great treasures.\u00a0 The first is an original edition of Percy Bysshe Shelley\u2019s poem The Masque of Anarchy, as featured on this blog in March 2019.\nThe second is linked to the fight for women\u2019s suffrage and specifically to Sylvia Pankhurst.\u00a0 Thanks to NLHF we are now the owners of a beautifully preserved volume of the weekly newspaper The Woman\u2019s Dreadnought, covering March 1915 to March 1916.\u00a0 Priced at a halfpenny The Woman\u2019s Dreadnought, published by the East London Federation of the Suffragettes (ELFS) and edited by Sylvia Pankhurst, covered a wide range of topics of interest to working women.\u00a0 The ELFS led community action to support those most affected by the sudden wave of unemployment in London\u2019s East End caused by the start of World War I. \u00a0They organised the distribution of baby milk, opened restaurants serving nutritious food at cost price, and even started up a co-operative toy factory which paid a living wage and included a cr\u00e8che.\u00a0 Sylvia printed articles by very many campaigners in the feminist, socialist, anti-war and revolutionary movements of the time, and the authorities considered The Woman\u2019s Dreadnought to be so dangerously radical that its offices were subject to several police raids.\nOver the five years of the project we have been able to acquire many other noteworthy additions to WCML\u2019s collection. \u00a0One of the earliest was a rare and most unusual archive of election material from 1835. \u00a0The material details the expenses of a Lincolnshire Conservative Party candidate, Thomas George Corbett, including amounts spent on alcohol, tobacco and wagons to get his voters to the hustings.\nThe Library is also now the proud owner of two volumes of cartoons by Francis Carruthers Gould dealing with the general elections of 1895 and 1900, when the two established parties were having to adjust to the need to appeal to working class male voters as a result of the 1867 and 1884 Reform Acts.\u00a0\u00a0 More visual appeal was provided by the acquisition of an artistic autograph album with a suffragette twist.\n\nAlongside printed material, both political and creative including a novel from 1910 which adds a further cultural dimension to our women\u2019s suffrage collections, the Library has been lucky enough to acquire several artefacts, such as a Votes for Women sash and several beautiful women\u2019s suffrage badges.\nThese acquisitions helped set the scene for a group of students from St Ambrose Barlow Roman Catholic High School in Swinton, Salford who developed a performance, Forward, Sister Women! sharing creative reflections on the women\u2019s suffrage movement in relation to contemporary female activism.\nOther WCML Voting for Change project events have included:\n\nWorking on the project with PHM has been really interesting.\u00a0 The Library has had a representative on PHM\u2019s Acquisitions Panel, thereby developing insights into both the decision making processes of a larger organisation and into the huge range of material they get offered!\u00a0 Volunteers and staff from both organisations have also travelled together on a research trip to Glasgow, visiting the Glasgow Women\u2019s Library and the People\u2019s Palace. \u00a0And we\u2019ve been really grateful to get some specialist support from PHM\u2019s superb Conservation Team, particularly in relation to a beautiful, but rather dilapidated, scrapbook of hand-coloured cartoons about the 1832 Reform Act.\nLooking back, I\u2019ve had my particular favourite items.\u00a0 One is a fantastically ephemeral item, a single sheet showing the swearing in of a special constable in the run up to the big Chartist gathering on Kennington Common in London in 1848, as the authorities got jittery about the potential for major civil unrest.\u00a0 The other is an exquisitely illustrated children\u2019s book Votes for Catharine Susan and Me, by author and illustrator Kathleen Ainslie. \u00a0It\u2019s not entirely clear which side Ainslie was on \u2013 is she mocking her wooden peg doll heroines as they join the struggle to win the franchise? \u00a0However, her decision to give women\u2019s suffrage campaigning such prominence in a children\u2019s picture book of around 1910 certainly makes this acquisition very distinctive indeed.\nIt\u2019s been a great five years \u2013 and we still have six months of the project to go.\u00a0 The Library is looking forward to opening our own Peterloo exhibition and displaying The Masque of Anarchy on Friday 31 May \u2013 Peterloo: news, fake news and paranoia, and there are exciting plans afoot to end the project with a finale event marking the bicentenary of Thomas Paine\u2019s bones nearly arriving in Manchester.\u00a0 Sign up to WCML\u2019s fortnightly free e-bulletin if you\u2019d like to be kept abreast of that extraordinary story.\nIf you want to see any of these new acquisitions, or just fancy popping in to find out more about the Library, you can find our opening hours and how to contact us on WCML\u2019s website.\u2019\nLynette Cawthra, Library Manager, Working Class Movement Library\nPHM\u2019s exhibition Disrupt? Peterloo and Protest, on show until Sunday 23 February 2020, tells the story of Peterloo through eight original Peterloo artefacts, which have been brought together for the very first time.\u00a0 The objects include pieces from PHM\u2019s collection, new acquisitions and pieces that are on loan from other organisations (including a book from WCML). \u00a0Five of the objects are on display thanks to the Collecting Cultures project from the National Lottery Heritage Fund.\n"}, {"link": "https://phm.org.uk/blogposts/protest-playlist-a-djs-mancunian-highlights/", "category": "", "title": "Protest playlist: A DJ's Mancunian highlights", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-05-24 00:00:00", "text": "We\u2019re exploring the past, present and future of protest throughout 2019, and have compiled our own protest playlist.\u00a0 Here our friend, curator, DJ and co-founder of Manchester Digital Music Archive, Abigail Ward shares her highlights from Manchester\u2019s history of rebel music.\n\u2018Music, politics and protest are inextricably entangled. \u00a0As a curator, DJ and co-founder of Manchester Digital Music Archive, I love to explore the place at which all three meet.\nThere are many moments in Manchester\u2019s history when making music, dancing or simply coming together in a club have been acts of resistance, or a form of defiant visibility for oppressed communities. \u00a0Often, protest songs from elsewhere have been part of these moments of disruption, but sometimes original songs were birthed here too.\nSteel Pulse at the National Carnival Against the Nazis, 1978 \u00a9 John Sturrock\nA turning point in our city\u2019s fight against racism and fascism occurred on 15 July 1978 at the Northern Carnival Against the Nazis held in Alexandra Park, Moss Side. \u00a0Approximately 40,000 people from different communities across Britain came together to protest against the National Front and other racist groups. \u00a0Manchester punk heroes Buzzcocks performed, as did Birmingham\u2019s Steel Pulse, who shocked the crowd by playing their protest song Ku Klux Klan in full Klan regalia. \u00a0Follow this link to watch a film about this momentous day.\nMoss Side\u2019s fertile black music scene of that era also gave rise to reggae band Harlem Spirit, who in 1980 released one of Manchester\u2019s greatest protest songs, Dem A Sus, which was written about the controversial stop and search (\u2018sus\u2019) laws that were being used at that time to target young black men in Hulme and Moss Side. \u00a0Sus laws were cited as one the key factors in the Moss Side riots of 1981.\n\nAround the same time Buzzcocks singer Pete Shelley released Homosapien, a song about queer male love. \u00a0The song is typical of Pete\u2019s style in that it is fizzing with excitement and cheek, but perhaps isn\u2019t direct enough to be considered a true protest song. \u00a0It did, however get banned by the BBC, allegedly for the line \u2018Homosuperior in my interior\u2019.\n\nUndeniably influenced by Pete Shelley, Morrissey emerged in 1983 as Manchester\u2019s new queer agitator, but it was a later paean to vegetarianism, Meat Is Murder, that became his most plain speaking protest song:\n\u2018And the flesh you so fancifully fry,\nIs not succulent, tasty or kind,\nIt\u2019s death for no reason,\nAnd death for no reason is murder\u2019.\nWords that may well have impressed William Cowherd and Joseph Brotherton, two Salford activists who were instrumental in setting up the Vegetarian Society in 1847. \u00a0Another feather in radical Manchester\u2019s cap.\n\nFebruary 1988 saw one of Manchester\u2019s biggest ever demonstrations, the Stop the Clause march, organised to oppose the enactment of Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, which banned local authorities from \u2018promoting homosexuality as a pretended family relationship\u2019.\u00a0 Attended by approximately 20,000 people, the march was a pivotal moment in UK LGBT+ history and led to the explosion of queer clubbing in Manchester known as \u2018Gaychester\u2019.\nAt the rally in Albert Square in front of Manchester\u2019s Town Hall, punk musician and activist Tom Robinson performed his protest anthem Glad to be Gay, altering the words to include reference to Manchester\u2019s then Chief Constable James Anderton, a Christian zealot who had described those affected by HIV and AIDS as \u2018swirling around in a cesspool of their own making\u2019.\nYou can see Tom performing at the Stop the Clause march here, 12 minutes in:\n\nAs a DJ, one of my most played seven inches is Chicago / We Can Change The World by Salford songwriter and activist, Graham Nash. \u00a0The lyrics of the song refer to the anti-Vietnam War demonstration that took place during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago and the subsequent trial of the Chicago Eight.\u00a0 Cherished for its massive groove as much as its message, Chicago has since been sampled by numerous hip hop artists including Rascalz & KRS-One.\n\nNash also performed with Crosby, Stills and Young on the latter\u2019s Ohio, which was described by The Guardian in 2010 as the \u2018greatest protest song of all time\u2019. \u00a0Explicitly critical of the the US President Richard Nixon\u2019s administration, the song concerned the Kent State shootings of 1970 in which four unarmed students were gunned down by the Ohio National Guard during a protest against the bombing of Cambodia by US military forces.\nEwan MacCcoll, another world famous Salfordian, is considered one of the most acute social commentators in English folk music. \u00a0His protest songs are legion, but The Manchester Rambler from 1932 is a particular favourite, inspired by the Kinder Mass Trespass by the Young Communist League of Manchester:\n\u2018He said \u201cAll this land is my master\u2019s\u201d\nAt that I stood shaking my head\nNo man has the right to own mountains\nAny more than the deep ocean bed\u2019\nThese tracks are just a few highlights in Manchester\u2019s history of rebel music. \u00a0But which Manchester musicians are letting their freak flag fly in 2019? \u00a0Sadly, not very many prominent ones. \u00a0But the underground scene is healthy.\nILL are a fierce female four-piece purveying genre-bending disobedient noise. \u00a0Their track Kremlin is about Pussy Riot:\n\u2018What\u2019s big and red and throbbing?\nThe shadow of the Kremlin.\nWhat\u2019s tall hot and nervous?\nThe perverts in Congress\nShall we just sit here\nDiscuss the semantics\nAnd let these baboons go on with their antics?\u2019\nContemporaries of ILL, Cabbage burst onto the scene a few years ago with filthy hair and a good line in scattershot political rhetoric. \u00a0Their 2016 track Uber Capitalist Death Trade exemplifies their lyrical approach, which is at times reminiscent of under appreciated Manchester post-punk band Big Flame.\n\nBig Flame were a huge influence on Welsh rock dissenters Manic Street Preachers.\u00a0 In a 1991 interview Richey Edwards of Manic Street Preachers said, \u2018The 80s, for us, was the biggest non-event ever. \u00a0All we had was Big Flame. \u00a0Big Flame was the most perfect band. \u00a0But we couldn\u2019t play their records \u2018cos they were too avant garde.\u2019\n\nThe Manics themselves are no strangers to a protest song.\u00a0 Their surprise 1998 number one hit about the Spanish Civil War (1936 \u2013 1939), If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next, was inspired by the idealism of Welsh volunteers who joined the leftwing International Brigades fighting for the Spanish Republic against Francisco Franco\u2019s military rebels. \u00a0Its stand out line \u2018if I can shoot rabbits, then I can shoot fascists\u2019 was taken from the book Miners Against Fascism by Hywel Francis.\nThe track is featured on PHM\u2019s new protest playlist, along with a number of other protest songs touched upon in this piece. \u00a0Dive in below!\u2019\n\nPart of PHM\u2019s year long programme exploring the past, present and future of protest, marking 200 years since the Peterloo Massacre; a major event in Manchester\u2019s history, and a defining moment for Britain\u2019s democracy.\nPeople\u2019s History Museum is open seven days a week from 10.00am to 5.00pm, and is free to enter with a suggested

PHM we\u2019re commemorating 200 years since the Peterloo Massacre; a major event in Manchester\u2019s history, and a defining moment for Britain\u2019s democracy.\u00a0 We asked Katie Belshaw, Curator of Industrial Heritage down the road at Science and Industry Museum to provide some context about early 19th century Manchester\u2019s expanding cotton industry.\n\u2018Many thousands of cotton industry workers from Manchester and its surrounding towns were present at the immense but peaceful gathering which took place at St Peter\u2019s Field on 16 August 1819, which culminated in the death of at least 18 people and the injury of around 700 hundred more, when mounted soldiers attacked the gathered crowds. \u00a0That so many of the estimated 60,000 who assembled to hear Henry Hunt speak were employed in the cotton industry reflects the levels of disenfranchisement felt by the people whose labour was driving Manchester\u2019s industrial transformation in the first decades of the 19th century.\nBy 1819, Manchester\u2019s cotton industry was booming. \u00a0Huge, multi-storey, steam powered cotton spinning mills had arrived in the town, many clustered around the burgeoning industrial suburb of Ancoats, where thousands of mill workers lived cheek by jowl alongside the factories. \u00a0New machine innovations and ambitious entrepreneurs who saw the profit-making potential of cotton spinning had transformed the processing of raw cotton into yarn in less than a generation. \u00a0Manchester\u2019s largest cotton employers were brothers Adam and George Murray of Ancoats, whose spinning mill employed over 1,200 people, and their neighbours James McConnel and John Kennedy, with over 1,000 workers. \u00a0Mechanised cotton spinning had also taken hold in neighbouring communities like Ashton, Bury, Oldham and Stockport.\nMeanwhile, the weaving of yarn into finished cloth remained largely a domestic industry, carried out on handlooms in homes or small workshops in Manchester and its surrounding towns. Powered looms were in development and gradually being adopted by manufacturers, but it was only in the proceeding decade that the technology advanced enough to produce results comparable to the cloth made by skilled handloom weavers, which finally resulted in the wholescale transfer of weaving from home to steam powered factory.\nBy the first decades of the 19th century, exports of cloth made in Manchester and its surrounding towns were flooding markets across the world and the cotton industry was providing work to almost one third of Lancashire\u2019s population. \u00a0Manchester started to attract the attention of visitors from far and wide, who came to witness its burgeoning industrial transformation. \u00a0A swiss industrialist, Hans Escher, visiting Manchester in 1814, was impressed by the town\u2019s new cotton mills, enthusing;\n\u2018The spinning mills are now working until 8pm by (gas) light. \u00a0Unless one has seen it for one\u2019s self, it is impossible to imagine how grand is the sight of a big cotton mill when a fa\u00e7ade of 256 windows is lit as if the brightest sunshine were streaming through the windows.\u2019\nThe new cotton mills were the largest, most technologically advanced buildings of their day, entirely brick-built, gas-lit and powered by thunderous steam engines. \u00a0Yet other witnesses painted a far less romantic picture of Manchester\u2019s new factories. \u00a0In 1818, an article in the radical publication Black Dwarf condemned the exhausting working hours enforced by cotton mill owners;\n\u2018The workmen\u2026are trained to work from six years old, from five in a morning to eight and nine at night\u2026 There they are\u2026locked up until night\u2026 and allowed no time, except three-quarters of an hour for dinner in the whole day.\u2019\nWinter or summer, rain or shine, the factory bell summoned thousands of workers to the mills for gruelling days of up to 15 hours labour, six days a week. \u00a0Many people also deplored the young age at which children were sent to work. \u00a0Starting as young as six, they toiled for the same long hours as adults, working as scavengers, sweeping beneath fast-moving machinery, or as piecers, fixing broken threads on the spinning machines. \u00a0Spinners were largely men, whilst women worked on winding machines, or in the carding room, preparing cotton for spinning.\u00a0 Common to almost all mill tasks was their dull and repetitive nature, organised around the monotonous rhythm of the factory machines. \u00a0Mill discipline was maintained with a system of petty fines, punishments and forced dismissals.\nCompounding the demanding hours of labour, harsh discipline and monotony of work, mill temperatures could reach unbearable highs and the humid air, thick with cotton dust, caused many workers breathing problems and lung disease. \u00a0A surgeon, Dr Ward, who visited a Manchester cotton mill in 1819 reported that he \u2018could not remain ten minutes in the factory without gasping for breath\u2019. \u00a0He was astonished at mill workers\u2019 ability to bear the conditions for such long hours. \u00a0Working amongst the roaring machines without protection, many workers also experienced hearing loss and with no guarding on the fast-moving machines, injuries, particularly to mills\u2019 youngest workers, were all too common.\nIn the years leading up to Peterloo, thousands of Manchester\u2019s mill workers petitioned employers for fairer wages, a reduction in working hours and the regulation of child labour. \u00a0\u00a0In the summer of 1818, striking spinners picketed cotton mills, attacking what they saw as the tyrannical and oppressive capitalism of mill owners. \u00a0They argued that their average wage had dropped from 24 shillings a week in 1815 to 18 shillings in 1818. \u00a0One target of the 1818 action was the cotton mill of Hugh Hornby Birley, Captain of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry, who would go on to lead the charge into the crowds at Peterloo. \u00a0Known for his particularly harsh treatment of workers, 200 strikers surrounded Birley\u2019s factory and threw stones.\nThousands of handloom weavers shared the discontent of factory spinners, mounting their own strikes in response to falling wages.\u00a0 They were particularly concerned about the gradual adoption of powered looms, which they predicted would replace their skills and take away their livelihoods. \u00a0Evidence of wages prepared for the prosecution at the trials following Peterloo showed that some handloom weavers were earning just six shillings a week in 1819. \u00a0When a pound each of butter, cheese, potatoes, onions and mutton cost almost four shillings, it is not surprising that many handloom weavers subsisted on a meagre diet of potatoes or oatmeal mixed with salt.\nIn 1819, then, the workers driving forward Manchester\u2019s industrial transformation were bitterly disillusioned. \u00a0Whilst capitalist manufacturers reaped the rewards of the cotton industry, the men and women who sustained their profits felt oppressed and unrepresented. Angry at their inability to make themselves heard, they gathered in their thousands on 16 August at St Peter\u2019s Field, to demand a voice.\u2019\n\nPHM\u2019s exhibition\u00a0Disrupt?

Starting in April and carrying on until early July various cities erupted into violence; Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and London all fought for top spot on the news each night, or so it seemed. \u00a0Then it just stopped, seriously, just stopped. There was a wedding on telly. \u00a0Wednesday 29 July, the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, got married. \u00a0Some people had the day off work, 2.5 million people didn\u2019t have a job so we were not asked. \u00a0We just stayed at home.\nPolitical vocabulary is constantly evolving, and it is not a retrospective re-write on my part but I did notice it at the time. \u00a0Certain phrases kept cropping up in TV interviews and in the printed press, \u2018inward investment\u2019, \u2018flexible economy\u2019, \u2018deregulation\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0 Translated they mean, selling companies to the highest foreign bidder, making it easier to sack people, and getting rid of nationalised stuff. \u00a0My personal favourite was \u2018rationalisation\u2019, the outcome of which was some poor sod working longer hours for less money. \u00a0As I did in my first job, stacking wood in a factory, not a job, more of a task. \u00a0From 8.00am to 4.30pm Monday to Friday I stood behind a saw machine with five blades on it, imaginatively called a Five Cutter, and as somebody fed in the planks of wood from the front, they were cut into strips and I took them off the back and stacked them on a wooden palate. \u00a0And that was it, all day every day.\nThe wood was from South East Asia and called Keruing, it was usually damp and stank, the factory as whole was hot and damp at the same time, the noise was so bad from the various machines that we had to wear ear protectors. \u00a0There was an ever present fine wood dust in the air, as well as the constant need to dodge flying chips of wood that came off the back of band saws that were lined up about 15 feet away from me.\nFor this dear reader I was paid \u00a31 per hour, yep, one of your English pounds per hour. \u00a0I took home \u00a339 per week, I made so little that I didn\u2019t actually pay tax, and when Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Chancellor of the Exchequer feels sorry for you it\u2019s fair to say your wage level is not good. \u00a0If I worked a Saturday morning my wages rocketed to \u00a344 per week. \u00a0Oh and I lived two miles from the factory, there were no buses, all \u2018deregulated\u2019 so I walked there and back each day.\nOn 12 April 2018 I attended a memorial service at Westminster Central Hall, it was for Rodney Bickerstaffe, former Trustee of People\u2019s History Museum, founder of UNISON trade union, and along with the Birmingham MP Clare Short, one of the main architects of the National Minimum Wage Act of 1998. \u00a0It is perhaps not right to leave a memorial service in an angry mood but somehow I managed it.\nI couldn\u2019t help thinking of all the pointless and unnecessary deaths of young people there had been in the years prior to the minimum wage. \u00a0I found myself thinking of a particularly revolting government scheme, introduced in 1978 by the Labour government of James Callaghan, but taken up with a telling enthusiasm by the government of Margaret Thatcher, called the Youth Opportunities Programme (YOP) and how lucky I was not to have been on one. \u00a0If you were between 16 and 18 years old you worked in exactly the sort of job I was doing and the government paid the wages, all \u00a323.50 of it, yep there were people earning less than me! \u00a0You did it for a year on the vague promise, very vague, that there would be a full time job for you at the end of it. \u00a0Of course they very often failed to materialise. \u00a0But between 1978 and 1982 24 young people, mainly boys all under 18, were killed on YOP schemes, on building sites, or factories doing exactly the sort of job I was doing.\nI got involved in something called The Youth Trade Union Rights Campaign and since then, well, I have never really looked forward!\nAnyway I am going to stop writing now as a Deliveroo person on a bike is brining me my tea. \u00a0So glad we live in a gig economy and not a \u2018flexible\u2019 one where people are worked to the bone for low wages!\nMoral

"To complement the display of a portrait of Hugh Hornby Birley, who as captain of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry played a central role in the events that unfolded at the Peterloo Massacre, we asked author Jeff Kaye to share his research on Birley from his forthcoming novel All the People and treat us to an excerpt about the painting, now in People\u2019s History Museum\u2019s (PHM) collection.\n\u2018It may be hard for us to imagine the carnage at St Peter\u2019s Field at the Peterloo Massacre on 16 August 1819, when the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry led by Captain Hugh Hornby Birley rode into the crowd, sabres cutting, killing men, women and a child, injuring almost 700.\nThereafter, the survivors and their supporters who wished to commemorate the tragedy of Peterloo were not allowed near the site of their grief. \u00a0The field was blockaded by the 15th King\u2019s Hussars, the regiment that supported the yeomanry into battle in 1819, stationed nearby at Hulme Barracks.\nTherefore, on each anniversary of Peterloo, crowds of working people would gather outside a house in Mosley Street and also at Chorlton Mill, now apartments at the junction of Cambridge Street and Hulme Street. \u00a0There, they would jeer at the symbols of the man that led the charge at Peterloo, the faceless buildings owned by Hugh Hornby Birley.\nThe authorities considered him guiltless and it was not until April 1822 that a private prosecution was brought by Thomas Redford, a Middleton hatter, against the promoted Major Birley and others, for \u2018assault\u2019 at St Peter\u2019s Field. \u00a0The prosecution failed and Birley must have believed that, at 44 years of age, the shadow of Peterloo had lifted.\n\nBirley was already a successful businessman in Manchester, based on the success of Chorlton Mill, the area\u2019s main employer. \u00a0He was also a civic leader, the founder of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce and spokesman for the Manchester Association of Master Manufacturers. \u00a0He used this platform to vigorously oppose Ten-Hour reform: his reputation as the harshest of employers was well earned. \u00a0He also despised interference by the state into his private affairs, except for the wholesale reduction of the tax on corn because he considered taxation was required to fund his cherished military.\nAs the Treasurer of the Lying-in Hospital (later transformed into St Mary\u2019s Hospital on Oxford Road, Manchester) for 30 years, he may also have considered himself a philanthropist, if a giver of time rather than his money. \u00a0But this was insufficient to persuade working people to suspend their hatred. \u00a0Indeed, many of Birley\u2019s own class thought him contemptible, including Archibald Prentice, Editor of The Manchester Times newspaper and Founder of the Anti-Corn Law League with Richard Cobden. \u00a0Cobden donated land at St Peter\u2019s Field for the building of the Free Trade Hall; considered a cenotaph to Peterloo and a snub to Birley.\nBirley attempted to build a wall of respectability to change memories. \u00a0His business activities, work for the town and his philanthropy were likely designed, at least partly, to alter how he was remembered rather than compensate for any guilt, which he never admitted. \u00a0Such efforts were doomed to fail. \u00a0In 1842, cotton mill workers, striking over starvation wages and the Chartist cause of universal suffrage, came to Chorlton Mill. \u00a0Throughout the Plug Plot Riots of 1842, other mills across the North West closed without a fight, but Birley\u2019s mill was defended vigorously against the strikers with water hoses fired and masonry thrown from the roof, causing the death of a young girl. \u00a0The mill was nevertheless closed.\nAs the strikes ebbed, the Northern Star newspaper, in its Peterloo commemoration edition of 20 August 1842, printed the engraving published by journalist and agitator Richard Carlile of the Peterloo Massacre on its front page with the description, \u2018The accompanying engraving represents the horrible scene, just when the \u2018heroes\u2019 were hard at work. \u00a0Let the \u2018heroes\u2019 look upon it and refresh their memories respecting their courageous \u2018deeds in arms\u2019.\u2019\nFeargus O\u2019Connor, the newspaper\u2019s Editor and Chartist leader, listed all the members of the yeomanry present on 16 August 1819, headed by: \u2018Hugh Hornby Birley, Commander.\u2019\nIn my forthcoming novel, All the People, a story of the fight for survival and universal suffrage by the people in Manchester, the heart of the industrial revolution, Birley reads the article in shock. \u00a0He had decided to return permanently to Broom House, his country home in Weaste in Salford together with his painting that had hung in his office. \u00a0He knows that his life\u2019s efforts to erase the memory of one terrible act have been futile and rips the newspaper to pieces with a knife, then:\n\u2018He walked to his painting\u2026Yes, he had looked mightily content with himself, he thought, all those years ago, self-confident and secure, almost overbearing in his towering self-belief.\u00a0 Yet now, as he reached into his final years, he was conscious of an insecurity that he had never allowed to surface.\nHe was standing with some difficulty, exhausted, shaking with the strain of life pressing on his shoulders.\u00a0 He inched closer to inspect the painting.\u00a0 It showed a man in his prime, at the height of his physical wellbeing, he thought, yet with eyes that could not look into his own.\nHe wondered how he would be painted now?\u00a0 His physical form would show him fatter, for certain; redder of face, definitely; balding, of course.\u00a0 But, underneath the external signs of ageing, how would the artist seek to show the inner self?\u00a0 Would he portray the man of destiny, the yeoman, forever undertaking what was right and proper for God, his King and his country?\u00a0 Or would he betray the man, maltreated throughout his life, misunderstood, drenched in a guilt that he would never acknowledge, eyes unwilling to make contact with even the artist himself?\nBirley shuddered at an image that he no longer recognised.\u00a0 His shaking grew in intensity \u2026 He still had the knife in his hand.\u00a0 \u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said, \u201cI should lance the boil of history.\u2019\nIt is ironic that deep beneath St Peter\u2019s Square in the heart of Manchester lies the Birley family crypt. \u00a0Burrow beneath the streets where St Peter\u2019s Church once stood and you will find the tombs where Hugh Hornby Birley was buried on 8 August 1845, just eight days before the 26th anniversary of Peterloo. \u00a0By that time, it is doubtful that anyone congregated outside his mill or home, but the ghosts of St Peter\u2019s Field could jeer at his corpse for an eternity.\u2019\nJeff Kaye is the author of the forthcoming novel, All the People.\u00a0 It is a story of the fight for survival by Manchester people between the Reform Act of 1832 and the Plug Plot Riots of 1842, due for publication in the autumn of 2019.\u00a0 During the last 15 years, Jeff\u2019s work within international Non-Government Organisation\u2019s such as Global Witness and Transparency International added greatly to his interest in Britain\u2019s development.\u00a0 All the People is the outcome. \u00a0He previously wrote Last Line of\u00a0Defense\u00a0about corruption in America, following his earlier career in hi-tech industries.\u00a0 Jeff

Peterloo and Protest opening on Saturday 23 March. \u00a0The Fabric of Protest group will be working on this theme throughout the year, but with such a big subject, where did we begin?\nIn one of the first sessions of 2019 we started with a fabulous if not heart breaking Living History performance from PHM\u2019s Learning Programme, Peterloo, that took place in the museum galleries.\u00a0 We learnt about the different accounts of Peterloo from witnesses. \u00a0Did the masses provoke violence? \u00a0Did the yeomanry plan to charge? \u00a0Who was to blame?\nBack in the studio we talked about things that resonated with us and the power of inequality. \u00a0We recalled the Hillsborough disaster, talked about poverty, how that looks today and how it is still punished.\nIn groups and individually, participants began to make patches of fabric illustrating thoughts and ideas from Peterloo.\u00a0 These patches will be forming a larger textile mind map of our explorations of Peterloo over the next year. \u00a0We hope people can see this and add to the map throughout the year, so watch this space!\nThis month, The Fabric of Protest workshop was in the same week as International Women\u2019s Day, so we looked at the involvement of women at Peterloo.\nWomen were significant at Peterloo in a number of ways. \u00a0Female Reform Societies were springing up all over the north of England, and in towns around Manchester. Women were organising themselves politically to support the call for suffrage for the men in their lives.\nIn a meeting of Blackburn female reformers, satirised by British caricaturist George Cruickshank in a print on display at PHM, women presented the men with a handmade liberty cap, a symbol of resistance and a call to action.\nWomen were present in great numbers on the day of the Peterloo Massacre, bringing with them their children, all dressed in their best with many women dressed in white. \u00a0As the violence broke out, women were disproportionally injured by the cavalry. \u00a0Margaret Downes, Mary Heyes and Martha Partington are all included in the list of those who lost their lives at Peterloo.\nThere is a beautiful mural commissioned by PHM, on the exterior canal side wall of the museum, which features a woman and child. \u00a0Whilst the image stands as a symbol of the women who were present and involved at Peterloo, the woman in the image is the Mancunian daughter of a Windrush victim, an acknowledgement of the injustices still happening today.\nContinuing our work on the mind map collage, we discussed women at the time of Peterloo, focussing on the conditions of these working women at this time. \u00a0One participant brought in a map of where her ancestor, Martha, had lived her whole life, up and down Barrack Street in Manchester. \u00a0She talked of the space that Martha occupied; the small and cramped living conditions.\u00a0 Our youngest participant being shocked by the idea of 15 families sharing a toilet.\nThe mind map is growing, ideas flowing as the conversations weave in and out of the studio. \u00a0I love the rumination that happens in between sessions, when we come together and talk about what thoughts have been stirred by the previous month\u2019s session.\nAnd in the words of some of our participants:\n\u2018You don\u2019t need craft skills as you\u2019re provided with help, support and encouragement to help find your own style \u2013 you just need enthusiasm and an idea you want to realise!\u2019\n\u2018There is information gathering and sharing, creative activities and putting new skills into practice.\u00a0 I always leave feeling that I have achieved something.\u2019\n\u2018I find the collective interesting and informative, creative and constructive, inspiring and instructive, and above all friendly and fun.\u2019\nIn the next workshop on Saturday 13 April (1.00pm \u2013 3.30pm) we hope to be able to reach out to more members of the public, to help us grow our mind map further, gathering insights and ideas from people coming to see the Disrupt? Peterloo and Protest exhibition. \u00a0Come along, learn new techniques and share ideas of protest over a cup of tea.\u2019\n\nVisit PHM\u2019s website to book onto a Fabric of Protest workshop, held monthly on Saturdays. \u00a0Participants can attend individual workshops or join us on a more regular basis to shape how the work develops.\nKeep up to date with The Fabric of protest workshops on this blog written by Helen.\n"}, {"link": "https://phm.org.uk/blogposts/the-women-of-peterloo/", "category": "", "title": "The women of Peterloo", "author": "", "timestamp": null, "text": "\nTo celebrate International Women\u2019s Day, we\u2019ve invited our former colleague and the National Trust\u2019s new Programme Curator of National Public Programmes Helen Antrobus to blog for us.\nHelen is a specialist in the history and collections relating to 20th century radical women; from the women who marched at Peterloo, to the female Chartists; those involved with the women\u2019s suffrage movement, to the first female MPs, and shares with us her insight into the women at Peterloo.\n\u2018On 16 August 1819, around 60,000 people gathered in St Peter\u2019s Fields in Manchester. Henry \u2018Orator\u2019 Hunt had been invited to speak at a meeting to challenge the Anti-Corn Laws, which kept the price of wheat artificially high, and to advocate parliamentary reform. Manchester, which had boomed during the Industrial Revolution, did not have its own Member of Parliament (MP), and therefore the cotton and textile workers who dominated the city were not being politically represented.\nThe reformers were demanding the vote for men, pre-empting Chartist action that would come about 20 years later. Although votes for women were not included in reformers\u2019 demands, roughly one in eight of those at St Peter\u2019s Fields that day were women.\u00a0 In their best clothes and bringing their families with them, with their children in their arms.\u00a0 Later, in the court testaments, some of the women argued that they knew it would not be a riot, simply because they felt safe enough bringing their children along.\nThe meeting ended as a massacre.\u00a0 Around 18 people died, and hundreds of people were injured as the yeomanry charged the crowds, who fled the field, crushing each other to escape the sabres of the volunteer militia.\u00a0 Included in the list of dead were Margaret Downes, Mary Heyes, and Martha Partington.\nThe women who attended St Peter\u2019s Fields that day were not only on the ground, but standing on the speakers\u2019 platform alongside the men.\u00a0 Mary Fildes, the president of the Manchester Female Reform Society (and\u00a0PHM Radical), can be seen in depictions of the day, holding a banner with the cap of liberty on the pole.\nThe Peterloo Massacre was not the first instance of women being politically engaged. In 1784, the Duchess of Devonshire Georgiana Cavendish campaigned for Charles Fox to win the general election, for the Whig party over the Tories.\u00a0 She wore a fox tail in her hat, and spoke next to him at rallies which resulted in rumours that she was buying votes for kisses.\nIn 1792, Mary Wollstonecraft\u2019s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman was published, and though it argued for educational advancement for women, Wollstonecraft was strongly criticised for her views. Both she and her partner William Godwin disagreed with marriage, and she subsequently had two children outside of wedlock by two different men.\u00a0 This was frowned upon, and fed into the idea that political women usurped traditional gender roles, and distracted women from their children and caring for their families.\nFour days before the Peterloo Massacre, a cartoon entitled The Belle-alliance, or the female reformers of Blackburn!! was published, depicting the Blackburn Female Reform Society speaking at an open air meeting.\u00a0 Despite the women being well organised and sober, the cartoon depicts them as bawdy, licentious, and ugly women; their children lay abandoned, their clothes are dishevelled, and the drawing is peppered with sexual innuendo, implying that women who got involved with politics were merely looking for sexual favours.\nThe argument of the Female Reform Societies, however, was sound.\u00a0 Though they did not demand the vote for themselves, they recognised the impact of having a household member \u2013 their husbands and fathers \u2013 being able to vote would make a massive difference on matters such as income, wages, and working conditions.\nLike many of the women who attended that day, Mary Fildes wore her best clothes.\u00a0 When the yeomanry attacked, Mary attempted to escape, but was caught when her dress caught on a nail on the speakers\u2019 platform.\u00a0 Mary was attacked by the yeomanry, but survived.\u00a0 Another woman, Elizabeth Gaunt, was found in Henry Hunt\u2019s carriage, perhaps shielding herself from attack. She, alongside Hunt, was put on trial for treason.\nThe dresses of the women at Peterloo, as Mary\u2019s experience highlights, were both emotionally and physically restricting; not only did they delay escape, but they marked out political women, the usurpers of society, for attack.\u00a0 One of the few surviving objects from that day at St Peter\u2019s Field is a dress worn by a Mrs Mabbott \u2013 a shopkeeper who resided on Bridge Street in the city centre of Manchester.\u00a0 The dress is constricting; it doesn\u2019t allow for much movement, and demonstrates how difficult it would have been for women to flee that day.\u00a0 \u00a0Although there were less women present at Peterloo in comparison to the number of men, when examining the figures, it is clear that a high percentage of women were attacked and injured; whether through convenience, or design.\nWhat is clear is the immense bravery of the women who marched to St Peter\u2019s Field that day.\u00a0 Not only did they risk the wrath of the magistrates and the law-makers, but they risked anger amongst their own ranks as well. To be a political woman took courage, and the women of Peterloo would go on to champion Chartism, the abolition of slavery, and eventually, women\u2019s suffrage.\u00a0 At each step, they would face more backlash and outcry; even when their dresses were less restrictive, and their voices grew louder, women were kept out of parliament, fighting to get in. It is incredible to think that it took another 109 years of persistence and perseverance for the true meaning of universal suffrage \u2013 a demand carried on banners at Peterloo \u2013 to be achieved.\nIt is no surprise, then, that almost a century later, a suffragette stood at a husting in the centre of Manchester, and addressed the crowds of men and women as such:\n\u2018We helped you carry your banners at Peterloo. Now it is your turn to help us carry ours.\u2019\u2019\nMrs Mabbott\u2019s dress, on loan from Manchester Art Gallery, will be on display in the Disrupt? Peterloo and Protest exhibition at PHM from Saturday 23 March 2019 until Sunday 23 February 2020 as part of PHM\u2019s year long programme exploring the past, present and future of protest, marking 200 years since the Peterloo Massacre; a major event in Manchester\u2019s history, and a defining moment for Britain\u2019s democracy.\u00a0\u00a0The exhibition Disrupt? Peterloo and Protest is supported by The National Lottery Heritage Fund.\n"}, {"link": "https://phm.org.uk/blogposts/from-paul-weller-to-peterloo/", "category": "", "title": "From Paul Weller to Peterloo", "author": "", "timestamp": "2019-03-01 00:00:00", "text": "To complement the display of a first edition of Percy Bysshe Shelley\u2019s The Masque of Anarchy from Friday 1 March until\u00a0the end of April 2019, we invited Dr Michael Sanders, Senior Lecturer in 19th century writing at the University of Manchester to share his insight into Shelley\u2019s protest poem.\nIn his blog Michael reveals his first encounter with the poem on a record sleeve:\n\u2018Rise like lions after slumber\nIn unvanquishable NUMBER!\nShake your chains to earth, like dew\nWhich in sleep had fall\u2019n on you:\nYE ARE MANY \u2014 THEY ARE FEW. \u2014\u2019\nLines 151 to 155 from The Masque of Anarchy by Percy Bysshe Shelley.\n\u2018The closing stanza of Shelley\u2019s The Masque of Anarchy are amongst the most famous lines of political poetry ever penned by an Englishman abroad.\u00a0 In 2017 they featured prominently in the Labour Party\u2019s general election campaign, being quoted frequently by the leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn, as well as inspiring the title of the party\u2019s 2017 manifesto, For the Many, Not the Few.\u00a0 In quoting Shelley\u2019s words, Corbyn was continuing a tradition which is now almost 200 years old.\u00a0 Ever since their publication in 1832, Shelley\u2019s words have been cherished by the left; from the Chartist movement of the 1840s through the socialist pioneers of the 1880s and 1890s and beyond, Shelley\u2019s call to resistance has echoed down the decades.\nHowever, my first encounter with these lines was not on a demonstration or in a political meeting but in a record shop.\u00a0 I first read them, in 1980, on the back sleeve of The Jam\u2019s newly released Sound Affects album.\u00a0 In fact, the album quoted 13 lines from the poem, giving stanzas 73 and 82 in addition to its final verse.\u00a0 Although the album cover attributed these lines to \u2018Shelley\u2019, it didn\u2019t say where they came from.\u00a0 At that time the only Shelley I had heard of was Pete Shelley (of English punk rock band Buzzcocks fame) and I didn\u2019t think this was quite in his style.\u00a0 So a few days after purchasing the album, I headed off to a secondhand bookshop, found a cheap edition of Shelley\u2019s Selected Works and finally found that the lines were taken from The Masque of Anarchy.\u00a0 My teenage self reckoned that if The Jam\u2019s Paul Weller (and PHM Radical) rated this guy Shelley then it was probably worth reading the whole poem.\u00a0 So began a lifetime\u2019s interest in English radical poetry.\n\nThe Masque of Anarchy was written in response to the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester on 16 August 1819.\u00a0 Percy and Mary Shelley were living in Italy when news of the events in Manchester reached them and Mary later recalled \u2018when the news of the Manchester Massacre reached us; it roused in [Shelley] violent emotions of indignation and compassion\u2026Inspired by these feelings, he wrote The Masque of Anarchy\u2019 (Note on The Mask of Anarchy, by Mrs Shelley, 1839).\u00a0 On completing the poem, Shelley sent it to his friend Leigh Hunt, editor of The Examiner, for publication.\u00a0 Leigh Hunt decided against publishing the poem, later claiming he \u2018thought that the public at large had not become sufficiently discerning to do justice to the sincerity and kind-heartedness of the spirit that walked in this flaming robe of verse\u2019 (Preface to The Masque of Anarchy, 1832).\nIt is possible that in the atmosphere of intensified political repression following Peterloo, Leigh Hunt was reluctant to risk a further period of imprisonment (he had already served two years in jail for criticising the Prince Regent in The Examiner).\u00a0 Thus, the poem never appeared in print during Shelley\u2019s lifetime.\u00a0 Indeed, it was first published in 1832, ten years after his death, by Edward Moxon with a preface by Leigh Hunt.\u00a0 A copy of a first edition of the poem has been purchased by the Working Class Movement Library (WCML) thanks to funding from The National Lottery Heritage Fund Collecting Cultures programme, and will be displayed at both WCML and PHM as part of the Peterloo bicentenary commemorations.\nIt is appropriate that this volume will be on display first at People\u2019s History Museum because Shelley wrote this, consciously and deliberately, for the people.\u00a0 For The Masque of Anarchy Shelley adopts the popular form of a broadside ballad.\u00a0 He uses a direct, forceful style which is very different from his more abstract, philosophical musings of poems such as Mont Blanc or Hymn to Intellectual Beauty.\u00a0 Shelley\u2019s anger at and contempt for the government which had presided over Peterloo is unmistakable; his image of the Prime Minister, Lord Castlereagh, \u2018toss[ing] human hearts\u2019 to his \u2018blood-hounds\u2019 is as savage and visually arresting as any cartoon by Steve Bell or Martin Rowson.\u00a0 Just like these present day cartoonists, Shelley\u2019s intention is to get his readers to see what is really happening.\u00a0 In this instance, that those same politicians who proclaim their obedience to the law and the constitution are in reality the agents of anarchy.\u00a0 How else, Shelley asks, could you describe the murder of unarmed, peaceful demonstrators at St Peter\u2019s Field?\nBut The Masque of Anarchy does more than simply record Shelley\u2019s anger.\u00a0 It also looks to redeem the suffering inflicted on the people at Peterloo.\u00a0 The poem does this in two ways; it turns Peterloo into a prophetic sacrifice which brings about a new social order, and it also imagines a second Peterloo which ends with the victory of the people.\u00a0 Shelley insists that only freedom, not revenge, can atone for the blood spilt at Peterloo.\u00a0 And the freedom he depicts starts with the material, bread and butter freedom that comes only when labour receives its proper reward:\n\u2018For the labourer thou art bread,\nAnd a comely table spread\nFrom his daily labour come\nIn a neat and happy home.\nThou art clothes, and fire, and food,\u2019 (lines 217 to 221).\nIn the verses which follow Shelley identifies, \u2018Justice\u2026Wisdom\u2026Peace\u2026[and] Love\u2019 (lines 230 to 246), as the key attributes of freedom.\nHowever, in order to secure these blessings, the people will once again have to resist oppression as they did at Peterloo.\u00a0 The poem\u2019s final third begins \u2018Let a great Assembly be / Of the fearless and the free\u2019 (lines 262 and 263).\u00a0 Shelley then calls on that same Assembly to \u2018Declare with measured words that ye / Are, as God has made ye, free\u2019 (lines 297 and 298).\u00a0 This is Peterloo reimagined: a gathering of the people to assert their political rights.\u00a0 Shelley is under no illusion how the powerful will respond to such a demonstration.\u00a0 He warns that the \u2018tyrants\u2019 will, once again, use violence \u2013 the \u2018fixed bayonet\u2019 will again draw \u2018blood\u2019, and \u2018the horsemen\u2019s scimitars\u2019 will \u2018Wheel and flash\u2019 (lines 311 to 316).\u00a0 In the face of such aggression, Shelley advocates non-violent resistance:\n\u2018Stand ye calm and resolute,\nLike a forest close and mute,\nWith folded arms and looks which are\nWeapons of unvanquished war\u2019 (lines 319 to 322).\nShelley prophesises that the aggressors will lose all moral authority, \u2018they will return with shame / To the place from which they came\u2019 (lines 348 and 349) and with their departure in disgrace the stage of history is set for those triumphant closing lines which, as Shelley himself predicts, will be \u2018Heard again \u2014 again \u2014 again \u2014\u2019:\n\u2018Rise like lions after slumber\nIn unvanquishable NUMBER!\nShake your chains to earth, like dew\nWhich in sleep had fall\u2019n on you:\nYE ARE MANY \u2014 THEY ARE FEW. \u2014\u2019\nDr Michael Sanders is currently working on the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) funded research project,

Museum (PHM).\u00a0 During his time with us, he has written the first draft of a play called First Rumours.\u00a0 The play is about seasoned human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell\u2019s time as a Labour Party candidate in the hugely controversial 1983 Bermondsey by-election.\nFirst Rumours, was given a first rehearsed reading at People\u2019s History Museum on Sunday 10 February 2019 followed by a Q&A with Peter Tatchell, chaired by LGBT activist and historian Paul Fairweather.\u00a0 In his final blog for us, Stephen reflects on the experience of having Peter Tatchell attend the rehearsed reading of the play.\n\u2018I\u2019m trying to be sensitive.\u00a0 Peter Tatchell has just arrived at the People\u2019s History Museum and I\u2019m ushering him through the crowd into the performance area.\u00a0 It\u2019s the largest part of the building, the Engine Hall.\u00a0 The cavernous space seems to make the occasion all the more daunting.\u00a0 Peter\u2019s here to see a rehearsed reading of a play I have written, First Rumours.\u00a0 With him as the lead character.\u00a0 He\u2019s not seen even one scene of it in advance.\u00a0 And he\u2019s about to hear it read in front of over 100 members of the public, many of whom I suspect will be watching him watching it.\u00a0 \u2018Where would you like to sit?\u2019 I ask, as if a seating plan is the solution to the nervousness I suddenly feel.\u00a0 Peter chooses a seat on the end of a row, towards the back.\u00a0 I nod to the museum\u2019s Visitor Services Assistants, the door opens.\u00a0 I hide at the rear of the room and prepare myself for Peter\u2019s response.\nI almost forget that I\u2019m introducing the reading.\u00a0 I do forget to prepare anything.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s just straight up and improvise.\u00a0 I hope I\u2019ve name checked the placement partners correctly; the Arts and Humanities Research Council, the People\u2019s History Museum and the University of Salford.\u00a0 I go to sit down.\u00a0 At the very rear of the room next to the director, the wonderful Matt Hassall.\u00a0 There\u2019s isn\u2019t a free seat.\u00a0 I stand.\u00a0 Should I have done thank yous to more people?\u00a0 Oh well, it\u2019s too late now.\nThe reading starts.\nI\u2019ve taken some real liberties with the facts.\u00a0 One of the people standing against Peter in the Bermondsey by-election was the Dowager Lady Birdwood, a rightwing extremist.\u00a0 Much as I abhor her politics, the Dowager Lady has fascinated me throughout the script development process and I wanted to work her into the script to provide contrast and comedy.\u00a0 I\u2019ve moulded her into Peter\u2019s nemesis and created some fantasy sequences when she is confronting him about not being out as a gay man to the media.\u00a0 Suddenly, with Peter sat there, this feels like a real intrusion.\u00a0 The fabulous Judy Holt is giving a wonderful performance, relishing lines like, \u2018Ask the lefties to line up and form a firing squad, and do you know what they do?\u00a0 Form a circle!\u00a0 Form a bloody circle\u2019.\u00a0 The audience is laughing at least, even if Peter isn\u2019t.\nI\u2019ve taken other liberties as well.\u00a0 Two different Chairs of the Bermondsey constituency Labour Party have been conflated into one character.\u00a0 I\u2019ve cut up bits of Peter\u2019s articles and turned them into political speeches, re-writing and re-positioning his words to suit the drama of my script.\u00a0 I\u2019ve dramatised the homophobic verbal and physical abuse that Peter has suffered into a stylised scene that Peter, who still suffers with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of this abuse, is now sitting through.\u00a0 I\u2019ve re-ordered some events and I\u2019ve created something of a comedy caricature of Simon Hughes, the Liberal Party candidate who stood against Peter.\u00a0 Every choice feels alarmingly like the wrong one.\nAnd then there are the scenes we\u2019ve left out.\u00a0 Have we made the wrong choices in cutting them?\u00a0 There was a long scene where Peter and Michael Foot, then Labour Party leader, debated the nature of extra-parliamentary action using text taken from letters sent to Foot by members of the public at the time.\u00a0 Losing that scene stops those voices in the PHM archive from being heard, and maybe the scene provided necessary political context that we\u2019ve now lost?\u00a0 The play ends on a monologue by Peter partly drawn from an article he wrote for London Labour Briefing and partly an invented coming out speech to the press.\u00a0 The original ending was a fantasy alternative where Peter was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) and uses his maiden speech in the House of Commons to come out.\u00a0 Was that the better ending?\nAnd suddenly, it\u2019s over.\u00a0 And people are clapping.\u00a0 And whooping.\u00a0 And clapping some more.\u00a0 The cast take a bow.\u00a0 More clapping.\u00a0 The audience liked it.\u00a0 Now I have to take to the stage with Peter and a Q&A starts, chaired by activist and LGBT historian Paul Fairweather.\u00a0 I still can\u2019t quite tell what Peter\u2019s response is.\u00a0 The questions start.\u00a0 I hear him talk about how weird the whole experience of watching my Peter Tatchell was, and then he starts laughing and smiling and he\u2019s talking about how accurate it all was.\u00a0 And, finally, I can smile too.\nNow, what if I turned the whole thing into a musical?\u2019\n\nFirst Rumours, was given a first rehearsed reading at People\u2019s History Museum on Sunday 10 February 2019 as part of OUTing the Past, the national festival of LGBT history, and the museum\u2019s 2019 programme exploring the past, present and future of protest.\u00a0 Stephen\u2019s work began with a detailed study of the Labour Party archives, the complete holdings of which are held at PHM, which also holds some of the personal papers of Peter Tatchell.\u00a0 The project was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and the University of Salford.\nStephen has a full-length play called The Adhesion of Love on tour until the end of May 2019.\u00a0 The play tells the extraordinary true story of how a working class architect\u2019s assistant from Bolton crossed the Atlantic in 1891 to meet visionary queer American poet, Walt Whitman.\nYou can find out more

handouts, and discussions, using PHM\u2019s collections.\nIs it contagious? \u00a0Germs, disease, influenza and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)\nThe remains of 20,000 people lie buried under the grounds of St John\u2019s Church located just a few hundred yards from the museum.\u00a0 All died after being struck down by the plague that spread throughout Europe in the 14th century.\u00a0 A third of the population in England was killed from what we now know was the lethal bacteria, Yersinia pestis, spread by rodents such as rats.\u00a0 Some people carried garlic and onions hoping for protection.\u00a0 There was none.\nOne hundred years ago it was a different germ that spread across the world killing people.\u00a0 More were killed by germs than were killed by all the bullets and bombs in the battles of World War I.\u00a0 Influenza, or Spanish Flu as it was called, killed between 50 and 100 million people; two thirds in a single ten week period in the autumn of 1918.\u00a0 To halt the spread of the killer disease a mask was worn to cover the mouth.\u00a0 This mask offered no protection at all, we now know, the virus responsible is spread by breathing in infected particles that enter the body through the skin inside the nose.\nOver two centuries there have been massive advancements in science, medicine, and in public health that have led to a greater understanding of health and the eradication of many once lethal and contagious diseases.\u00a0 Penicillin, immunisation, antibiotics have saved and transformed millions of lives.\u00a0 However, the over use and reliance on antibiotics has now led to the evolution of strains that are resistant to drugs.\u00a0 Some epidemiologists warn of a new strain of killer virus that could spread once more across the world.\nThe course includes a visit to PHM\u2019s Labour History Archive & Study Centre to examine photographs of housing conditions, and original documents regarding the establishment of the NHS.\n\nWater safe to drink? \u00a0Cholera, sewage, plumbing and water today\nIn Salford and Manchester in the 1840s people lived in overcrowded back to back tenements.\u00a0 Hundreds shared a single toilet.\u00a0 The sewage flowed down the middle of the street and cholera and other diseases spread rapidly.\nThe job of the Night Soil Man was to collect human waste and take it in barrels to Davyhulme Sewage Works, a village just outside of Manchester.\u00a0 It was the main waste water treatment works for the city, and one of the largest in Europe.\nThe night soil was spread on the bare land and the sun\u2019s rays would eventually break down the waste at the sewage farm.\u00a0 This process was improved on and then replaced with development of filtration beds.\nA new activated sludge process for sewage treatment was developed at the Davyhulme Sewage Works in 1913.\u00a0 It is now the standard method used in sewage works across the world.\u00a0 Today thermal hydrolysis is the latest technology used at the plant. \u00a0Separated waste solids are put in a huge pressure cooker; heat exchange produces methane used as fuel to make the electricity that runs the entire plant; the residue is a \u2018cake\u2019 that is given to farmers to spread on fields to improve fertility and soil structure.\u00a0 This new plant can be seen by car if you drive over the M60 Barton Bridge.\nDuring the course a visiting speaker from the Davyhulme Sewage Works will explore this development.\nTake a deep breath? \u00a0Cars, seatbelts, air pollution and fossil fuels\nMotor vehicle accidents used to be the most common cause of death for men and for women in the 15 to 40 years\u2019 age group.\u00a0 Cars used to kill more people than cancer.\nIn 1966 the American political activist Ralph Nader wrote his book, Unsafe at Any Speed which revealed that the US car manufacturers had developed adaptations that they knew would make their cars safer \u2013 but they did not install these life saving measures. \u00a0Car sales were promoted through advertising a fast and sexy image and safety from being killed did not fit that image. \u00a0After Nader spoke out the campaign for safer cars grew, the manufacturers were forced to make changes, cars were made much safer. \u00a0With the introduction of safe glass windshields, seat belts, air bags, and then legislation for manufacturers, drivers and passengers, today\u2019s cars have never been safer.\nBut invisible, toxic emissions from cars, lorries and busses are at record and dangerous levels. \u00a0Today toxic exhaust fumes kill people, children\u2019s lung development is stunted, and asthma is becoming more common. \u00a0Some of the highest concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) have been measured in inner city Manchester.\nAlong with great advancements in public health, we are today seeing a return of health problems that once were thought to have been solved.\u2019\nThe course

00:00:00", "text": "PHM\u2019s 2019 banner display has been carefully curated to reflect key moments of protest in Greater Manchester and across Britain, representing a mix of creatively disobedient ideas and actions along the road to democratic reform, from the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester in 1819 to today.\nWe asked historian Peter Morgan, who\u2019s also head writer for our friends at The Radical Tea Towel Company, to review our new display of banners.\n\u2018When our calendars reach 16 August this year, it will be 200 years to the day that the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry \u2013 \u2018the local business mafia on horseback\u2019[1] \u2013 began the Peterloo Massacre.\nSabres drawn, they charged the gathering crowd of 60,000, unarmed, and working class people on St Peter\u2019s Field in Manchester (now the area around St Peter\u2019s Square) as they met peacefully to call for the right to vote, for freedom from oppression and for justice.\nBut the yeomanry\u2019s rampage, quickly joined by regular units like the 15th Hussars, was not wholly aimless. \u00a0They were after the banners which had been brought to the meeting.\u00a0 The only surviving banner belonged to Thomas Redford, a Peterloo participant from Middleton.\u00a0 The banner reads \u2018Liberty and Fraternity\u2019 on one side, and \u2018Unity and Strength\u2019 on the other.\nInscribed with these kind of rhetorical traces from the French Revolution and other such sources, the banners held on St Peter\u2019s Field in 1819 embodied the bold, democratic radicalism of that gathering in a material form.\u00a0 This is why they were targeted.\u00a0 The \u2018younger members of the Tory party in arms\u2019[2] who made up the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry wanted to steal these banners so as to rip the symbolic heart out of their working class enemy.\nThis theft and destruction of the radical banners at Peterloo, then, is proof of how important they have been as tools of protest and dissent in British history. And while Thomas Redford\u2019s is not part of the new display of banners at the People\u2019s History Museum (PHM) the cultural spirit of Peterloo animates the entire display. \u00a0As the curator, PHM Programme Officer Michael Powell, assured me, the new display\u2019s organising themes of youth, Greater Manchester, and the creativity of civil disobedience all have a base in the experience of Peterloo.\nMy own engagement with the cultural field of our radical past has mainly been with its literature \u2013 historical monographs like E P Thompson\u2019s The Making of the English Working Class, pamphlets such as Tom Paine\u2019s Common Sense, diaries like those of the late Tony Benn etc (PHM\u2019s Labour History Archive & Study Centre contains correspondence of both Tony Benn\u2019s and E P Thompson\u2019s on a variety of subjects). \u00a0And, like many focused on the literary, I have come to suffer from the philistine prejudice that literature is somehow more complex than other forms of expression.\nFor me, the new display of historic and contemporary banners at the PHM has forced some important steps away from this narrow-mindedness \u2013 no assumption that banners, as primarily visual objects, provide something relatively straightforward can outlast a tour through this display.\nFrom the first to the last (there are 26 in total), a close viewing of these expertly conserved banners, aided by the contexts provided, makes clear the sheer range of functions which banners can perform and the sophistication with which they have been made to perform them. \u00a0Take, for example, two of the banners toward the end of Main Gallery Two, made in the 1890s by different branches of the Dockers\u2019 Union formed in the wake of the Great London Dock Strike of 1889 (for which the famous socialist hymn, The Red Flag, was written).\n\n\nBoth stunning works of design, the one made by the Ipswich Branch shows on one side two labourers perched on barrels of trade goods in a dockyard with a merchant ship sailing in out of the distance, to emphasise the value of the dockers\u2019 work to Britain\u2019s commercial wealth. On the reverse of the banner stands a docker and his employer shaking hands, with an angel above them holding the words, \u2018MAY THEY EVER BE UNITED\u2019.\n\nIn stark contrast, hanging nearby, is the banner made by the Dockers\u2019 Union Export Branch of the same union. \u00a0Centred here is not an image of harmony, but one of bitter conflict \u2013 a depiction of Hercules grappling with a serpent and framed by the slogans, \u2018WE WILL FIGHT AND MAY DIE BUT WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER\u2019 to its right, and \u2018THIS IS A HOLY WAR AND WE SHALL NOT CEASE UNTIL ALL DESTITUTION, PROSTITUTION & EXPLOITATION IS SWEPT AWAY\u2019 beneath it.\nThe difference between these two Dockers\u2019 Union banners wasn\u2019t, I\u2019d wager, a matter of aesthetic preference, but one of political philosophy. \u00a0The Ipswich Branch design holds up the ideal of harmony between employers and employees (\u2018may they ever be united\u2019) and promotes negotiation and agreement as the means to realise it (with the handshake). \u00a0The Export Branch banner, on the other hand, presents industrial relations as a (literally) Herculean struggle of labour against exploitation \u2013 a \u2018Holy War\u2019 in which the dockers \u2018will fight\u2019 and \u2018may die\u2019. \u00a0The road to success being advocated here was not negotiation, (the serpent that Hercules is wrestling has no hand to shake) but battle i.e. the strike.\nPhysically juxtaposed with each other by the display, these two trade union banners make us consider how they were not mere \u2018decorations\u2019 but also arguments being made \u2013 through a genius combination of image and word \u2013 by workers on either side of the late 19th century debate about methods in the British labour movement.\nA tribute to and from Peterloo\nThis quick reflection on the dockers doesn\u2019t exhaust the variety of radical functions which the new display shows banners performing over the decades. \u00a0Far from it. \u00a0For example, the banner in the middle of Main Gallery One made by Russian textile workers and dedicated to the textile workers of Yorkshire in the 1920s can be seen as a type of \u2018diplomatic communique\u2019, in an attempt to build up working class support in the West at a time when the young Soviet Union faced civil war and foreign invasion. \u00a0Michael Powell also raised the notion that outside of the final product, the collective process of making a banner can also serve as a forum for valuable political discussion and development among those who would later march under it.\nFor me, then, the unlimited-ness of what a banner can do for radical politics is a central and valuable takeaway from PHM\u2019s 2019 Banner Display. \u00a0In its political sophistication as well as its artistic beauty, this new display of banners at PHM is a really well made testament to the often under-appreciated \u2013 not least by me(!) \u2013 genius of banners as objects of progressive thought and expression.\nThese banners, displaying the creativity-in-communication which has defined Britain\u2019s modern radical tradition, make for a fitting tribute to Peterloo at the beginning of its bicentenary. \u00a0They also, in a way, together add up to Peterloo\u2019s tribute to us. \u00a0As Michael told me, many of the practices of protest which these banners incorporate were inaugurated by the activists at Peterloo in 1819 \u2013 not least the tactic of marching and carrying banners itself, best seen in his personal favourite, the 1983 Peoples March for Jobs banner.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Thomas Redford\u2019s \u2018Liberty and Fraternity\u2019 banner (at Touchstones, Rochdale) that survives 1819, then \u2013 each of the 26 banners on display at People\u2019s History Museum, from those made in the 1890s to the \u2018Nothing About Us Without Us\u2019 disability rights banner made in 2015, is in a way part of our inheritance from Peterloo.\u2019\n[1] Krantz, Mark (2011),\u00a0Rise\u00a0Like Lions: The History and Lessons of the Peterloo Massacre of 1819\u00a0(page 12)\n[2] Wainwright, Martin (13 August 2007),\u00a0Battle for

new play, First Rumours, for us.\u00a0 It\u2019s about seasoned human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell\u2019s time as a Labour Party candidate in the hugely controversial 1983 Bermondsey by-election.\nFirst Rumours is given a first rehearsed reading at PHM on Sunday 10 February 2019 at 3.00pm. \u00a0The reading will be followed by a Q&A with Peter Tatchell, facilitated by LGBT activist and historian Paul Fairweather. \u00a0Booking essential.\nStephen undertook several lengthy interviews with Peter to write the play and this second blog is about a moment where it went a little wrong in the first of those interviews.\n\u2018It\u2019s a rainy Sunday afternoon in October 2018.\u00a0 The kind of day when even the midday light is a grey puddle and any Harry Potter movie and the sofa beckon.\u00a0 Instead, I\u2019ve gone to London to do my first interview with Peter Tatchell.\u00a0 I write history plays, often about queer men, usually dead queer men who have been forgotten, or cast as asexual or even wilfully straight-washed.\nGiven that Peter is very much alive and kicking, it seems daft not to take the opportunity to speak to him.\u00a0 He is so busy that it\u2019s taken about a year to get some slots in his diary, and even then those are Sunday afternoons, when most people would be resting\u2026 perhaps watching Harry Potter movies on their sofa.\nPeter isn\u2019t.\u00a0 He\u2019s been up since 6.00am giving scores of media interviews about the Supreme Court ruling unanimously in favour of the right of some bakers in Northern Ireland not to make a cake with a pro-equal marriage slogan on it.\u00a0 Peter supports their right not to make the cake, which is controversial but consistent with his principles.\u00a0 It\u2019s also generated a heap of interview requests.\u00a0 It would be fair to say he\u2019s already been interview blasted by the time I arrive, and he\u2019s got three hours more of it with me.\nI used to interview people for a living.\u00a0 Not as a journalist, but as a Probation Officer.\u00a0 My training was always to build rapport with the person you were interviewing and to be nosey about their background.\u00a0 I realise this has probably formed a subconscious template for my interview with Peter as he suddenly detaches from answering my questions, bristles and says, \u2018I\u2019m just conscious, we haven\u2019t got to Bermondsey yet and it\u2019s getting on for half past three.\u2019\u00a0 I\u2019m a bit taken aback.\u00a0 We\u2019re half way through the first of three interviews and I thought I was pacing it well.\u00a0 He softens, \u2018If you need all this, that\u2019s fine, you know.\u2019\u00a0 I\u2019m a bit thrown. \u00a0Do I need all this?\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure.\u00a0 Should I just be sticking strictly to asking questions about 1983 and Bermondsey?\nWhatever the right approach would\u2019ve been, I have got Peter talking about something I think is very important in understanding who he is in 1983, or even who he is now; his first relationship.\u00a0 Peter grew up in Melbourne, Australia in a working class family:\n\u2018My passion was art and design.\u00a0 Since my parent couldn\u2019t afford to send me to art college or university, I had to figure out a way of getting into that profession without any qualifications.\u00a0 So, I hit on the idea of working for a big department store where I could start as a junior and learn on the job.\u2019\nPeter started work for the prestigious Waltons department store just as he turned 17, learning signwriting, interior design and display.\u00a0 His career blossomed.\u00a0 But Walton\u2019s did more than provide a positive practical environment for Peter to express his considerable creative talent.\u00a0 The displays team consisted of ten staff, and four of them were gay.\nPeter identifies himself as straight at this point.\u00a0 He had had girlfriends at school, but had never slept with any of them.\u00a0 Having had a conservative Christian upbringing, he had been taught that sex outside of marriage was sinful, and observed the prohibition.\u00a0 However, Peter had caught the eye of one of the team, who asked him the same thing at the end of every day for months, \u2018Are you coming home to dinner tonight?\u2019\u00a0 Then one night, Peter found himself saying yes.\nAfter a slightly heart-stopping moment when his mother spotted the two of them at the tram, Peter had sex for the first time:\n\u2018That was truly amazing sexually and emotionally.\u00a0 It felt totally normal, totally natural, totally me\u2026 I never had a moment\u2019s doubt after that first sexual experience. \u00a0I thought to myself religion has got it wrong\u2026 These proscriptions in the Bible are intended to protect people from harm, but what we\u2019d done had caused no one any harm.\u00a0 It\u2019s a mistake or a mistranslation, whatever the explanation is because quite clearly there is nothing wrong with being gay.\u2019\nWhat followed was a two-and-a-half year romantic relationship which tuned into a deep friendship that exists to this day.\u00a0 Peter\u2019s first love was a happy and positive one and this affirmative attitude to gay sex and sexuality and his own identity is what he brings with him when he emigrates to the UK in 1971.\u00a0 The experience of the Bermondsey by-election was pretty much the opposite, in every possible sense, to one he had at Waltons.\u2019\nStephen\u2019s play about Peter Tatchell, First Rumours, will be given a first rehearsed reading at People\u2019s History Museum on Sunday 10 February 2019 at 3.00pm as part of OUTing the Past, the national festival of LGBT history, and the museum\u2019s 2019 programme exploring the past, present and future of protest. \u00a0The reading will be followed by a Q&A with Peter Tatchell, facilitated by LGBT activist and historian Paul Fairweather.\u00a0 Booking essential.\nStephen\u2019s work began with a detailed study of the Labour Party archives, the complete holdings of which are held at PHM, which also holds some of the personal papers of Peter Tatchell. The project is supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and the University of Salford.\n\nYou can find out more about Stephen\u2019s other work here:\nTwitter:

"timestamp": "2018-12-18 00:00:00", "text": "To complement the public display of a suffragette tea set designed by Sylvia Pankhurst we asked Dr Alexandra Hughes-Johnson,\u00a0suffrage historian and Women in the Humanities Research Co-ordinator at the University of Oxford, for the story of its former owner, suffragette Rose Lamartine Yates (1875-1954).\nUntil recently Rose Lamartine Yates has remained a relatively unknown figure in the history of the women\u2019s suffrage movement and despite attempts by historians Elizabeth Crawford, Gillian Hawtin and Gail Cameron to shed light onto Rose\u2019s suffrage career, she is often still remembered for her friendship with the Emily Wilding Davison and her role as the first guard of honour to her coffin at Emily\u2019s funeral on the 14 June 1913.\n\nThroughout the suffrage centenary, however, interest in Rose\u2019s life and legacy has extended far beyond her friendship with Emily.\u00a0 Not only has Rose\u2019s role as the Organising Secretary of the Wimbledon Women\u2019s Social and Political Union (WSPU) been showcased in both the academic and heritage spheres, her contribution to the wartime suffrage campaign and her position as a London County Councillor and founding member of the Women\u2019s Record House has also come to the fore as a result of my doctoral research.\u00a0 Moreover, thanks to People\u2019s History Museum (PHM), Rose\u2019s story is receiving further interest as a suffragette tea set, that once belonged to Rose, is now on display at the museum until Sunday 24 February 2019 as part of their programme exploring the past, present and future of representation, marking 100 years since the passing of the Representation of the People Act (1918).\n\nThe tea set, now in PHM\u2019s collection, includes the Angel of Freedom design created by Sylvia Pankhurst. \u00a0It was in my home town of Stoke-on-Trent that the tea sets were originally made by H W Williamson of Longton. \u00a0Rose Lamartine Yates regularly held fundraising tea parties for the Wimbledon WSPU in the gardens of her home, Dorset Hall in Wimbledon and the Lamartine Yates family would have had multiple suffragette tea sets in their home during the height of the campaign for women\u2019s suffrage.\nFor more information on suffragette china please see this article by Elizabeth Crawford.\nThe early years\nRose Emma Janau was born of French parentage on 23 February 1875 at 33 Dalyell Road in Lambeth, London and was the youngest of three children.[1] \u00a0Both her parents, Elphege Bertoni Victor Janau (b 1847), a teacher of foreign languages, and Marie Pauline Janau (b 1841) were born in France but later became naturalised British citizens. \u00a0Rose was schooled at Clapham and Truro High Schools and travelled to Kassel and the Sorbonne to study at the University of Paris.[2] \u00a0In October 1896, Rose entered Royal Holloway College to study Modern Languages and Philology. \u00a0In 1899, Rose passed the Oxford Final Honours Examination (the highest examination that was open to women at the University of Oxford) however she was not awarded her degree on the grounds that she was simply a woman.[3]\nIn 1898, with the full approval of her parents, Rose began a courtship with solicitor and family friend, Thomas (Tom) Lamartine Yates. \u00a0The couple married in 1900 in Stoke d\u2019Abernon in Surrey. \u00a0During their first years of marriage, they were both passionate cyclists who toured throughout Europe with the Cyclist\u2019s Touring Club (CTC).[4] \u00a0Rose became a leading figure within the reform party, becoming the first female member to be elected to the CTC\u2019s council in 1907. \u00a0It was during this time, when Rose stood for election to the CTC\u2019s council, that she made the statement that she \u2018was not a suffragette\u2019.[5] Nevertheless, just a year later, Rose wrote that although it was \u2018an honest statement\u2019 it was at the same time \u2018untrue\u2019.[6] \u00a0She stated \u2018for looking into the matter seriously I find I have never been anything else, therefore, I never really became a suffragist, I was born one and the tale I have to tell is rather how I came to realise I was and must remain one at whatever the personal cost\u2019.[7]\nThe suffrage years\nRose joined the Wimbledon branch of the WSPU soon after it was founded in January 1909 and immediately became a member of the committee. \u00a0However, it was February 1909 that was said, by Mary Leigh, to be the date that \u2018a new life was to open out for Rose\u2019, as it was on 22 February 1909 (the eve of Rose\u2019s 34th birthday) that she attended a public meeting held in Wimbledon where Christabel Pankhurst was the chief speaker.[8] \u00a0During the meeting, Rose felt a \u2018definite call\u2019 and when she arrived home from the meeting, together with Tom she wrote the telegram offering her services to the WSPU for the next deputation.\nOn 24 February 1909, Rose attended a deputation, led by Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, from Caxton Hall to the House of Commons, to present a petition under the Bill of Rights to the Prime Minister Herbert Asquith.[9] \u00a0However, Rose was seized by police officers when she attempted to deliver the petition and was subsequently arrested along with 28 other women and charged with \u2018obstructing the police in the execution of their duty\u2019.[10] Despite her husband acting for her defence, she received one month\u2019s imprisonment in Holloway prison. Her son Paul was just eight months old at the time of her imprisonment and the satirical magazine Punch printed a set of verses criticising her for leaving him. Rose defended her decision on leaving Paul not just in her court hearing but also in various speeches that she gave on her prison experience, stating that he was left in the care of her husband, a nurse and \u2018the gardener\u2019s capable wife\u2019.[11] \u00a0On her return to Wimbledon, Rose\u2019s house had been decorated in the colours of the WSPU to mark the occasion and at the end of April 1909, Rose was awarded the new illuminated addresses (given to all WSPU members who had served at least one week\u2019s imprisonment) and a Holloway Prison brooch.[12]\nOn her return from prison Rose continued as an active member of the Wimbledon WSPU and by the end of 1909 she had replaced Margaret Grant as the Wimbledon WSPU\u2019s Honorary Organising Secretary. \u00a0When Rose took on this position within the local Union, she essentially became an unpaid, full time worker for the WSPU. \u00a0In her capacity as Honorary Organising Secretary she organised and addressed local meetings, oversaw management of the local WSPU shop, enrolled new members, organised local suffragette bazaars and garden fetes, contributed weekly reports to the local, national and suffrage press, and most famously defended women\u2019s right to free speech on Wimbledon Common, speaking there at 3.00pm every Sunday on women\u2019s issues. \u00a0Rose not only became the face of the Wimbledon suffrage campaign, she was also the driving force behind the local movement and was the key to its success.[13] \u00a0Between 1909 and 1911, Rose, along with other Wimbledon volunteers, increased the turnover for the Wimbledon WSPU by over 1000%; their annual turnover rising from \u00a323 in 1909 to \u00a3328 in 1911.\nIn addition to all her commitments as Wimbledon WSPU\u2019s Honorary Organising Secretary, Rose also opened up her Wimbledon home, Dorset Hall, to suffrage activists who were in need of recuperation from their exhausting daily schedules. The most notable suffragettes to have stayed are Emily Wilding Davison, Mary Leigh and Mary Gawthorpe. WSPU organiser, Mary Gawthorpe, actually stayed with the Lamartine Yates family for six months from October 1910 whilst recuperating from a condition Mary described as \u2018overstrain and injury received in the votes for women campaign\u2019.[14]\nNevertheless, it wasn\u2019t just suffragettes that Rose and Tom welcomed into their home. In 1913 Rose was the \u2018first guard of honour\u2019 to Emily Wilding Davison\u2019s coffin, and opened up her house to Emily\u2019s brother, Captain Davison, during the inquest and the funeral. \u00a0Their generosity to the Davison family is apparent in a letter that the Captain wrote to Tom, thanking them for their kindness and support with the funeral and inquest (Tom was the solicitor who represented the Davison family at the inquest). \u00a0After Emily\u2019s funeral Rose took nearly a year off from the Wimbledon WSPU due to a \u2018severe illness.\u2019 [15] \u00a0After several attempts to recover from her illness in \u2018the fray\u2019, she was \u2018ordered abroad for rest.\u2019[16] \u00a0During this time the Wimbledon WSPU was organised by the Union\u2019s second in command, Edith Begbie.\nWomen\u2019s suffrage and World War I\nBy the summer of 1914, Rose had returned as Honorary Organising Secretary of the Wimbledon WSPU but soon afterwards war was declared. \u00a0WSPU members were informed of the \u2018temporary suspension of militant activity until the conflict was over\u2019.[17] \u00a0The Pankhurst leadership argued that to secure votes for women they needed a \u2018national victory\u2019 since \u2018what would be the good of a vote without a country to vote in!\u2019.[18] \u00a0However, Rose and the Wimbledon WSPU didn\u2019t agree with this decision. \u00a0In their local 1914 annual report, they record that \u2018the subject of women\u2019s enfranchisement was still a concern for many local women\u2019 and because of this, the branch chose to \u2018keep in touch with the only subject which unites all suffragists\u2019 by holding weekly meetings, readings and discussions at 3.00pm on Saturday afternoons. This was open to \u2018members and their friends\u2019.[19] \u00a0This continuance of suffragette meetings by the Wimbledon WSPU into 1915 is highly significant as they were the only local WSPU branch that is known to have defied instruction and continue their local meetings. Not only did they continue their meetings but in September 1914, Rose tried to minimise the suffering brought upon women and children in the locality by reason of the war by persuading the WSPU committee to transform the bottom floor of their WSPU shop into a cost-price restaurant. \u00a0In just one year the restaurant served over 40,000 meals.\nWith the restaurant a success, Rose turned her attention onto what she felt was the most pressing issue at this time. \u00a0In 1915, this was still votes for women. \u00a0Rose and many other women such as Mary Leigh, Dorothy Evans and Annie Cobden Sanderson were all united in their disapproval of the WSPU leadership\u2019s decision to no longer use the WSPU\u2019s name, and its platform, to campaign for women\u2019s suffrage.[20] Consequently, on 5 December 1915, Rose and the temporary executive proceeded to devote themselves to suffrage work and acted \u2018untidily as a group of the WSPU for suffrage only\u2019.\n\u2018The Suffragettes of the WSPU\u2019, as the organisation became known, resumed \u2018the highly important social and political work of the WSPU\u2019.[21] \u00a0Meetings of the Suffragettes of the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union (SWSPU) took place at least once a week throughout 1916 and 1917 and the SWSPU newsletter, The Suffragette News Sheet, was sold on the streets of London. The SWSPU also contributed to the wartime campaign for women\u2019s enfranchisement by signing circular letters to parliament, attending pickets at the House of Commons and taking part in collective deputations to parliament with organisations such as the East London Federation of Suffragettes, the United Suffragists, and the Women\u2019s Freedom League.\nLife after votes for women\nOn 6 February 1918, the Representation of the People Act received Royal Assent, giving the vote to some women over the age of 30 who met a property qualification and to all men over the age of 21. \u00a0With votes for some women achieved, Rose\u2019s focus altered. With the support of the National Federation of Women Teachers, she was elected in 1919 to the London County Council (LCC). \u00a0Rose\u2019s election to the LCC provided her with a platform on which she, as a practical woman and mother, could use her voice and influence to help improve the lives of women and children in North Lambeth by shaping the local political agenda and ensuring that local women and children were a priority. \u00a0Whilst serving on the LCC, Rose worked tirelessly to improve the living conditions of North Lambeth residents, suggesting and implementing house plans that would benefit housewives and working women. \u00a0She also \u2018persistently supported every effort to improve the tram service and reduce the fares\u2019 notably securing the halfpenny fare for children in her constituency. \u00a0Moreover, her work for equal treatment of women regarding their wages was tireless, and in 1920 she secured a LCC grant which enabled a minor ailment children\u2019s centre to be opened in North Lambeth in 1921, named The Rose Lamartine Yates Clinic. The clinic remained an integral part of North Lambeth\u2019s health care system up until 1958 when it was closed and offered to the National Health Service. Although Rose only served on the LCC until 1922, she remained as the Honorary Treasurer of the clinic until 1934.\nIn 1938 Rose was one of the prime movers behind the establishment of The Women\u2019s Record House at 6 Great Smith Street in Westminster, London, which she opened in May 1939. It housed a vast range of suffragette material from banners to postcards. Each room had its own theme: the early beginnings of the movement, the militant phase, prison records, souvenirs and reminiscences.[22] \u00a0\u00a0However, the existence of the Women\u2019s Record House was short-lived, as it had to close in September 1939 \u2018on account of the war\u2019.[23] \u00a0The \u2018suffrage records were distributed to places of safety\u2019.[24] \u00a0The records that Rose contributed to the collection were taken back to her house for safekeeping and it appears that she never returned them as there is comparatively little that relates to her, or the Wimbledon WSPU, within The Suffragette Fellowship Collection at the Museum of London today.\nAfter the establishment of the Record House, Rose was never again active in public life. \u00a0Instead, she settled in her flat in Putney, London, and \u2018delighted in her grandchildren\u2019- whom she adored. \u00a0In 1951, she bought her son a house in Sevenoaks, Kent and \u2018visited frequently\u2019.[25] \u00a0Just three years later, after a brief illness, she died of colon cancer at the age of 79. \u00a0She was buried next to her beloved husband, Tom, in the family\u2019s plot in St Matthew Avenue, Brookwood Cemetery.[26]\nDr Alexandra Hughes-Johnson is a historian of 19th and 20th century Britain with a particular interest in women, gender, health and political activism.

And it\u2019s a reminder that change is possible, but we must keep pushing and be ever vigilant.\nWhen I heard about the Emmeline Pankhurst Statue Campaign commission in 2016, I was so excited. \u00a0It would be perfect. \u00a0It would combine two of my passions. \u00a0Before becoming a sculptor, I had worked for many years promoting women\u2019s rights and gender equality internationally. \u00a0This makes me rather unique. \u00a0And this commission would give me an opportunity to express, without words, what this centenary means to me, what Emmeline Pankhurst and the suffragettes mean to me, and what the radical women of Manchester, past and present, mean to me.\nMy statue design is simple. \u00a0The suffragettes are on the streets, ringing bells, summoning people from their homes, offices and factories. \u00a0Someone grabs a kitchen chair as a makeshift rostrum. \u00a0The five foot Emmeline climbs atop. \u00a0Spurred on by the injustice women face, she addresses the noisy crowds, urging women to rise up and demand the vote. \u00a0Emmeline is portrayed as the dynamic, courageous, determined, dignified and elegant activist she was.\nWinning the commission, and the public vote for my design, was exciting beyond words. \u00a0But I immediately felt the weighty responsibility to create a statue that the people of Manchester, and particularly the strong women of Manchester, would be proud of. \u00a0I was moved by how people embraced my design. \u00a0They \u2018got\u2019 what I was trying to say. \u00a0In fact, they often articulated it better than me. \u00a0And they had sensed my deep political commitment.\nI must say it has been a huge privilege to sculpt Emmeline. \u00a0And it has been a real labour of love. \u00a0Why do I admire her so? \u00a0She had the ability to inspire women of all classes to take to the streets, to claim what should be rightfully theirs. \u00a0She had enormous courage and tenacity even in the face of violent resistance. \u00a0And she brought about new forms of activism and pioneered concerns that later became central to feminist thinking. \u00a0One day I was walking by the lake near my studio, when the reality hit home \u2013 I\u2019m sculpting Emmeline Pankhurst, yes THE Emmeline Pankhurst.\nIt has also been a real honour to work with the Emmeline Pankhurst Statue Campaign. \u00a0We have been on a journey together, learning lots, laughing lots. \u00a0I am so grateful to Councillor Andrew Simcock, the chair of the campaign, for his vision and for putting his trust in me. \u00a0And for Helen Pankhurst, Emmeline\u2019s great granddaughter, who has been our modern day inspiration, and a wonderful and supportive person to boot. \u00a0It has been warming to see how the project has proactively connected with the public and forged links with other key players in Manchester, like the Pankhurst Centre and People\u2019s History Museum.\nSculpting Emmeline also gave me the opportunity to work side by side with two amazing women, who also felt the responsibility of getting it right, getting it done: Sarah Jenkins, my model for Emmeline, and all round fabulous feminist; and my artist sister, Sandra Reeves, ever ready with artistic or technical support. \u00a0They kept me going. \u00a0I couldn\u2019t have done it without them. Hats off.\nAnd how otherwise would I have met \u2013 and hung out with \u2013 so many amazing Manchester women. \u00a0What a privilege. \u00a0Some even came to visit me in the studio, giving me a real boost. \u00a0I was joined by women councillors from across Manchester and women from Wythenshawe Safespots, the user-led domestic abuse organisation. \u00a0These modern day Emmelines are working tirelessly to realise women\u2019s rights and make gender equality a reality. \u00a0It\u2019s these women, and the next generation of women activists, I will dedicate the statue to.\nIt\u2019s Helen Pankhurst\u2019s vision that the unveiling should be an occasion that sees people gather from across Greater Manchester to march and sing on their way to meet Our Emmeline. Marchers will gather near the Pankhurst Centre (at 10.30am) and the People\u2019s History Museum is just a short walk to the starting point at Great Northern Square at 11.15am, and then converge collectively at St Peter\u2019s Square ready for some rousing singing led by the Manchester Community Choir. \u00a0The unveiling proceedings will commence at 12 noon. \u00a0Come join us on this most significant of days.\nBut it is on the next day, Saturday 15 December, that Our Emmeline starts her work, inspiring current and future generations of women to rise up and use their vote, use their voice and champion the rights of those left behind.\u2019\n\n"}, {"link": "https://phm.org.uk/blogposts/steven-fielding-highlights-five-objects-in-a-series-of-films-for-phm/", "category": "", "title": "Steven Fielding highlights five objects in a series of films for PHM", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-12-06 00:00:00", "text": "Steven Fielding, Professor of Political History at the University of Nottingham\u00a0discusses the five highlights he chose from the People\u2019s History Museum\u2019s collection for a series of new films.\n\u2018The People\u2019s History Museum\u2019s (PHM) collections and exhibitions allow visitors to explore Britain\u2019s often dramatic and always controversial democratic history.\nPHM is highlighting five objects from the museum\u2019s unique collection in a series of films, with assistance from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the University of Nottingham. \u00a0In these films I explain the objects\u2019 relevance to our own times, and for those who want to take their journey into the past a bit further, link them to the national Labour Party archive; the complete holdings of which are housed at the museum.\nWhen deciding which items to talk about, my task was incredibly difficult, given the huge choice on display in the museum\u2019s two main galleries. There is certainly scope for more films, but this is what I came up with!\nHousing is one of the most pressing issues in Britain today so it seemed obvious to talk about two Labour and Conservative Party posters taken from the 1950 and 1951 general elections which addressed this issue. \u00a0Britain already had a housing crisis before 1939 but it was made worse due to the bombing of many of its cities during World War II. \u00a0Inspired by the belief that returning soldiers, war workers and their families deserved a better life, despite huge shortages of labour and materials, the Labour government elected in 1945 built one million homes. \u00a0But more were still required, which is why the Conservative Party promised to build 300,000 homes a year, a pledge they lived up to when elected to office in 1951.\nBoth parties used their time in government to address Britain\u2019s housing problem. \u00a0With the country facing a similar crisis today however neither the Conservative government nor the Labour Party have embraced the methods required to properly solve it. \u00a0Perhaps they need to look back to their own histories to see how it might be done?\nBritain is more accepting of multiculturalism than ever it was; however, some think hostility to immigration lay behind much of the 2016 vote to leave the European Union (EU). \u00a0To highlight this issue, I chose a poster produced by the Labour Party Young Socialists in 1974. \u00a0The poster publicised a demonstration the party\u2019s youth wing organised to oppose growing racist hostility to non-white Commonwealth immigrants and their offspring. \u00a0The event took place in Bradford and was the first rally officially sanctioned by the national Labour Party to oppose racism which was at the time being stoked up by the fascist National Front party. \u00a0The 1960s Labour government had looked two ways on the issue; introducing laws to outlaw discrimination, but imposing controls designed to reduce only non-white immigration. \u00a0As this poster indicates however, in the face of rising support for far right groups, Labour assumed a more assertive anti-racist stance to actively change attitudes.\n\nWomen are still underrepresented in Britain\u2019s political system. \u00a0While there have been two female Prime Ministers since 1979, two-thirds of MPs elected in 2017 were men. \u00a0Misogynistic attitudes in the Palace of Westminster are also exposed by the media on a regular basis. Things may have improved, but there clearly remains much work to do. \u00a0The first election in which all women could vote was 1929, which is why I picked a poster the Labour Party produced for that contest. \u00a0Women over 30 were given the right to vote in 1918 along with all men over 21. \u00a0But those in their 20s had to wait; they were deemed too frivolous to vote. \u00a0This Labour Party poster was meant to appeal to these first time voters but it is a paradoxically sexist pitch. \u00a0It bizarrely shows the Liberal Party leader David Lloyd George and Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin as two aged suitors giving the eye to a young woman and presents the Labour Party\u2019s Ramsay MacDonald as her more appropriate consort even though, like the others, he was in his 60s!\n\nWe live in an era of fake news, when some believe our opinions are shaped by a social media corrupted by foreign powers and a mainstream media controlled by powerful interests. \u00a0However, the way we see our political leaders has always been mediated, and potentially distorted. \u00a0I was therefore keen to talk about one of the museum\u2019s most striking exhibits \u2013 the coat worn by the Labour Party leader Michael Foot at the National Service of\u00a0Remembrance, held at\u00a0The Cenotaph in Whitehall, London, on Remembrance Sunday, 1981. \u00a0This coat was depicted in the press as a donkey jacket, which is something a manual worker might wear. \u00a0As a result, it was widely believed that Foot, whose party then supported unilateral nuclear disarmament, had disrespected those who had sacrificed their lives in defence of the nation. \u00a0He was, the argument went, consequently unfit to become Prime Minister. \u00a0Yet, if you see the coat in the museum it is perfectly respectable and indeed Foot was praised by the Queen Mother for his choice. \u00a0But, as Foot\u2019s private papers held in the museum archive show, he received many letters from those who believed he had worn a donkey jacket.\nThanks to Brexit the language of patriotism now shapes much of our political discourse. Supporters of Leave sometimes cast advocates of Remain as traitors willing to bend the knee to Brussels, whereas Remain partisans claim that they are the true patriots as staying in the EU is in the national interest. \u00a0To highlight the persistence of patriotism I chose a Conservative Party poster produced in time for the 1924 general election.\nTo 1920s conservatives, patriotism meant keeping the country\u2019s established institutions safe from communism, which was being established pretty violently in Russia after the 1917 revolution. \u00a0As a socialist organisation the Labour Party shared ends similar to the communists \u2013 a more equal society \u2013 but was, unlike them, committed to achieving change through democratic means. \u00a0Some conservatives genuinely saw no difference between the Labour Party and the regime in Moscow. \u00a0Others were more perceptive but still cynically claimed the Labour Party was in favour of bloody revolution. \u00a0So, the poster asked voters to choose between two stark alternatives, the Union Jack or the Red Flag. \u00a0Given the terrible stories coming out of Russia at the time, it was a powerful form of propaganda that arguably helped the Conservative Party end the first Labour government by winning the 1924 general election.\nBritain\u2019s democratic history is an unfinished story. \u00a0It is one in which we can all play a part. These films show that looking at that history can help us better understand the present. \u00a0If they demonstrate how far we have come, they also show how far we have yet to go.\u2019\nSee all five films on PHM\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\n"}, {"link": "https://phm.org.uk/blogposts/phms-new-playwright-in-residence/", "category": "", "title": "PHM's New Playwright in Residence Blog 1 of 3",

relationship).\u00a0 I\u2019d only just come out.\u00a0 Bad timing.\u00a0 Alan gathered gay men under his wing and gently but decisively politicised us.\u00a0 And then I\u2019m stood in his garden handing out burgers to men in black leather jackets, one of them was Peter Tatchell.\u00a0 It was our first fleeting connection.\n\nManchester, February 1988 and I\u2019m on a train from London packed with a huge number of gays and lesbians, all impossibly, joyously out, and angry.\u00a0 The mood is one of defiance.\u00a0 We\u2019re ready to be welcomed by a wonderful city, but bristling with defiance to the anticipated rough treatment by the notoriously homophobic Greater Manchester Police.\u00a0 Peter is at the head of the march.\u00a0 I catch his eye at one point and smile.\u00a0 I wonder if I should go over and say hello, presume that he remembers me from the BBQ months earlier, the nervous drama student who handed him a slightly charred bap.\u00a0 Perhaps.\u00a0 Perhaps not. \u00a0My diffidence means the moment evaporates and Peter is swept on.\nDuring the 1990s, I followed his activism on telly.\u00a0 I have a job now.\u00a0 A proper job as a Probation Officer.\u00a0 My activism is more individualised.\u00a0 I don\u2019t do protests much anymore.\u00a0 Peter does.\u00a0 He founds gay rights group OutRage! and disrupts the Easter sermon by the then Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey.\u00a0 He gets arrested.\u00a0 He tries to arrest Robert Mugabe.\u00a0 He gets badly beaten.\u00a0 He becomes a remote televisual figure and my life drifts back into theatre.\u00a0 I become a playwright, a proper one, and that leads me somehow to becoming the first LGBT History Month Playwright in Residence.\u00a0 My own little part of the past to play with.\nIt\u2019s 2015.\u00a0 LGBT History Month is holding its first ever history festival.\u00a0 I now live in Manchester, where the festival is being held.\u00a0 We\u2019re staging a three part theatre piece, A Very Victorian Scandal, about the largest ever police raid on a LGBT venue in Hulme, Manchester in 1880.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing it in Via, a vibrant pub on Manchester\u2019s Canal Street, in the city\u2019s Gay Village.\u00a0 There\u2019s actors in period costumes, musicians, can-can boys, an international audience.\u00a0 We sort of have permission to re-stage the raid in police uniforms\u2026.sort of.\n\nAnd suddenly I\u2019m asked to meet a Mr Tatchell at the door and escort him into a reserved area.\u00a0 There he is.\u00a0 I recognise him, of course.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t recognise me.\u00a0 Why would he?\u00a0 And I whisk him through the crowd to meet Sister Mercy, a man dragged up as a nun who is part of the performance.\u00a0 That man is Alan Beck, and for a brief second we are all in the same moment again, as we were in 1988, all the same, all completely different.\nIt\u2019s time now.\u00a0 I get out of the cafe and back into the rain.\u00a0 It\u2019s time to meet Peter.\u00a0 For the fourth time, but also for the first.\u00a0 I walk up some stairs on the side of the building and knock on the door.\u2019\nStephen\u2019s work began with a detailed study of the Labour Party archives, the complete holdings of which are held at PHM, where the museum also holds some of the personal papers of Tatchell. \u00a0The project is supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and the University of Salford.\nStephen\u2019s play, First Rumours, will premiere as a rehearsed reading at People\u2019s History Museum on Sunday 10 February 2019 at 3.00pm as part of OUTing the Past, the national festival for LGBT history and the museum\u2019s 2019 programme, which is dedicated to exploring the past, present and future of protest. \u00a0The reading will be followed by a Q&A with Peter Tatchell, facilitated by LGBT activist and historian Paul Fairweather.\n"}, {"link":

programme exploring the past, present and future of representation, marking 100 years since the passing of the Representation of the People Act (1918) and since all men and some women won the right to vote in Britain, we have been encouraging people to discuss, discover and reflect upon one of the great milestones for equality, and what representation means to them 100 years on.\nI would like to share with you PHM\u2019s recent project with\u00a0Falinge Park High School\u00a0(Falinge Park) in Rochdale, who have been working with the museum to explore their own ideas of representation.\nRochdale is an area with a long social history and is the birthplace of the co-operative movement. \u00a0It is home to many different communities and this is reflected in Falinge Park High School where over 50 languages are spoken. \u00a0Their head teacher, Janice Allen, was keen to promote a sense of shared history amongst different communities at a time of divisions in society and against the backdrop of a recent rise in far right groups in Britain.\nOver the course of the last year, 15 students have discussed some of the issues facing Rochdale, learnt about its history and thought about how they could promote a more positive and harmonious place to live.\nThe project included a visit to PHM to watch one of the museum\u2019s popular Living History performances,\u00a0Moving Stories \u2013 Migration & Identity, which looks at the life of a young girl who was born in Manchester and whose parents came from India. \u00a0Moving Stories\u00a0explores the themes of both migration and identity. \u00a0Also at the museum, the students debated issues that mattered to them in a Have Your Say workshop, where current issues, linked to the museum\u2019s collection are explored. \u00a0In addition to all this the students set up and ran a stall at Bury Market to find out from the general public what local attitudes were to their neighbouring multicultural town.\nThe project finished with a two day art session, facilitated by artist Alex Godwin aka\u00a0Billy.\nBilly and the students worked together to make a series of simple, bold and visually striking flags showing themes of equality, civil rights and the representation of people today. \u00a0The students raised questions about gender norms, diversity and representation using colourful and positive techniques demonstrated by Billy and her creative practice. \u00a0Following a series of collaborative workshops, the final artwork shows a visual language highlighting the notion that 100 years on from the Representation of the People Act (1918) we can be happy about achieving a certain equality amongst people in today\u2019s society, but there is still a long way to go before everyone can feel equally and\u00a0completely\u00a0represented. See a film of the artwork being created on PHM\u00a0Facebook.\nThe group\u2019s large scale artwork proudly introduces visitors at the museum to the\u00a0Represent! Voices 100 Years On\u00a0exhibition, on display until Sunday 3 February 2019.\nThis Family Friendly, Heritage Lottery Fund supported exhibition features objects which help to paint a picture of what representation meant in 1918 alongside crowdsourced items telling the very personal stories of today\u2019s movements and campaigns, giving a platform to those who are still fighting to make their voices heard today.\nOne Falinge Park student described their work, as showing \u201chow we want to live in equality and diversity and peace\u201d and labelled their artwork,\u00a0Opposites Attract.\nAt PHM we offer an engaging Learning Programme for all ages, inspiring early years, schools, colleges, universities and community groups to find out why there are ideas worth fighting for.\n"}, {"link": "https://phm.org.uk/blogposts/solemn-reflections-for-armistice-day/", "category": "", "title": "Solemn reflections for Armistice Day", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-11-09 00:00:00", "text": "Jenny van Enckevort, Conservation Manager at People\u2019s History Museum, discussing a banner she is currently working on.\nTo mark Armistice Day I would like to reflect on the tragic family story behind a banner I am currently working on in\u00a0The Conservation Studio\u00a0at the People\u2019s History Museum (PHM).\nThis is a National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) Achinleck Branch banner now belonging to the granddaughter of Alexander Sloan who is featured in the portrait on the banner.\u00a0 Alexander or \u2018Sanny\u2019 and he was known, was born in 1879, one of 12 children.\u00a0 They were part of a mining community in South Ayrshire, Scotland.\u00a0 The children started work at 12 years old, the boys in the mine and the girl as a farm servant.\u00a0 While still a child Sanny was involved in a pit accident and lost the sight in one eye.\nFive of the sons fought in World War I and four were killed; Robert the baby of the family died first aged just 19 on the 22 April 1915 at the Second Battle of Ypres.\u00a0 He had emigrated to Canada in 1913 so was fighting for the Canadian Expedition Force.\u00a0 William had also moved to Canada, he described himself as a miner when he joined the Canadian Expedition Force.\u00a0 He served as a sapper for the 2nd Canadian Tunnelling Company, he died on the 28 June 1916 aged 23.\u00a0 Sanny was a miner and not conscripted; he was also a pacifist.\nThomas and Charles were also in Canada but moved back to Scotland to join up in 1914.\u00a0 Thomas worked briefly at Woodmuir Colliery near Bathgate before joining the Scots Guards.\u00a0 He was killed aged 28 on the 15 September 1916, leaving behind a wife Mary Anne and young son.\u00a0 Mary Anne later remarried but still had Thomas\u2019s letters in her handbag when she passed away as an old lady.\nThe telegrams telling their mother the heartbreaking news that both William and Thomas were dead arrived on the same day.\u00a0 Sanny wrote to the war office requesting that his brother Donald, who was fighting on the front line, be moved to a slightly safer posting, the response came back saying that it was an honour to die for your country.\u00a0 Donald died on the 1 January 1917 aged 33 he fought with the Royal Highlanders Black Watch.\u00a0 He was married with four children and was a professional footballer with Everton and Liverpool football clubs.\nLikely as a result of these experiences Sanny was a pacifist throughout his adult life and became dedicated serving his community, he got involved in campaigns for safer working conditions in the mines and was known for assisting workers with claims for compensation.\u00a0 As a councillor, serving for 25 years, he fought for improvements to housing and education and as a Labour MP, for six years, he made his voice heard with 640 interjections in parliament during that time.\n\n\n\nThe NUM Achinleck Branch banner circa 1940 is reportedly designed and painted by Richard Strain a Pithead Worker at Barony Coal Mine who was noted as having a flair for sign writing.\u00a0 It is made from a canvas cloth and is painted on both sides with oil medium.\u00a0 The face side features a portrait of Alexander Sloan surrounded by a wreath of coal, it also depicts a pair of thistles and arms with pick axes (the tools of the trade).\u00a0 Above the images is the title, \u2018National Union of Mineworkers Achinleck Branch\u2019 and below a ribbon scroll bearing the motto \u2018We swear fidelity\u2019.\u00a0 The reverse side features a ribbon scroll repeating the branch name and \u2018National Union of Mineworkers\u2019 beneath.\u00a0 After active use the banner was kept in Achinleck Town Hall where it lay undisturbed until the 1980s before the building was demolished, it was then moved to a garden shed before returning to Sanny Sloan\u2019s family.\nThe banner came to The Conservation Studio at PHM in January 2018 with conservation beginning in summer 2018.\u00a0 The condition is very poor as a result of its previous storage conditions; the canvas has been weakened leading to structural tears and losses.\u00a0 The surface is covered in soiling, mould deposits and waterborne staining.\u00a0 The paint is poorly adhered to the surface in many areas making it difficult to handle and even clean safely without enduring further losses.\u00a0 The treatment proposal includes cleaning to remove soiling and stains, where possible, working methodically in 10cm by 10cm squares.\u00a0 This will be followed by consolidation of the loose paint fragments using a conservation grade adhesive.\u00a0 The banner will then be fully supported with a transparent layer on the reverse side and the areas of loss will be filled with a sympathetic fabric, coloured to match the original.\n"}, {"link": "https://phm.org.uk/blogposts/remembering-peterloo/", "category": "", "title": "Remembering Peterloo", "author": "", "timestamp": "2018-11-01 00:00:00", "text": "Shirin Hirsch, Researcher at People\u2019s History Museum, discusses Mike Leigh\u2019s new film and introduces how you can discover the legacy of the Peterloo Massacre at PHM.\n\u201cPeterloo, lad! I know. I were theer as a young mon. We were howdin\u2019 a meetin\u2019 i\u2019 Manchester \u2013 on Peter\u2019s Field, \u2013 a meetin\u2019 for eawr reets \u2013 for reets o\u2019 mon, for liberty to vote, an\u2019 speak, an\u2019 write, an\u2019 be eawrselves \u2013 honest, hard-workin\u2019 folk. We wanted to live eawr own lives, an\u2019 th\u2019 upper classes wouldn\u2019t let us\u2026. Burns says as \u2018Liberty\u2019s a glorious feast.\u2019 But th\u2019 upper classes wouldn\u2019t let us poor folk get a tast on it. When we cried\u2026 freedom o\u2019 action they gav\u2019 us t\u2019 point of a sword. Never forget, lad! Let it sink i\u2019 thi blood. Ston up an\u2019 feight for t\u2019 reets o\u2019 mon \u2013 t\u2019 reets o\u2019 poor folk!\u201d\nSo explained Joss Wrigley when asked what Peterloo was all about. \u00a0Wrigley was only 19 years of age when he escaped the Manchester massacre of 1819, but the memory of Peterloo would never leave him.\u00a0 Wrigley remained throughout his life a poor handloom weaver.\u00a0 As an old man Wrigley was the leader of a \u2018poverty stricken group\u2019 of weavers who worked together in a cellar, and when the looms were quiet they talked by candlelight discussing politics and sharing working class history.\u00a0 We know all this because James Haslam, the son of one of these weavers, would sit and listen. \u00a0What rang in the ears of this young boy, as he listened to the collective murmurings of the weavers, was Peterloo. \u00a0He noted how, for Joss Wrigley, a survivor of the massacre, Peterloo had got into his blood \u201cand he could not live it out.\u201d \u00a0Continuous years of poverty, together with years of political injustice and vagaries \u201chad helped to nurse his hatred, which he resolutely passed on to others\u201d. \u00a0On the centenary of the Peterloo Massacre, the boy who had sat and listened to these conversations wrote down his memories of this group and they were published in\u00a0The Manchester Guardian.\u00a0 Haslam asked: \u201cAnd who can say how much the working classes owe to men like Joss Wrigley \u2013 a poor handloom weaver who from his obscurity passed on their spirit and opinions to coming generations?\u201d\nMike Leigh\u2019s film\u00a0Peterloo\u00a0continues to pass on this spirit. \u00a0The film is a powerful cinematic intervention in bringing to life the mass organising, protest and repression of working class people in 1819. \u00a0The scene of the Peterloo Massacre feels only too real as we watch the yeomanry (government forces) cut down protestors in St Peter\u2019s Field. \u00a0This is a history from below that Leigh\u2019s film now brings vividly to our screens. \u00a0In the questions and answers following the premier of the film, Mike Leigh and Maxine Peake both noted that the history of the massacre was rarely taught in schools and, even for people growing up in Manchester and Salford, the memory of Peterloo was far from widespread.\nThe film is immersed in historical sources and literature, including research undertaken here at People\u2019s History Museum. \u00a0We hope that this film will initiate a wider discussion and interest in the history of democracy and struggle \u2013 a springboard to PHM\u2019s 2019 programme of exhibitions, events and learning sessions, marking the bicentenary of Peterloo, exploring the\u00a0past present and future of protest.\n\nPHM\u2019s collections tell the story of the Peterloo Massacre through visual materials and objects. \u00a0On the handkerchief above, on display in Main Gallery One, you can see a snapshot of the Peterloo Massacre. \u00a0The top of the handkerchief reads: \u2018The Manchester Reform Meeting Dispersed by the Civil and Military Power\u2019 and bordering the handkerchief are three demands \u2018Universal Suffrage\u2019, \u2018Annual Parliament\u2019 and \u2019Election by Ballot\u2019. \u00a0In the background you can see many of the buildings that surrounded St Peter\u2019s Field, including a large cotton mill, a monument to the economic power of the rapidly growing industrial town of Manchester. \u00a0Yet there was no Member of Parliament for the whole of Manchester at the turn of the 19th century.\nThere are estimates of 60,000 people congregating in St Peter\u2019s Field at the moment the yeomanry attack on horseback. \u00a0You can see on the handkerchief many different banners held, often with the cap of liberty on the top of the stick, a symbol of the French revolution. \u00a0\u2018Unite and be Free\u2019 and \u2018Taxation without representation is unjust and tyrannical\u2019 are just some of the slogans shown. \u00a0The \u2018hustings\u2019, where the speakers stood on a platform are also depicted, with Henry Hunt as the main orator, alongside speakers including Mary Fildes, the President of the Manchester Female Reform Society. \u00a0On the handkerchief you can see one of the banners is inscribed with the words \u2018Royton Female Union Society\u2019, showing the large and organised section of women protestors emerging within the reform movement.\nDespite the chaos shown in the picture, this was not an accidental massacre.\u00a0 In the film we watch the discussions as the local magistrates give the order to disperse the crowds, and in the build up to the protest the yeomanry are seen sharpening their sabres (swords with a curved blade). \u00a0Two of these sabres are on display in Main Gallery One, passed down through generations and kept under a bed in Droylsden before being donated to the museum.\n\nThere are wide ranging estimates of how many were killed at Peterloo. \u00a0It is hard to be exact with these statistics as there are huge debates as to who should be counted. \u00a0Do we only count people who died on the day? \u00a0Or people who died days, months or even years after, from lasting injuries?\u00a0 It is also highly likely that some of those killed are not on the surviving casualty lists, which were compiled not long after the massacre. \u00a0Historian Michael Bush has carried out analysis of the casualty lists and estimates that 18 were killed at Peterloo, and other historians estimate around 700 were injured.\nThe handkerchief we have on display was just one way of keeping alive the memory of Peterloo. \u00a0The British government was keen to cover up the massacre, imprisoning the reform leaders and clamping down on those who spoke out against the government. \u00a0Many of the commemorative Peterloo objects on display in Main Gallery One were created to break through this repression as material ways of refusing to forget. \u00a0To mark the bicentenary of Peterloo, PHM will continue this memory, not simply as a history lesson, but reflecting on protest and dissent from 1819 until the present day, and looking to protest of the future. \u00a0Why not visit People\u2019s History Museum and our\u00a0Archive & Study Centre\u00a0to continue the debate on the Peterloo Massacre and its impact today.\nIn our archive we hold newspapers from across the world reporting on the Peterloo Massacre.\n\nIn the\u00a0museum shop\u00a0we have a wide range of books on the Peterloo Massacre including:\nMark Krantz,\u00a0Rise Like Lions: The History of the Peterloo Massacre,\u00a0\u00a33\nThis pamphlet has recently been republished by Bookmarks publishers \u2013 an accessible and exciting way into this
