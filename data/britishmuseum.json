The upshot of the show\u2019s success? Just 10 days after its release, eBay announced a 273 percent rise in searches for chess sets.\nAnd yet, while chess is certainly having a moment, it\u2019s a board game that\u2019s centuries old, believed to have started in India in the AD 600s. Of course, at the British Museum, we\u2019re lucky enough to have an important part of chess history in our collection \u2013 the Lewis Chessmen.\nIf you\u2019re newly fascinated with all things chess, let us further enchant you with seven facts about these miniature masterpieces.\n1. They\u2019re named after the Isle of Lewis\nThe chess pieces were found on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland, but it\u2019s not certain where they were from or how they got to the island. However, a popular theory is that they were made in Trondheim in western Norway around 1150\u20131200. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, Trondheim was a centre for walrus ivory carving in the Middle Ages; secondly, a fragment of a queen piece in a similar style was found in a local church; and finally, the decoration on the Chessmen\u2019s thrones resemble carvings in medieval Norwegian churches.\nThe thrones of two king and two queen pieces, showing entwined tendrils and monsters.\nSo who would have been playing chess in the Middle Ages?\nFrom 7th-century India, the game passed to the Middle East and then to Europe where the style of the pieces became more figurative and reflected positions in royal courts, such as kings, queens, bishops and knights. Chess was popular with the nobility and although some members of the church disapproved of the game it came to be associated with courtliness and chivalry.\n2. Their owners remain a mystery\nThey might have belonged to a trader who was travelling from Norway to Ireland to sell them, who stopped at Lewis on route. This is possible as the hoard contains nearly enough pieces for four distinct sets (there are 78 known pieces in the British Museum and the National Museum of Scotland) and they don\u2019t show signs of use.\nAnother theory is that they were intended for local nobility on the island. However, no one can be sure when or why they were deposited. Various stories \u2013 involving everything from a grazing cow revealing the hoard to a sailor, to even murder \u2013 have evolved to explain why they were buried and how they were discovered. All that\u2019s certain is that they were found some time before 11 April 1831, when they were exhibited in Edinburgh at the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.\nWilliam Daniell (1769\u20131837), Stornaway on the Isle of Lewis. Aquatint and etching on paper, with hand-colouring, 1819.\n3. They\u2019re made of walrus ivory and sperm whale tooth\nWalrus ivory was widely used in northern Europe for luxury carvings \u2013 the narrow tusk was suitable for making gaming pieces. The hoard they are part of includes other objects made of walrus ivory, an ornate belt buckle and 14 blank discs, which would have been later carved with decoration and used as gaming pieces. The tusks used for the Lewis Chessmen may have come from Greenland, which had a good trading relationship with Norway in the Middle Ages.\nBelt buckle made of walrus ivory, found in the hoard along with the Lewis Chessmen pieces.\n4. They\u2019re very well-travelled\nThe Lewis Chessmen (and women) are some of the most well-travelled objects in the British Museum collection.\nSince 1995, various pieces have been shown in over 20 exhibitions around the world, so hundreds of thousands of people \u2013 possibly millions \u2013 have been able to see them. Their characterful expressions are instantly appealing, from the queens\u2019 worried manner to warriors biting their shields!\nThe Lewis Chessmen.\n5. They have a long history in the Museum\nStarting life in the (former) Department of Antiquities in 1831, the Lewis Chessmen were some of the first objects from medieval Europe in the Museum which, at the time, was more interested in objects from ancient Greece, Rome and Egypt. During the 1800s they were displayed with other ivory objects \u2013 a photo of the \u2018Medieval Room\u2019 from 1875 (below) shows a corner of a case where you can spot some of them. They are standing in a long line across the middle of the case, which looks like it contains ivory mirror cases. They can now be found in the Medieval Europe 1050\u20131500 gallery \u2013 usually with visitors peering in to see their expressions!\nThe Museum\u2019s Medieval Gallery in 1875. Photo by Frederick York.\n6. They\u2019re Hollywood famous\nWe can\u2019t talk about the Lewis Chessmen without mentioning a certain boy wizard. In 2001 the first Harry Potter film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone (or Sorcerer\u2019s Stone if you\u2019re American), used a replica of the Lewis chess set \u2013 owned by British Museum curator Irving Finkel \u2013 that Ron and Harry have to overcome near the film\u2019s climax. You can buy a replica of this set in the Museum shop \u2013 and hear Irving\u2019s take on \u2018the film that shall not be named\u2019 below.\nIrving Finkel on the Lewis Chessmen\n7. They\u2019ve taken on a life of their own\nToday the Lewis Chessmen have been replicated and reimagined in many different ways. As well as their Harry Potter cameo, they\u2019ve also appeared in the manga graphic novel Professor Munakata\u2019s British Museum Adventure and as a giant Lego sculpture made up of over 90,000 bricks, created at the National Museum of Scotland. Curator Naomi Speakman has even been sent photos of them recreated in cake by members of the public! And new 3D scans of some of the chessmen let visitors move the pieces around and enjoy them in a whole new way.\nThe Lewis Chessmen as featured in Hoshino Yukinobu\u2019s manga Professor Munakata\u2019a British Museum Adventure. \u00a9 YUKINOBU HOSHINO/SHOGAKUKAN INC.

Using both traditional and innovative methods and equipment, scientists \u2013 including me \u2013 are able to answer questions that help with the interpretation and understanding of objects in the collection, including:\nHow old is it?\nWhere does it come from?\nWhat is it made of?\nHow was it made?\nHere are six such objects with secrets that X-ray technology has helped reveal.\nBrass ewer\nOne of the star objects of the Albukhary Foundation Gallery of the Islamic world is this ewer (large jug) from Herat, modern-day Afghanistan, with beautiful birds surrounding the collar. With X-ray CT scanning (shown on the left above), we were able to determine how the birds were made. The X-rays can be very high in energy and are therefore very helpful for looking through metal objects such as this.\nOn the right of this picture is the X-ray tube. The X-rays come out from just behind the brass square in the centre, pass through the ewer and make an image on a digital detector.\nBy rotating the ewer while taking images, we can see the inside from all angles, allowing us to make a full 3D picture (which you can find out more about in this Twitter thread). Since the ewer is 40cm tall, I scanned it in two halves, top and bottom, then stitched the two halves together to give the result in the first image.\nX-ray image showing the changes in brightness that denote the different materials.\nIn the X-ray image above, we can see the silver inlaid design (it appears brighter because silver is denser than brass and so absorbs more X-rays) and various solder attachments. But what about the birds\u2019 heads?\nA video showing a cross-sectional view of the ewer.\nTo answer this question, we can go through the 3D picture of the ewer slice-by-slice \u2013 click to play the video above. On the right-hand side here, you can see that the bird head on the collar is a white outline, continuous with the body of the vessel (the handle is completely solid).\nThe birds\u2019 heads, thought to be parakeets or pheasants, were made by hammering outwards from the inside of the vessel and were not made separately and stuck on, as originally thought! It is clear that incredible artistry and skill was needed to make this ewer.\nDan in the X-ray imaging lab, working with another ewer.\nCuneiform tablet\nIn the ancient Near East, clay tablets were inscribed with text called cuneiform, as well as clay envelopes to hold letters or important documents. With X-ray CT imaging, we were able to virtually strip back the clay envelope surrounding this cuneiform tablet, allowing us to read text that hasn\u2019t been seen in over 4,000 years \u2013 without damaging the object!\nWith X-ray CT imaging, we were able to virtually strip back the clay envelope surrounding this Cuneiform tablet, allowing us to read text that hasn\u2019t been seen in over 4000 years \u2013 without damaging the artefact @britishmuseum @JonTaylor_BM pic.twitter.com/FkJTNiQCwa\n\u2014 Dr Dan O\u2019Flynn (@danoflynn) December 21, 2017\nThe X-ray scans revealed the following text, translated by curator Jonathan Taylor:\n2,427kg wool, as rations for the men of (the village) Gaka, under the supervision of the chief minister, via (Mr) Shesh-Utumu, from (Mr) Aradmu, governor of (the city) Girsu, have been withdrawn.\n(Sealed with) the seal of (Mr) Babati.\nYear Shu-Sin became king\nBy itself this information may seem insignificant, but it gives a valuable insight into the economic life of ancient Mesopotamia.\nTibetan thangka\nThis thangka (a painting on cloth) was featured in our recent major exhibition Tantra: enlightenment to revolution.\nAt the British Museum, we normally use X-ray imaging to look inside 3D objects, but it can also be effective on some more 2D objects including paintings and textiles. This Tibetan thangka depicts a Tantric teacher, or Mahasiddha (\u2018Great Accomplished One\u2019) called Saraha, and was discussed in our blog about its conservation treatment here.\nThe thangka after its conservation treatment, showing the colourful front side, as well as the reverse.\nConservation of the thangka was carried out in the Museum by conservators Alice Derham and Teresa Heady, and colour scientist Joanne Dyer to see if we could learn anything about the painting process.\nJoanne identified paints containing gold, lead, mercury, iron and copper on the thangka. X-rays are good at detecting these heavy elements on carbon-based backgrounds \u2013 such as cotton or paper \u2013 so we hoped to be able to see them in an X-ray image.\nThe X-ray image below shows details of the Mahasiddha Saraha. A reworking of the gold lines radiating from the Mahasiddaha Saraha can be seen, as well as brushstrokes from the application of red paint.\nDetail from the visible image and X-Radiograph of the thangka. The latter shows two sets of gold lines radiating from the Mahasiddha Saraha.\nGandharan heads\nIn 2019, the Museum worked with Border Force to identify and return a number of heads of Buddhist sculptures from Afghanistan that were damaged by the Taliban and illegally trafficked to the UK (read more here).\nMoulded and painted clay head of a female bodhisattva wearing a diadem (crown).\nCT scans revealed how the heads were made and scientific analysis showed that the red and yellow pigments found on the sculptures were made from common iron-rich ores.\nThis X-ray CT scan shows a \u2018slice\u2019 through one of the heads, helping show how it was made with a two-layer technique.\nAn X-ray CT scan of the heads revealed a two-layered construction. Firstly, a coarse clay was used to roughly model the shape of the head. Afterwards, the face, hair and headdress were overlaid with a finer and more compact material which was then painted. The rediscovery of the sculptures was a good opportunity to conduct this work and we are very grateful to the National Museum of Afghanistan for permitting us to do so.\nThis X-ray CT scan shows the internal composition of one of the heads, and how this type of imaging can show the hidden cross-section of objects without damaging them.\nBronze age axe mould\nThis mould was used to cast bronze axe-heads, and is over 3,000 years old.\nThis copper alloy mould came to the X-ray lab through the Portable Antiquities Scheme, which registers finds of treasure in the UK. This fascinating object is a 3,000+ year old Bronze Age mould for making palstave axes from southern England. The X-rays revealed the extent of the partially visible cracks in the two halves, and corrosion (seen as small dark circles on the images).\n3D models of the palstave axes made using moulds like this are available to view on Sketchfab here.\nX-rays showed the full extent of cracks that were only partially visible with the naked eye.\nTownley Discobolus\nDan in the X-ray lab with the Discobolus sculpture.\nThis marble sculpture shows an athlete stooping, about to throw a discus. It is one of several Roman copies made from a lost bronze original made in the 5th century BC.\nX-ray images have revealed the multiple restorations conducted before the statue came to the Museum. The statue is famed for having a head that does not belong to the original body. The head is very close in age and style, and uses marble that is exceptionally well matched to the torso, but it has been attached at the wrong angle! Complete statues from the time reveal the head to be turned to look towards the discus, rather than the floor.\nThe images below show some of the other, less visible, restorations.\nHere you can see the chin, mouth and nose have been reattached using metal rods for stabilisation.\nAnd the left index finger of the statue is actually a modern restoration (made of resin), of which we have a record. You can see a rod has also been used here.\nWe hoped you enjoyed this brief introduction to X-ray imaging at the Museum.

Image \u00a9 Creative Commons.\nOn the face of it, 19th century archaeology was a world of men. However, if you look carefully, you will see the significant contribution of women behind the scenes.\nMarguerite Naville (1852\u20131930) was the wife of Swiss Egyptologist Edouard Naville who ran the first excavations organised by the Egypt Exploration Fund with, as he confessed himself, no archaeological experience. Edouard Naville was omnipresent during my studies at the University of Geneva where he held the first professorship of Egyptology, but very little was said of Marguerite in spite of her crucial role in her husband\u2019s career.\nMarguerite not only raised their four children, but also copied and inked inscriptions, reliefs and monuments, developing new techniques that reflected both the state of a monument and its conservation. She drew many of the illustrations in her husband\u2019s publications, and one of the three volumes of an invaluable edition of the Book of the Dead fully consists of her plates. As with most Egyptologists, I regularly consulted these volumes which were until recently indispensable in the study of the Book of the Dead. Much of the photographic documentation and recordings of inscriptions as part of the excavation work in the temple of Deir el-Bahari (near Luxor) was by her.\nAt best, Marguerite\u2019s initials appear at the corner of the published illustrations, or her name pops up in the acknowledgments. Although she didn\u2019t appear to complain about this lack of recognition, it\u2019s important for us to remember that Edouard Naville and some of his contemporaries partly owed their successful careers to the work of their wives.\nMarguerite\u2019s drawing of two stone blocks, showing the barge transport of the obelisks from the lower terrace of the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari.\nA library pioneer: Belle da Costa Greene\nJeannette Plummer Sires, Curator, Archaeological Assemblages\nBelle da Costa Greene, pastel portrait by Paul C\u00e9sar Helleu, around 1913. Image \u00a9 Creative Commons.\nBelle da Costa Greene (1879\u20131950) was the first director of what is now the Morgan Library and Museum in New York City, and is one of the most important librarians and archivists in American history. Her story is one of hard work, intelligence and reinvention.\nBorn Belle Marion Greener, she was the daughter of the first Black-American graduate of Harvard University, Richard Theodore Greener. After becoming a diplomat, Mr Greener left his first family and started a new one in Siberia. In order to distance themselves from him, Belle, her mother and her siblings, who all passed as white, opted to change their names. Belle replaced her middle name with \u2018da Costa\u2019 \u2013 the association with Portuguese heritage used to explain her complexion.\nIn 1905, financier J.P. Morgan hired Belle to be his personal librarian and manage his expanding collection of rare books. She was hired for her expertise in illuminated (illustrated) manuscripts and savvy bargaining skills. Belle would go on to manage millions of dollars and make many trips to Europe acquiring rare books and artwork to expand the Morgan Library collection. She hoped to one day outdo the collection of British Museum (the book collection now held in the British Library) and the Biblioth\u00e9que Nationale.\nHer influence was so significant that in 1924 when the Morgan Library became a public institution, she was selected its inaugural Director and remained so until her retirement in 1948. During her time as Director, Belle not only built the collection but organised public exhibitions, improved bibliographical records and championed the work of female scholars and librarians. It is remarkable to consider that she was able to rise to such a powerful role and accomplish so much as a Black woman during segregation in the United States.\nMaster conservator: Prof. Elizabeth Pye\nDuygu Camurcuoglu ACR, FIIC, Senior Conservator\nThe finds from Sutton Hoo on display in Room 41.\nElizabeth Pye undertook ground-breaking work in the field of conservation. Following her archaeology degree at the University of Edinburgh, Elizabeth came to the Institute of Archaeology (IoA) in London at the end the 1960s to pursue further training and a career in the conservation of archaeological objects. She could not have foreseen at the time that her passion and knowledge would inspire so many people to become future conservators.\nShe started her career at the Museum, where one of her projects was working on the Sutton Hoo material together with colleagues. She trained students from all over the world, researched and published her work, and hugely contributed to the development of professional conservation. In 2015, she was presented the Conservation and Heritage Management Award by the Archaeological Institute of America.\nToday, many of her students are working in universities, museums, galleries and excavations across the world, training the next generation of conservators. I was very lucky to be one of her students, and followed her path to become an objects conservator at the Museum as well as working on various archaeological excavations with the knowledge and experience she passed down. I also had the opportunity to excavate and conserve side by side with her at the famous Neolithic site of Catalhoyuk in Turkey which is an experience I will never forget.\nThe queen of prints: Tatyana Grosman\nCatherine Daunt, Hamish Parker Curator of Modern and Contemporary Graphic Art\nTatyana Grosman in her studio on Islip Long Island \u00a9 1978 Lynn Gilbert.\nTatyana Grosman (1904\u20131982) was the founder of Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE), a hugely influential printmaking workshop based on Long Island, New York. Born in Russia, Grosman fled to the United States in 1943 with her husband Maurice, a painter, to escape antisemitism in Europe. For twelve years the couple lived in New York City where Tatyana played the role of \u2018artist\u2019s wife\u2019 until Maurice\u2019s ill-health instigated a move to West Islip, Long Island and required Tatyana to become the breadwinner.\nThere, she had the idea of setting up a studio where artists could make prints and collaborate with poets to produce artists\u2019 books. Although she knew little about printmaking, she was passionate and enterprising, and was able to start the workshop with a press purchased from a neighbour for 15 dollars, two lithographic stones that the couple had found in their yard, and the expertise of the printmaker Robert Blackburn. She was also successful in persuading young artists to come and work in the studio, despite the fact that some viewed printmaking as stale and old-fashioned. She enticed, among others, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Jim Dine, Cy Twombly and Helen Frankenthaler.\nBy introducing these artists to printmaking, and then publishing and distributing the results, Tatyana Grosman became a key figure in reviving printmaking in the United States and propelling it to new creative heights. The Museum holds impressions of some of the greatest prints produced at ULAE, including Two Maps II by Jasper Johns (1966), Accident by Robert Rauschenberg (1963), and Untitled (Hair) by Kiki Smith (1990). It is mostly the artists that we think of when we see these prints, but I always like to remember the woman behind the press, without whom, none of these amazing works of art would exist.\nJasper Johns (b. 1930), Two Maps II.

Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nInnovative designer: Margaret Hall\nAnn Lumley, Design and Brand Manager\nInside the 1972 Tutankhamun exhibition.\nMargaret Hall, OBE, RDI, was Head of Design at the British Museum and, over the course of 37 years, she led her team in designing countless exhibitions and galleries that engaged and informed millions of visitors each year.\nMargaret was appointed as Exhibitions Officer in 1964 \u2013 the first person employed by the Museum with the task of improving the design of displays, traditionally the sole remit of curators. She built up the in-house design department and oversaw the design of all the permanent galleries and special exhibitions. A highlight of her career was the 1972 Tutankhamun exhibition, which is rightly regarded as the first blockbuster archaeological exhibition, and became a benchmark for museum design. So significant was this achievement, Margaret was awarded an OBE for her role in the exhibition.\nMargaret was a pioneer of her time \u2013 she was the first in-house designer to establish best practice for museum design standards and a leading example across the sector. She did all of this as a woman in a very male-dominated world.\nI started work as a Graphic Designer in the Design Office of the British Museum in 1989, and after 32 years, I am now Design and Brand Manager. It was a great privilege to be part of Margaret\u2019s Design Office, to learn from her and to become a small part of the Museum\u2019s design legacy.\nPioneering archaeologist: Fayza Haikal\nAurelia Masson Berghoff, Naukratis Project Curator, Greece and Rome\nOne of the pages of the papyri of Nesmin that Fayza Haikal studied.\nIn the field of Egyptology, Fayza Haikal (b. 1938) has faced the combined challenge of being both a woman and an Egyptian, at a time when archaeology was dominated by European men. Fayza\u2019s father, an eminent politician and renowned scholar, wanted her to receive an international, secular education, so she attended, among others, the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais du Caire, the Faculty of Arts at Cairo University and Oxford University.\nBefore pursuing her graduate studies in England, in 1960 she participated in the UNESCO rescue mission in Lower Nubia (Egypt), documenting the hieroglyphic texts of monuments soon to be flooded by the construction of the High Dam in Aswan. At a time when Egyptian women were not allowed to leave their family\u2019s side, she had to employ finesse and determination to be able to travel and to be accepted alongside her male colleagues. In her own words, she \u2018opened the way to Nubia for female Egyptologists in Egypt\u2019.\nHer time in England in the early 1960s was formative and enjoyable as she experienced new degrees of freedom, although she still met a familiar resistance towards women in the world of archaeology. Despite her experience, when she asked to be included in the British mission in Nubia, , Prof. Emery, her then supervisor, turned her away, explaining he didn\u2019t \u2018take girls in [his] team\u2019. Decades later, I remember asking one of my professors if I could join an archaeological mission in Libya and receiving the same answer. Still, Fayza Haikal persevered and soon became the first Egyptian woman to hold a doctorate in Egyptology \u2013 her research focused on Egyptian papyri at the British Museum.\nFayza taught new generations of Egyptologists in Egypt and worldwide, and a number of her Egyptian students have gone on to hold prominent positions in museums, universities and the Ministry of State Antiquities. In 2015, her contribution was formally recognised with a nomination for \u2018Woman of the Year\u2019 from both the Egypt Exploration Society and the Ministry of Antiquities.\nThe science of colour: Ruth M. Johnston-Feller\nJoanne Dyer, Scientist\nImages reproduced by kind permission of Barbara Kammer.\nRuth Johnston-Feller (1923\u20132000), like me, was a colour scientist. She was one of the first to work with museum collections and her background was, in many ways, similar to mine. She spent the early years of her career conducting research in infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy as I did, but in the late 1950s she discovered that her real calling lay in the visible part of the spectrum \u2013 colour!\nIn her early career, Ruth was the first to use instrumental methods for formulating and controlling colour in paint and plastics manufacturing facilities. She then met her husband Robert L. Feller (Bob), who introduced her to art conservation research. From then on, Ruth devoted her attention to the measurement of colour and its appearance in art, and to studying fading in pigmented and dyed materials.\nRuth died in 2000 and although we never met, her pioneering spirit lived on through the inspiring conversations I had with her husband Bob who I met during my early career in the field. A true innovator, much of what we do in museums today would not have been possible without Ruth\u2019s ground-breaking work in the field of colour measurement, and her appreciation of how colour had the power to create and shape experience, something which I hold close to my own heart in my work at the Museum.\n\u201cA Chinese Bloomsburian\u201d: Ling Shuhua\nYu-Ping Luk, Curator, Chinese collections\nLing Shuhua. Image \u00a9 Creative Commons.\nAs an immigrant, I find it inspiring to learn more about Chinese women artists and intellectuals who came to live in Britain. Among them was the writer and painter Ling Shuhua (also known as Su Hua Ling Chen, 1900/4\u20131990) who moved to London in 1946, and remained in the city for the most part until 1989 when she returned to Beijing.\nLing and her husband Chen Yuan were part of the cosmopolitan cultural elite in China. Already a respected Chinese writer, Ling published her autobiography Ancient Melodies in English while in London, an endeavour initially encouraged by Virginia Woolf and later Vita Sackville-West. Her connection with the Bloomsbury Set started through Julian Bell, who was her lover when he visited China.\nLing had held exhibitions of her paintings in London, Paris and Boston. She lectured and published on Chinese art and literature. One of her Chinese articles, How do we look at Chinese paintings?, mentions the Admonitions scroll in the British Museum.\nLing was one of the important Chinese women who by their presence and activities generated interest and greater understanding of Chinese art and culture. It is a history that deserves to be more widely known.\nDetail of the Admonitions scroll \u2013 a handscroll painting illustrating the N\u00fcshi zhen (\u2018Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies\u2019).

Robertson\nEleanor Ghey, Curator, Coins & Medals\nSilver denarius, dating to 218\u2013222 AD, minted in Rome and found in Orpington, south-east England. One of the Roman coins Anne studied in the Museum collection.\nAlthough I never met her, I feel I owe a great debt to the numismatist (coin expert) and archaeologist Anne S. Robertson (1910\u20131997) for her work on Roman coin hoards found in Britain. Her catalogue of hoards, An Inventory of Romano-British Coin Hoards, published after her death in 2000, represents her lifetime\u2019s research carried out alongside excavation, teaching and research at the Hunterian Museum and the University of Glasgow.\nIn an era when newspapers and journals are increasingly available online, it is easy to forget the huge amount of work that gathering this information involved. Her exhaustive study provided the foundation for new research into the growing number of finds that have come to light since its publication.\nThe number of women in numismatics is growing, but we are still in a minority. For centuries, the discipline was the preserve of collectors, who shared their collections and knowledge via networks that were not accessible to all.\nRobertson was also pioneering in her interest in the archaeological context of coins, something that had previously been neglected. She combined museum work with practical archaeology and excavated many important Roman sites in Scotland throughout a long career, eventually being made Professor of Roman Archaeology at the University of Glasgow."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/top-10-historical-board-games/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "Top 10 historical board games", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2021-02-26 00:00:00", "text": "If you\u2019re feeling the need to step away from the screen, here are 10 historical board games from the collection \u2013 some of which you can still play today.

Carved walrus ivory and whales\u2019 teeth, found on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland, 1150\u20131175.\nThese charismatic chess pieces are the Lewis Chessmen \u2013 some of the most iconic objects in the Museum.\nMade in Scandinavia in the late 12th century, the skilfully carved chess pieces were found on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland around 1831.\nIt\u2019s thought they belonged to a merchant travelling from Norway to Ireland, and various stories have emerged to explain why they may have been concealed there.\nThe chessmen are strongly influenced by Norse culture. This is most evident in the figures of the warders or rooks which take the form of berserkers \u2013 fierce mythical warriors.\n\u2018Check\u2019 out all our replica chess sets in our online shop here.\nHear how the Lewis Chessmen are linked to a certain boy wizard in this video:\n3. Wari\nWooden wari board, Sierra Leone.\nWari is a game of calculation and strategy played widely within West Africa and also popular elsewhere in the world \u2013 you might know it as mancala.\nThe aim of the game is to capture the seeds of your opponent, moving them from their six playing holes to your bank.\nThis game board was made in Sierra Leone and is notable for its elaborate sculptural base. It\u2019s decorated with an animal, possibly a pig.\nIf you don\u2019t have a game board at home, you can play by drawing two rows of six circles on a piece of paper, with an oval at each end, and use 48 marbles, beads, pebbles, or even sweets as your counters.\nFind out how to play with a blog from the spruce crafts here (external link).\n4. Senet\nIvory game-box for senet. Egypt, 1400\u20131200BC.\nBeloved by Tutankhamun and Queen Nefertari alike, senet is one of the earliest known board games, dating to around 3100 BC.\nThe game board comprises 30 squares, laid out in three rows of 10. Two players compete to race all their pieces to the end of the board, using casting sticks or bones, rather than dice, to determine the number of squares moved with each throw.\nIvory game-box for senet. Egypt, 1400\u20131200 BC.\nSome boards, like this one made from a hollowed-out piece of wood faced with ivory, have completely blank squares, whereas others include squares decorated with hieroglyphs representing additional game rules.\nOn this papyrus, dating to around 1250\u20131150 BC, a lion plays senet with a gazelle, despite having a bit of trouble holding the pieces.\nPapyrus with satirical vignettes. Deir el-Medina (Thebes), 1250\u20131150 BC.\n5. Mahjong\nSet of mahjong tiles made of bone, bamboo, pigment. China, 1800\u20131900.\nFirst played during the Qing dynasty in China (1644\u20131912), mahjong is a strategy based game played using tiles. They are traditionally decorated with Chinese characters, bamboo branches and dots, and special tiles are indicated with winds, dragons, flowers and seasons. This incomplete set has 140 of the original 144 tiles, which are made from bamboo and bone \u2013 each tile weighs just six grams.\nIt is similar in practice to the card game rummy, and four players draw and discard tiles to complete their hand. The aim of the game is to get all 14 of your tiles into four sets and one pair.\nMahjong was introduced to the West in the 19th century, and has grown in popularity internationally since. You can find an exquisitely-made mahjong set in our online shop here, and master the game for yourself.\n6. The Game of the Goose\n\u2018The Royal and Entertaining Game of the Goose\u2019. Hand-coloured etching, varnished, framed and backed with green baize. Glasgow, 1800\u20131820.\nThe earliest commercially produced board game, the Game of the Goose is a game of chance and luck, involving no strategy at all.\nDuke Francesco de Medici first gifted the game, then called Gioco dell\u2019Oca to Philip II of Spain between 1574 and 1587, and the pastime quickly spread in popularity throughout Europe. These examples dating from 1774 to the late 19th century include the rules in French, German and Italian.\nFrench, German and Italian versions of the \u2018Game of the Goose\u2019\nThe aim of the game is to get your counter to the centre of the board, moving counterclockwise according to rolls of a die. Some spaces are accompanied by special rules \u2013 for example, if you land on number 58 you must start the game again, or if you land on number 19 you might pay a forfeit and drink until your next turn. Players must score a perfect 63 to win the game.\nTo play \u2018Game of the Goose\u2019 at home, simply copy or print out any of the versions linked in the captions above, which handily hold all the rules on the board, find two dice, and enjoy!\n7. Ajax and Achilles\u2019 game of dice\nA black-figure amphora showing Ajax and Achilles playing a game. The Lysippides Painter, Attica (Greece), around 530 BC.\nMade in Athens around 530 BC, this amphora shows Ajax and Achilles \u2013 two of the heroes of the Trojan war \u2013 playing a board game, possibly with pessi, or dice.\nSeven counters or dice are visible on the game board, and Ajax reaches out to pick up one of his pieces for the next throw, as they pass the hours between the fighting.\nWe can\u2019t be sure what game they were playing, or how the dice were scored, but an equivalent might be backgammon, which involves both counters and dice. It dates back nearly 5,000 years to Mesopotamia, and versions were played in the Byzantine Empire in 5th-century and in 6th-century Persia.\nHear from curator Irving Finkel about the history of board games \u2013 including chess and backgammon \u2013 in this audio clip.\nCurator Victoria Donnellan invites us into the world of Ajax and Achilles\u2019 game in this video:\n8. Sugoroku\nNew Board Game of the Four Ranks (Shi-n\u014d-k\u014d-sh\u014d shin sugoroku. Woodblock print, Japan, 18th century.\nFirst brought to Japan from China in the 8th century, sugoroku was originally a complex game played by two people with a pair of dice and fifteen counters each, popular among the Japanese elite.\nAffordable woodblock-printed sugoroku sheets were developed in the Edo period (1615\u20131868), meaning this form of the game \u2013 e-sugoroku \u2013 meaning \u2018picture sugoroku\u2019, could be played widely. It is similar in style to western snakes and ladders, and this 18th-century example uses the hierarchical status system, from merchant to artisan, farmer and warrior in ascending order.\nIt can be played by two or more people, who advance their pieces according to dice rolls around a clockwise spiral. Each player starts at the \u2018merchant\u2019 square, in the bottom right-hand corner, and the goal is to reach the largest square in the centre \u2013 \u2018daimyo lord\u2019s first arrow shooting of the year\u2019, with a picture of a samurai drawing his bow in the presence of high-ranking courtiers.\nEach square is illustrated with a different occupation, including fishmongers, pharmacists, plasterers, priests, doctors and scholars. Print the game out and play it for yourself to see if you can spot them all \u2013 you\u2019ll just need dice and some counters to get started.\n9. Pachisi\n(Left) A beadwork gaming board for pachisi, north west India, 1850\u20131900, (Right) A cotton and velvet game board for pachisi, Sri Lanka, 19th century\nPachisi is an Indian game played since at least the 16th century on a board shaped like a symmetrical cross. The aim of the game is to move all four of your pieces around the board before your opponents do, with the central square acting as the start and finish point.\nThe number of spaces moved on each turn is determined by a throw, traditionally of cowrie shells, and the number of shells which land with their opening upwards dictates the number of spaces moved. In other iterations of the game, shells are replaced by beehive-shaped pieces, like these below.\n12 pachisi pieces made of crystal. Assam, India, 19th century\nThe name of the game is derived from the Hindi word pacc\u012bs, meaning twenty-five \u2013 the largest score possible with one throw, where none of the pieces land upside down, and so the game is also known as Twenty Five.\nThe principles of pachisi were taken to create Ludo \u2013 a simplified version of the same game \u2013 in England in 1896.

Egypt, Early Dynastic period (around 2925\u20132575 BC).\nNamed after the Egyptian snake god, Mehen was played from around 3000 BC until 2300 BC.\nThe game board is in the shape of a coiled snake, whose body is divided up into rectangular segments, and teams of up to six players race from the tail to the head and back again, with additional lion-shaped gaming pieces.\nThe rules and scoring system of Mehen are unknown, but a modern equivalent might be Hyena \u2013 a North African game where players race a mother piece along a spiral track from the outside (the village), to the centre (the well), and back. The first to finish wins and releases a hyena, which also travels along the spiral, eating other players\u2019 pieces as it goes!\nWe hope you enjoyed our rundown of some historic board games \u2013 let us know if they\u2019ve cured your boredom and if you\u2019re enjoying playing any by tweeting us @britishmuseum.\nFind more great games and perplexing puzzles to challenge your mind in our online shop here."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/whats-it-like-being-a-woman-working-in-the-arts/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "What's it like being a woman working in the arts?", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2021-02-24 00:00:00", "text": "Sushma Jansari, the Tabor Foundation Curator: South Asia\nTell us about your job \u2013 what\u2019s a typical day like for you?\nNo two days are alike, which is how I like it! I could be doing anything from cataloguing a collection to working on an exhibition, writing an article, taking part in a workshop or interviewing colleagues for the British Museum Podcast with my co-presenter Hugo Chapman (Keeper of Prints and Drawings) and producer Sian Toogood.\nSushma with fellow curator and podcast presenter Hugo.\nHow did you get here?\nIt has been a challenge. To cut a long story short, I volunteered at different museums while studying for my degree and PhD. Eventually, having gained a lot of invaluable experience working with collections and publishing my research, I spent six years on a series of temporary contracts working on a variety of exciting projects, and finally, in 2019, got a permanent curatorial job.\nWhat\u2019s your favourite part of the job?\nI love working with people across the museum and beyond it. The focus of our work and discussions are objects and the manifold, interconnected stories that swirl around them. It is unravelling these stories and sharing them with the wider public that excites me.\nWhat\u2019s your favourite object in the collection?\nA small bronze sculpture of the female Bodhisattva Tara sitting in lalitasana, the position of royal ease. The figure is from Sri Lanka, dates to the seventh or eighth century and still bears traces of the gilding that originally covered the whole sculpture. Over the years, I have spent many quiet moments meditating on this figure.\nBronze sculpture of the goddess Tara. Sri Lanka, 7th or 8th century AD.\nDo you think women and men face different challenges in your area of work?\nYou know, I haven\u2019t really thought about the challenges that men face at work, but it is probably something I should think about more carefully. Women still earn less than men for doing the same work, including in the museum sector, and this needs to be addressed, challenged and rectified.\nWhat changes would you like to see for women\u2019s careers in the arts?\nGradually, I\u2019m seeing a lot more women employed in a much wider range of roles across the arts sector and also reaching the most senior positions in arts organisations. This is a very welcome change and a trend that I hope continues.\nIn terms of changes I would like to see, a practical one would be much more flexibility in how we work. It has been clear for a long time that, thanks to technological advances, we do not need to be tied solely to desks in offices, for example. Working practices have had to change radically because of the covid-related regulations and, while there are unquestionably some downsides to this, there are also benefits. I hope we maintain the positive aspects of these changes, including more working from home, in the longer term. This is because, for me, this single change has had a profound impact on my life and work, in terms of sheer productivity as well as mental and physical wellbeing, and on my family life.\nWhat would be your advice to someone aiming for a career in museums and galleries?\nBe realistic. Yes, it is an exciting sector to work in, but the wages are very low and, increasingly, the jobs \u2013 where they are available at all \u2013 tend to be temporary contracts. It is a question I am asked a lot, so I wrote a blogpost for people who are considering curatorial jobs.\nWhat question do you wish people would stop asking about your job?\nSo many people ask me what objects we have secretly hidden in the stores. We don\u2019t \u2018hide\u2019 objects! They are all catalogued and freely available either on Collection online or to view in galleries, exhibitions and in person in our study rooms.\nSophie Rowe,\u00a0Conservator: Organics\nSophie working in the organic materials conservation studio.\nTell us about your job \u2013 what\u2019s a typical day like for you?\nI work as a conservator in the Museum\u2019s organic materials conservation studio. My work focuses on the collections we have from Africa, Oceania and the Americas. The great thing about my job is that there isn\u2019t really a \u2018typical\u2019 day. I could be working in the lab to clean and repair a giant Alaskan sail made out of walrus intestine in the morning, meeting with visitors from Tahiti in our stores to examine and talk about objects in the afternoon and then in the evening I could be 12 metres up in the air in a cherry picker, wearing a hard-hat and cleaning the Haida totem pole in the Great Court.\nHow did you get here?\nI\u2019ve always been a museum and history nerd. When I was younger, I was obsessed with the film The Mummy (1999) and wanted to be an Egyptologist just like Rachel Weisz. When I was 16 went on a day-tour around the Institute of Archaeology at University College London (UCL). That included a visit to the student conservation labs (they teach conservation there as a Master\u2019s degree.) I remember a student working on a mummified ibis (a bird) from ancient Egypt and I just couldn\u2019t believe she got to touch it and fix it, and that doing that could be a job. I wanted to do that!\nAfter studying Egyptology at Liverpool University, along with History and Archaeology, I saved up to do the Master\u2019s in Conservation at UCL, got in, and found myself in the very same lab I\u2019d visited as a 16-year-old. After I graduated, I worked at National Museums Scotland for a bit, and then a contract came up at the British Museum. I\u2019ve been here ever since. And last year I worked on a mummified crocodile, so dreams can come true.\nRachel Weisz in The Mummy (1999).\nWhat\u2019s your favourite part of the job?\nI get a lot of satisfaction from being close to cultural heritage and the history of people. I am really privileged to get to see objects from the collection up-close in a way that many people don\u2019t. The work that I do often means that objects can go on display, travel on loan, or be touched and handled by visiting community groups, when they might not have been able to before. Knowing that the work I do can facilitate people experiencing the collection, and that that contact with objects and their histories can have a huge impact on people is really special.\nWhat\u2019s your favourite object in the collection?\nCan I have two? The first is the gut parka normally on display in Room 24, made by Mrs Flora Nanuk, a Yup\u2019ik seamstress. We a have a few parkas like this in the collection. These amazing wind and waterproof parkas are from the Arctic regions and are made from intestines (normally of seals) which have been cleaned, inflated and allowed to dry. This creates a thin but really strong material which can be sewn together to make clothing, sails and windows among many other things. It is wonderful that people can make something so useful and beautiful out of a part of the animal that many people wouldn\u2019t think twice about throwing away. In the Arctic, respect of the animal you kill and ensuring you don\u2019t waste resources is really important.\nFlora Nanuk (1925\u20132004, Yupiit), women\u2019s gut parka. Bearded seal gut and colon, beach grass. Hooper Bay, Alaska, USA, 1980s.\nThe second object is a piece of bread from ancient Egypt \u2013 once an ancient Egypt nerd, always an ancient Egypt nerd. It doesn\u2019t look very tasty, but what makes this object really special to me is the fact that you can see the handprint of the baker who made it. This just seems so real, and so human. Seeing the handprint of someone who was living and making bread 3,000 years ago blows my mind. Not to mention that it is amazing that the bread itself has survived for so long.\nTwo loaves of unleavened bread. Egypt, New Kingdom.\nDo you think women and men face different challenges in your area of work?\nInterestingly, conservation was seen in the past as a technician role and was full of men in brown lab coats fixing things. These days it\u2019s a female-dominated profession, though that might not be entirely for positive reasons. Some people put it down to the fact that it is not that well paid for the amount of time spent training, and as a rule there aren\u2019t that many conservators who go on to take up top leadership positions, which men might gravitate more towards \u2013 although our Head of Collection Care, Sandra Smith, was a conservator by training and has gone on to take up a top role, which is fab.\n\nWhat changes would you like to see for women\u2019s careers in the arts?\nAcross museums and the arts, low-pay, poor job security, contract work, fear of skills loss during time-off (for example maternity leave) and a lack of female role-models at director or deputy director level all have an impact on how women see themselves in the workplace and what opportunities seem more open. Something I see as particularly challenging for women are the issues around combining career with family life. Currently the only way upwards in a role is via management (which often demands full-time working patterns). I think more flexible working opportunities and pathways to the top are really needed, and it would be great if there was more recognition of skills other than management, such as expertise built up over a number of years.\nWhat would be your advice to someone aiming for a career in museums and galleries?\nDo your research, see what kind of job you would like to do and then get in touch with someone who does it to talk to them about it, maybe even visit their work. It\u2019s good to make friends and contacts so you have a network of people who can support and advise you. If you are a young person, there are some great schemes which connect young people with tutors in the arts and heritage sector, for example check out Arts Emergency.\nOften you need to have a university degree and to have done (normally unpaid) volunteer work to get the experience employers are looking for. This needs to change, as it really limits who can enter the profession. But talking to people and being passionate is a great place to start.\nTell us about the women who inspire you.\nAside from Rachel Weisz you mean? Well, at the Museum \u00a0I\u2019ve met so many strong, smart and open women who have come to the museum to visit the collection and are actively involved in projects which advocate to preserve the knowledge and crafts of their ancestors, and which promote the sharing of that with others. I\u2019m always in awe of the passion of many of these women.\nWhat question do you wish people would stop asking about your job?\n\u2018Have you ever broken anything?\u2019\u00a0This is a really uncomfortable question to ask someone who works as a conservator and whose main aim is to look after objects. But yes, I have. When you handle delicate objects every day, even with all the skills and training we have, it\u2019s likely, though very unfortunate, that something will eventually happen. Obviously, it is heart-breaking, but accidents do happen, and at least as a conservator I am in the best position to be able to fix it.\nAkiko Yano, Mitsubishi Corporation Curator, Japanese Section, Department of Asia\nTell us about your job \u2013 what\u2019s a typical day like for you?\nI\u2019m a curator of the Japanese collections. Each day can be quite different except that there are always a lot of email reading and writing. On a quiet day, I try to stay in the store and examine collection objects for my research and collection management. On a busy day, I often meet and take care of visitors \u2013 researchers, students and other groups, diplomatic delegations, benefactors, etc.\nHow did you get here?\nI studied Japanese art history, with emphasis on late medieval to early-modern paintings, up to my doctorate in Japan. My first real encounter with Britain was the year in London when I got a scholarship from the Sainsbury Institute for the Study of Japanese Arts and Cultures (SISJAC) as a PhD student. I found London fascinating. I was a post-doctoral research fellow at SOAS University of London before joining the British Museum.\nIt may sound as if it were smooth sailing. But it was more like I somehow drifted along various currents in my post-doc period and finally landed ashore at the British Museum. Moving from my native country to a foreign one must have been a huge decision for me to make but I don\u2019t remember a particular point when I made the choice \u2013 rather it was a gradual process in pursuit of my life and career\nWhat\u2019s your favourite part of the job?\nHandling collection objects. I like to be in direct contact with the physicality and materiality of objects. I enjoy detailed visual observation. Finding unrecorded features and including them in the cross-museum database for future reference (it might be useful in decades\u2019 time) is quite fulfilling.\nYamamoto Akane (1977\u2013present), Leaf Boat. Coloured glass and gold leaf, 2019.\nCourtesy of Adrian Sassoon, London.\nWhat\u2019s your favourite object in the collection?\nThere are so many in different ways. But I would select for the \u2018women\u2019s history\u2019 theme the recently acquired\u00a0Leaf Boat, an incredibly beautiful glass sculpture made in 2019 by a contemporary Japanese female artist Yamamoto Akane. Her combination of medium and techniques is unusual and delicate as she sandwiches intricate gold leaf patterns between pieces of glass, which is extremely difficult to achieve in perfection. She draws inspiration from reading\u00a0The Tale of Genji, the voluminous novel of courtly romance written by a female author of c. 1000 AD Japan, Murasaki Shikibu. Yamamoto\u2019s work can be termed a deep female sensitivity translated into contemporary form and aesthetics.\nWhat\u2019s your hidden gem in the Museum?\nIt is by no means hidden (on permanent display), but I always admire the tiny porcelain \u2018chicken cup\u2019 from 15th century Ming China, in the Percival David Gallery. It depicts on the outside a delightful scene of a family of cock, hen and chicks by the rock and flowers in a colourful and gentle palette. Despite its earthy adorable subject, it appears extremely delicate and sophisticated as a whole.\nPorcelain wine cup. Jiangxi, China, 1465\u20131487.\nDo you think women and men face different challenges in your area of work?\nI understand that the male-female ratio in the curatorial area is weighing more towards females. In the nature of our work, I do not see much difference for men or women. However, people tend to assume that my boss is a man. Is it because the British Museum has a masculine image, perhaps?\nStephanie Vasiliou, Assistant Collection Manager: Heavy Objects\nTell us about your job \u2013 what\u2019s a typical day like for you?\nI work as a heavy object handler \u2013 affectionately referred to as a \u2018Heavy\u2019 among colleagues and friends \u2013 and my team is responsible for the safe handling, movement, display and packing of large, heavy and awkward objects across the Museum\u2019s collection. I also work on loans, so I get to travel across the county and the world, transporting and installing British Museum objects at other heritage institutions. I may spend one day packing Assyrian reliefs for international loans and the next day installing the Crouching Venus (on long-term loan for the Royal Collection Trust) following a gallery refurbishment. Or I could be sat in a truck for five days travelling across Europe couriering objects to The State Hermitage Museum in Russia, or sitting in the cockpit of a cargo plane during take-off, having just overseen the palletising and loading of crates into the hold.\nHow did you get here?\nGrowing up, history was always my favourite subject \u2013 shocking for someone who works in a museum I know! \u2013 \u00a0so I chose to study archaeology at university. \u00a0Being a Rachel Weisz fan I was disappointed to find running from reanimated mummies took up considerably less of the course than I had been led to believe, and unlike Raiders of the Lost Ark there weren\u2019t any lecturers that inspired me to write on my eyelids. But I did discover that I loved interacting with tangible history through the study and examination of objects.\nThis led me to a Masters in Conservation at UCL, during which I secured an internship in the Stone, Wall Paintings and Mosaics conservation studio at the British Museum. From that point on I wanted to be a stone conservator, having fallen in love with the artform and material. After two and half years working in stone conservation my contract came to an end and a position in the Heavies was advertised \u2013 it seemed like a great opportunity to learn new skills relating to the material and objects that I so loved working with.\nWhat\u2019s the hardest part of your role?\nHandling the objects. A lot of what we do involves equipment and machinery, but often we have to move objects into place by hand, and when you\u2019re working with a few tonnes, that isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s quite an interesting combination, the need to be careful and delicate when handling objects of the scale and size that I do. Avoiding scuffing freshly painted plinths (platforms on which objects are displayed) is the bane of my professional life! In a broader sense, the ACM role is quite a low paid job that offers little in the way of job progression, and many people come to this role from similar backgrounds to myself. Many of us are here because we enjoy the work and care about the collection, and it can be very difficult to reconcile that with the low pay and limited opportunities for upward progression.\nWhat\u2019s your favourite object in the collection?\nIt\u2019s hard to pick a favourite! I\u2019ve been able to work with so many amazing objects over the years and you become quite attached. But, if I absolutely must, then I would say that the Nereid Monument in Gallery 17 is particularly special (is choosing a whole monument cheating?)\nOne thing I find truly remarkable about stone sculpture, and marble in particular, is how it can be made to look soft. The fluidity captured in the Chitons (tunics) worn by the sea goddesses is beautiful, demonstrating graceful movement and suppleness in a way that\u2019s dynamic and real. The contrast between this and the rigid grandeur of the temple structure so perfectly encapsulates the versatility of this material and the artistry and craftsmanship involved in its manipulation.\nThe Nereid Monument, Xanthos, Turkey, 390\u2013380 BC.\nDo you think women and men face different challenges in your area of work?\nUnfortunately, I do. My role, and roles like mine, have traditionally been very male-dominated \u2013 highlighted by the fact that I was, until recently, the only woman in my team, and only the fourth to hold this position in the role\u2019s history. I have found myself having to battle to be heard above my male counterparts. There have definitely been occasions when people have deferred authority to my male colleagues, seeking advice, guidance or permission from them, despite me being the leading object handler on the project. My colleagues are hugely experienced and great at what they do but it can be very disheartening to have to constantly assert your authority, just so the advice and expertise you have spent years developing can be respected and taken seriously. Thankfully, I work with a lovely team, who often try to steer these conversations back to me, which is a small, but valuable step, in dismantling the preconceived ideas of what someone who does my job looks like.\nWhat changes would you like to see for women\u2019s careers in the arts?\nUltimately, I would like to see better representation of women in the more senior positions, for example on the Board of Trustees, in the Directorate and senior management. While a number of management positions within the Museum are held by women \u2013 Head of Collection Care, Head of Exhibitions, Head of Collection Management to name a few \u2013 there still seems to be a lack of female leaders in the top most positions, not just within the Museum, but across the sector as a whole.\nWhat\u2019s something you\u2019ve always wanted to tell people about your job, but nobody thinks to ask about?\nI guess I would want to tell people that lifting large, heavy objects isn\u2019t a \u2018boys\u2019 game\u2019, as there can be a lot of stereotyping surrounding my job, which not only does a disservice to me as a woman, but also to my male colleagues, who can be reduced to archetypal \u2018strongmen\u2019. There\u2019s a great deal of planning that goes into lifting and moving the types of objects that we handle, often involving specialist equipment, requiring training and expertise that we all work hard to complete and develop.\nTell us about the women who inspire you.\nI am inspired by women daily, from activists to authors and politicians \u2013 the list is endless. However, as I\u2019ve got older, I find myself \u00a0most inspired by the women around me. My colleagues who balance their professional careers with parenting and do both with total commitment and dedication.

Kristy Berington drives a dog team across the boreal forest in preparation for the Iditarod, a famous Alaskan dog=sledding race.\nFrom wolves to working partners\nArctic Peoples have had dogs for a very long time. In fact, archaeological excavations show canine presence in the Arctic for at least 17,000 years! The general theory is that wolves came closer to human settlements to benefit from being near humans, eating scraps of food they had left. These wolves eventually became domesticated dogs. Humans too realised that these wolf-dogs were useful for different purposes.\nAs early as 9,000 years ago, Arctic ancestors living in northern Siberia \u2013 what is now Zhokov Island \u2013 made sleds that could be pulled by dogs. The Zhokov hunters, who were specialised polar bear hunters, bred larger dogs for hunting polar bear while smaller dogs were used for early forms of transport.\nThe skull of an old dog missing most of its teeth.

We know that 1,500 years ago, dogs were important companions in the Iputiak culture (roughly AD 250\u2013800), who lived along the eastern Chukchi Sea coastline. While there is still uncertainty about the exact role of dogs, Iputiak graveyards show reverence for them as they were buried with humans. The Old Bering Sea culture (AD 250\u20131400) also kept dogs for ceremonial purposes and food. At this stage, however, dogs were not used for transport in North America.\nWalrus tusk, engraved with scenes of umiaks, kayaks and homes being pulled across the ice. Angowzhuk, Happy Jack. Early 1900s.\nClose up of the engraving showing dogs pulling sleds.\nDogs\u2019 roles changed significantly with the Thule peoples\u2019 expansion (1200\u20131400) across the American Arctic. Dogs enabled the rapid transcontinental movement of Inuit from Chukotka towards Greenland. The Thule people, ancestors of the Inuit, perfected dog traction (use of dog harnesses and sled hitches) which allowed for larger dog teams to haul heavier sleds.\nThe Thule people were expert sea mammal hunters and the availability of vast quantities of highly nutritious food enabled larger dog teams to flourish. Technological innovation, such as using sled-hitching technologies for dog sleds made larger dog teams possible while the use of whips transformed human attitudes towards dogs. Companions became work partners.\nDog whip made of leather; whip with handle carved of wood and whip made of heavy strips of leather. Hudson Bay, Canada.

One dog is at the front and the other six dogs are in pairs behind. The driver of dogs appears to have a stick to direct the dogs.\nIvory model of a dog sled. Mid 19th century. Russia.\nAnother style of hitching dogs is used by Inuit in eastern Canada and Greenland. The so-called \u2018fan hitch\u2019 spreads out dogs and runs in a line like this model from Hudson\u2019s Bay, Canada shows. This style of hitching sled dogs is preferred as it is safer to have a wide spread of dogs when travelling across sea ice.\u00a0The dogs also have more room to maneuver across rough patches of ice.\nModel sledge made of wood, ivory and whalebone showing the fan hitch.

Dogs were just used for everything to make a living. Those days, if you didn\u2019t have a dog team you were considered to be poor. People with dog teams were considered well off.\u2019\nPostcard showing a dog team pulling a sled. Alberta, Canada. Around 1920.\n\u2018Usually in a dog team we have five to seven dogs. Seven Husky dogs makes a strong dog team. These dogs have long hair because of the cold weather, \u2013 their hair grows long and they stand about 2 to 2.5 feet (60 \u201375cm). The dogs had broad shoulders and they are really strong and powerful. When we have them in a team we use a harness in a straight line \u2013 one after another. We have a lead dog that listens to every command that you are giving. Those days we relied on them because wherever you went they would bring you home regardless. It happened to me once. I came down from Stoney Creek and I was beat tired and I just let them go. Pretty soon I was back in Fort McPherson. That time I said: \u2018Oh man, no matter what I do, these dogs bring me home\u2019. They did too. I always have respect for dogs, they are pretty smart animals.\u2019\nDogs for hunting\nDogs are not only used for travelling \u2013 they\u2019re also very important for traditional activities such as hunting. Reflecting on his memories as an Inuk hunter, the artist Parr illustrates events he experienced. In this drawing, Hunters, Dogs, and Walrus, he animates a walrus and polar bear hunt. The two hunters are accompanied by a dog that appears to be chasing a polar bear.\nParr, Hunters, Dogs and Walrus, 1966. Drawing on paper.\nParr, Harpooning Walrus, 1962. Engraving.\nGwich\u2019in people also used dogs while hunting. Abraham Stewart Junior recollects a hunting trip with a renowned Gwich\u2019in Chief:\n\u2018Way back in the 1970s, I went out hunting with Chief Johnny Charlie and his son Alfred. We walked up in the mountains to Timber Creek and Chief Johnny took his dogs carrying a pack over their backs. We shot a couple of caribous (wild reindeers) and the Chief cut up the caribou and even took out the bones. He then loaded the same weight of meat on each side of the dog-pack. They are laying there and he knows how to work with them. When it is time to go and the dogs stood up, they rolled right over. About two or three times this happened but then they knew how to carry a pack. They learn very fast, they tumbled over a couple of times but that is it. They got their balance after a little while and pretty soon they were running ahead of us with a big load of meat. It doesn\u2019t take too long for a dog to know what is going on.\u2019\nCarving of a caribou by George Flowers. Wood and bone. 1992. Labrador, Canada.\nDogs as companions\nDogs are not only used for hunting, they are important companions on the land or ice. They have been invaluable for S\u00e1mi peoples, accompanying them when reindeer-herding.\nDogs also accompany hunters during ice-fishing trips as Andrew Qappik\u2019s drawing There is Another One vividly illustrates. The dog watches how the woman catches fish \u2013 fish that will also feed the dog.\nAndrew Qappik, There\u2019s Another One, 2012. Coloured stencil drawing. \u00a9 Andrew Qappik.\nThe dogs are also important guardians. They protect against bears or wolves and there are numerous Arctic Indigenous Peoples\u2019 stories where the dogs guard against sickness or evil spirits.\nAn Inuit woman with her dog, Baffin Island. Around 1901\u20131913. Photographed by: Rev Edgar W T Greenshield.\nDogs in a time of climate change\nMany Arctic Indigenous People now rely on snowmobiles for travelling and hunting, rather than dogs. However, as climate change has an increasingly profound impact on life in the Arctic, some Arctic Peoples are considering moving back to more traditional forms of transport. I would like to end this blog with Abraham Stewart Junior and his son Richard. During a conversation for this blog, I asked them about the importance of having a dog team in this era of climate change.\nSnow-mobile on display in the Citi exhibition: Arctic: culture and climate. Plastic, metal, caribou skin. Canada. Around 1985.\nAbraham said:\n\u2018We can use [a] dog team to go out on the land to get wood, to hunt caribou, to go fishing. We use [a] dog team for everything. That is one of the reasons to start [a] dog team again. We have one dog who we will get pups from. My son Richard is very interested in driving [a] dog team.\u2019\nPhotograph of Abe Stewart with his old dog team in 2000 before leaving to attempt to travel for over 200 kilometers across the mountains to Old Crow. \u00a9 Abraham Stewart.\n\u2018The last time I had [a] dog team was 1980, then I went to work and from that time on we started to have this global warming. I remember that. I am still living out on the land and the way things way are going globally it sure don\u2019t look too healthy for me. Not only me but some Old People talk about [it]. They say, \u2018hard times are coming again\u2019. Even way back in the 1960s-70s, I remember our Elders telling us that \u2018some day you guys are going to have [a] hard time, you young people\u2019. That is something which is happening now. So I talk to my boys about stuff like that and tell them that we need to go back and try getting a dog team again because it will not be easy to find gas for snowmobiles or trucks.\u2019\nTwo members of Abraham\u2019s previous dog team. Photograph Peter Loovers. \u00a9 ERC Arctic Domus.\n\u2018From the 1980s back, I never saw any change in the weather. I remember because May 1980 was the last time I went out on the land with an Elder and everything [was] normal according to the weather \u2013 normal. Right from [the] start of summer, in July, we go out on the land and start fishing in order to make dry fish for the winter to feed the dogs. The weather is just the right weather, it is not too hot nor too cold to dry fish. It rains whenever it has to rain, the sun shines when it has to shine. Then into the fall (autumn), the lakes and rivers start freezing up by mid-September with ice. All that time we are fishing. But now due to global warming, it only starts freezing up late September into October and then there is still a lot of water. In December there are still small creeks that are running with water. The warmer weather also affects fishing. When I caught fish it would immediately freeze and so it does not spoil. But now, when I am fishing for dogs for the winter [food], the fish just get spoilt and I have to throw them away. It is too warm.\u2019\nAbraham with his old dog Snowball. Photograph Peter Loovers. \u00a9 ERC Arctic Domus.\n\u2018These are big changes, also when it comes to teaching my children. When I am out on the land I need to know whether the ice is safe or when to hunt. The fish and caribou, too are all on different time \u2013 in a different time zone now. It is hard to teach anybody about safety on the land because so much has changed globally.\u2019\nPhotograph showing Richard using a dog team to pull a sled carrying wood. \u00a9 Abraham Stewart.\nRichard agrees and told me:\n\u2018With all these changes, and the things my father is telling me, I would not mind having a dog team. One time I went for wood with a snowmobile and I broke down. We had a couple of pups from one of my dad\u2019s dogs at my dad\u2019s cabin. I walked back to our cabin and hooked up those pups to [the] dog sled with [an] old-time harness and they pulled that wood out. That is what my father means by \u2018relying on\u2019. I always listen to my Elders when they talk about their travels with dog teams. I guess you get to see more of the country than with [a] snowmobile. So I was always thinking about having a dog team too \u2013 I always wanted to.\nDogs, therefore, are much more than man\u2019s best friend \u2013 in the Arctic, they are life.\nExplore more content related to the Citi exhibition Arctic: culture and climate here.\nOur special thanks to Abraham Stewart Junior and Richard for sharing their experience of working with dogs in the Arctic.\nBuy your copy of the beautifully illustrated book accompanying the exhibition, named one of the books of the year by the Times, here.\nLead supporter Citi\nSupported by\nJulie and Stephen Fitzgerald\nAKO Foundation"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/reflections-contemporary-art-of-the-middle-east-and-north-africa/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Reflections: contemporary art of the Middle East and North Africa", "author": "Venetia Porter, Curator of Islamic and contemporary Middle East art", "timestamp": "2021-02-11 00:00:00", "text": "If you want to understand more about the past and present of a country, there is no better place to start than contemporary art. The Middle East and North Africa saw the birth and flourishing of ancient civilisations and religions, literature, music and art. Yet in recent memory, there has also been revolution, conflict, the destruction of cultural heritage and mass migration that is still ongoing and remains one of the most troubling and defining features of our time. The stories behind the artworks in this display echo that great sweep of history, expressing reflections on the past and considering the relationship between past and present. While some artists allude to artistic or literary heritage, others speak of taboos, history and current politics and reflect on their own societies, all of which have experienced extraordinary changes in living memory.\nReflections: contemporary art of the Middle East and North Africa comprises over 100 works on paper from the British Museum\u2019s own collection: drawings, etchings, posters, photographs and artists\u2019 books, by artists who either live in the countries of their birth, or have left for a variety of reasons, including war and persecution. The Museum began collecting works on paper by artists from the Middle East and North Africa in the 1980s. In 2006, the museum showcased works from the collection in Word into Art and the success of this exhibition led to the formation of a patrons\u2019 group in 2009, known as CaMMEA (Contemporary and Modern Middle East Art) dedicated to expanding the collection. There are now about 300 artists from across the region represented in the British Museum collection.\nAs the collection has grown, I have become increasingly fascinated by the stories artists tell through the work they make. Collected through the prism of the British Museum as a museum of history, I see these works both as art as well as documents that speak of their time. This display invites you to delve deep into the worlds of the artists, and these are just some of the fascinating themes and works that visitors will discover.\nThe Figure\nPeople often think that within the cultures of Islam, the depiction of the human figure is completely forbidden. Although the Qur\u2019an opposes the worship of images, it does not reject representational art. The Prophet\u2019s hadiths (sayings), compiled a century after his death, provide evidence both in favour of and against figural imagery. Figural representation is never found in copies of the Qur\u2019an and other holy texts, nor in religious spaces such as mosques and shrines. However, the ban did not extend to non-religious contexts and there is a rich tradition of illustrating manuscripts such as the Persian Shahnama (Book of Kings) in which the figure is freely depicted. Nevertheless, across the centuries and in different countries and times, unease over figural representation has continued. For the first modern artists in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa) of the early 20th century, whose works are found in the first section of the display, it was not always possible to study the figure in their own countries as their contemporaries could in the art schools of Europe.\nThe first section of the display focuses on the different ways that artists use the figure from the early 20th century, when art schools were being established across the region, up to the present day. Among the early works are those by artists sent on scholarships to study at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris or the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome. There, away from the conservatism of home, they would learn life drawing alongside landscape and perspective and were also exposed to European art movements.\n(1) Michel Basbous (1921-1981), Untitled. Charcoal on paper, 1958\u201362. Funded by CaMMEA.\n\u00a9 Estate of the artist.\nThe sculptor Michel Basbous (1921-1981) had begun his studies at the Acad\u00e9mie Libanaise des Beaux-Arts in Beirut and went from there to the Beaux Arts in Paris in 1949. During a second stay, in 1954, he joined the studio of the Russian artist and sculptor Ossip Zadkine (1888\u20131967). Basbous\u2019s drawings (1) were often sketches that would be transformed into glorious sculptures. Figurative as well as abstract, these fill the garden (2) of his house in the village of Rachana, which he turned into an open-air museum and artistic and cultural centre which flourished in the years before the Civil War that engulfed Lebanon between 1975 and 1990. I was fortunate enough to have visited Rachana some years ago and was amazed at the beautiful white sculptures that began to appear on the main road as we neared the village.\n(2) The garden at Rachana. Photo courtesy of Anachar Basbous.\nFor Syrian artist Fadi Yazigi (born 1966), although like Basbous a painter and a sculptor, his figures are from another time and tell a different story (3). A graduate of Damascus University, he still lives in the city and his studio is in one of the old quarters, where he goes to work every day. The figures he draws on delicate rice paper, tumble in all directions wide-eyed and contorted, their features and expressions inspired by the people he sees around him. Drawn to the ancient past, and to the art of the Babylonians, whose empire extended from Iraq into Syria, he writes: \u2018The Babylonians were depicting the human form 6000 years ago and I, along with others, am simply continuing what they began.\u2019\n(3) Fadi Yazigi (b.1966), Untitled.

They are women in traditional hijab who hang in ever-diminishing sizes from the branches of a tree, the thick trunk of which recalls the brush strokes of a calligrapher. The artist\u2019s intention is to shine a spotlight on what is known as honour killing, which refers to the murder (often by family members) of women accused of breaking social conventions governing gender relations.\n(4) Hayv Kahraman (b.1981) Honor Killing.

Funded by CaMMEA. \u00a9 Courtesy of the artist.\nAbstraction\nAbstraction, along with the use of geometry and script, is the second major theme within the works on display. An important feature of Islamic art, together with geometry and calligraphy, abstraction is also an influential strand in international modern art. The artists straddle these different worlds adapting shape, pattern, script, line and colour to represent complex, personal or conceptual subjects as can be seen in the following examples.\n(5) Susan Hefuna (b.1962) Knowledge is Sweeter than Honey. Sculpture made of wood stained with black ink, 2007. \u00a9 Courtesy of the artist.\nSusan Hefuna (born 1962) spent the first ten years of her life in Egypt, mostly in the Nile Delta and Alexandria. She now lives and works between Cairo, Berlin and New York. From 2004 she began working with Cairene craftsmen who make the wooden screens known as mashrabiya that filter the light and create privacy in traditional houses. In her versions, Hefuna places within them words or short texts in Arabic or English. One beautiful example is on display in the Sainsbury Africa Galleries at the Museum (Room 25) into which she has inserted the words in Arabic, \u2018Knowledge is Sweeter than Honey\u2019 (5). The designs of the wooden screens inspired the delicate abstract drawings displayed in the exhibition (6). Created from ink and layers of tracing and cartridge paper, Hefuna works in one sitting for many hours and compares her method to writing calligraphy, which also requires that intensive meditative process.\n(6) Susan Hefuna (b.1962) Building.

He writes his texts in all directions, lines are repeated and combined with mystical signs and symbols which appear in other media such as his Path of Roses installation (7) which was conceived as a tribute to the Sufi mystic Rumi (1207-73).\n(7) Iron sculpture part of Koraichi\u2019s installation in the Africa Gallery in Room 25.\nRachid Kora\u00efchi (b.1947), The Path of Roses. 2000-2004. \u00a9 Courtesy of the artist.\nHis etching included in Reflections, (8) is one of a series of prints entitled A Nation in Exile, a collaboration between Kora\u00efchi and the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish (1941\u20132008) whom he met in Tunis in 1982. \u2018It was not a question for me of illustrating his poems\u2019 described Kora\u00efchi, \u2018I loved his texts and he appreciated my work. I wanted to seize aesthetically the emotion that was the essence of the poem.\u2019 The poem \u2018It was what it will become\u2019, (the title is inscribed at the top of the etching), was written by Mahmoud Darwish as a tribute to his friend and poet Rashed Hassan who died tragically in a fire in New York.\n(8) Rachid Kora\u00efchi (b.1947), A Nation in Exile.

Many of these impressive, richly ornamented structures were built to commemorate key moments in Iran\u2019s history, from revolutions to coronations and military victories. The inspiration for this particular work (9) is a temporary structure set up in late 19th-century Tabriz, in western Iran. In Farhadian\u2019s rendering, the space becomes a stage set with ballet dancers emerging delicately through pink washes of paint. There is a darker side to this fantasy however, as on either side of the arch are cannons and military flags hinting at violence beneath the seemingly dreamy scene.\n(9) Mehdi Farhadian (b.1980) Cannons and Ballerinas.

Since then, a number of Tunisian artists have made work that re-examines the complex history of their country. Nidhal Chamekh (born 1985), for example, has focused on neglected histories and often uses newspaper cuttings which he repurposes to act as a reminder. In Nos visages no. XI (10) he tells the story of the many troops from the French colonies who helped to liberate France during the Second World War (1939-45) but who were afterwards cast aside and forgotten. The two contradictory half faces, taken from the newspaper Le Miroir, serve to emphasise the denial of their existence.\n(10) Nidhal Chamekh (b. 1985), Nos visages no. XI (Our Faces no. XI).

The displays of Arctic clothing in the Citi exhibition Arctic: culture and climate demonstrate the spectacular diversity of the fashionable ways of staying warm in a parka.\nTatiana Nomokonova and Nenets man travelling with a sled and reindeer, 2018.

We had to take care of them\u2026 If stored in a cold place, folded carefully and put away dry, a good parka could last longer than two years.\n\nMary Mucpa of Mittimatalik, Canada\nWhat are Arctic parkas made from?\nParkas have been made out of numerous kinds of material, but caribou or reindeer fur are widely preferred across the Arctic, due to their incredible warmth. Using a scanning electron microscope, Museum scientists have magnified a caribou hair to reveal a structure that looks like bubble-wrap. This traps hot air, which keeps the animal, or anyone wearing clothes made from the fur, very warm.\nA caribou hair viewed under a microscope, revealing its bubble wrap like structure.\nIf caribou or reindeer fur becomes wet, however, the hairs become saturated with water and are no longer able to trap heat. Therefore, removing snow and ice crystals from caribou or reindeer fur clothing is essential. Melted snow or ice would otherwise saturate the parka. This print depicts the everyday task of beating snow and ice crystals off fur clothing with a snow knife before bringing them into a warm home or shed.\nElena Tukkaevna Il\u2019key, (1947\u20132007), Beating Clothes. 2004.

Young fawns are often used for children\u2019s clothing. This elegant young woman\u2019s parka from Western Greenland is likely made from summertime caribou fur, when the hides were thinnest. It was carefully worked and trimmed to display the delicate motifs and trims.\nWoman\u2019s parka from Western Greenland. Kalaallit. Mid 1800s.\nBird feathers, fish skin and even seal gut are other materials used to make parkas, though they are used less commonly today. This beautiful black and white parka is made of bird skins, either from Little Auk or thick-billed murre birds. It is from Northwest Greenland and was made in the 1880s by an Inughuit seamstress. The American explorer Robert Peary collected it from Smith Sound, Nunavut, during one of his expeditions to the eastern Arctic. Just like the down that fills our puffer coats, these skin-on down and feathers insulate and repel moisture and would have been worn with the feathers against the skin.\nParka or jacket made of bird skin.

Made by Mrs James Kanuk. Mid 20th century. Kipnuk, Alaska, USA.\nWhat do different parka designs mean?\nBecause parkas and other sewn garments convey important messages about the skill of the maker and the success of his or her household, fur clothing is made to be beautiful. Seamstresses express their creativity and lineage in the functional garments they make. Trim patterns, such as that on the parka made by Inupiat seamstress Ester Norton of Kotzebue Alaska, are often passed down through families.\nEster Norton\u2019s fancy parka trim or kupak sewn together from pieces of black and white cow skin.\nDifferent styles and patterns indicate where someone is from and to whom they belong. Parkas are often made for family members as gifts. Some parkas are passed down to younger relatives, but most often parkas are made for one particular person. Because of their links to identity and family, parkas are worn proudly during celebrations and festivals, such as the end of the Iditarod Sled Dog race in Nome, Alaska.\nKarina Moeller, wearing a Yup\u2019ik women\u2019s fancy parka with wolverine and wolf ruff, and Phillip Blanchett of \u2018Pamyua\u2019 Inuit music band music band, celebrating with winner of the Iditarod Sled Dog Race in Nome Alaska, 2011.\nHow long have people been wearing parkas in the Arctic?\nTailored clothing, like parkas sewn by a needle, made life in the Arctic possible. Fitted clothing insulated people from the cold while enabling them to move freely to travel, hunt and accomplish tasks. While the earliest clothing items are extremely rare to find in the archaeological record, carved figurines and engraved images on bone, tusk, and antler depict people wearing garments with hoods going back 20,000 years!\nMammoth tusk needles and cases. Yana Rhinoceros Horn excavation site, Siberia, Russia, 30,000 years ago. Courtesy of the Institute for the history of Material Culture, Russian Academy of Sciences.\nMaking parkas and other tailored clothing was a complex business, involving the production of tools like needles, cases for needles and awls, and the tanning and treatment of raw materials and sewing techniques. What is more, because different furs have particular material properties, they serve different needs for individual wearers. Obtaining such raw materials, therefore required a pre-meditated hunting plan (choosing particular animals and the time of year to hunt them). It also required communication and coordination between the hunter and the maker of the clothing \u2013 roles historically distributed along gender lines.\nMammoth tusk needle and case.

Edgar WT Greenshield.\nHow do parkas keep you warm?\nThese very early Arctic seamstresses, like seamstresses from the North today, rely on thermodynamic properties of fur. Many groups of Indigenous Arctic Peoples wear two layers. Nenets men wear a hooded parka with fur inwards with a drawstring that traps warm air around the hood and waist, as shown by the Nenets reindeer herders below.\nNenets herders working with reindeer, Taimyr Peninula, 2018. \u00a9 Robert Losey, Tatiana Nomokonova and Dmitry Arzyutov.\nA second layer is worn with fur facing outward and sleeves are sewn with attached mittens. A slit is left at the wrist wide enough for a hand to slide through. This brilliant solution to the \u2018lost mitten problem\u2019 enables the wearer to quickly access their bare hands.\nAttached mitten on an Evenki parka with hand slit, 2019.\nNenets women wear a button-up parka called a yagushka. Both kinds of garments trap heat between two layers of fur. These parkas are loose enough to allow warm air to dissipate throughout the body and be released up through the hood so that the hides do not become wet from perspiration.\nMen\u2019s coat, calf-length, made from bear fur. Yagushka. Nenets, early 20th century.\nSimilarly, Inuit seamstresses make double-layered garments for men as well using the same technique as the Nenets seamstresses of making an inward fur layer, worn underneath an outward-facing fur layer. There are eight individual items made from caribou hide in this hunting attire made by Leonie Orunnaut from Iglulik, Canada, including: inner and outer trousers and parkas, fur socks, fur boots and thick mitts. While it looks quite heavy, Mary Mucpa explains that seamstresses scrape thin the epidermis layer, which greatly reduces the weight of hides. Seamstresses also create fringes on the bottom trim of these parkas in order to trap heat while standing but to enable walking and running when needed. This historical and ingenious method of insulation relied on the ecologically rich knowledge base of seamstresses, who understood the distinct properties of various furs and passed down their knowledge successfully, so that it is used even today.\nMen\u2019s hunting clothing and footwear. Made by Leonie Orunnut, Iglulik, Nunavut. Inuit. 1980s.\nProducing beautiful, functional and warm parkas involves handcrafted tools, ecological knowledge and generous relationships. Arctic Peoples describe hunting as the giving and receiving of gifts, not the killing of animals. The caribou used to make this hunting outfit gave itself willingly to the hunter, who presented the hide and meat to his wife. By sharing the meat with her community and making clothes for her husband, she mediates between hunter\u00a0 and animal. Seamstresses symbolically regenerate the prey in their sewn garments, made to resemble caribou to ensure future hunting success. The beauty of hides sewn, the evenness of the stitches in clothing and the durability of hunting attire underscores love and success.\nGirl\u2019s parka of velveteen and red fox fur.

The grave, made in Suffolk in the early seventh century, centred on a 27-metre-long ship beneath a three-metre-high mound. Inside was a vast assemblage of exquisite objects from an incredible geographical range, spanning Britain, Europe, the eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East and South Asia. Nothing like this had ever been encountered before and it transformed our understanding of England\u2019s early medieval past.\nGold belt-buckle found at Sutton Hoo. 7th century AD.\nDespite their glitzy appeal, The Dig (based on John Preston\u2019s 2007 book) largely eschews these objects to focus upon the discovery itself and the individuals involved: landowner Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan), Suffolk archaeologist Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes), Cambridge academic Charles W Phillips (Ken Stott), and his team, including Peggy Piggott (Lily James), who found the first piece of gold inside. The story of the excavation, overshadowed by impending war, is just as dramatic as the archaeology it uncovered and I am thrilled that The Dig will bring it to a wider audience.\nThe Sutton Hoo helmet. Late 6th-early 7th century AD.\nEdith Pretty famously donated the Sutton Hoo finds to the British Museum in an act (as the film notes) of unparalleled generosity. Other participants enriched the Museum\u2019s archive by donating archaeological drawings, film footage, photographs, letters and their remarkable diaries, forming a precious first-hand account of the discovery. So, I was not surprised when Hollywood came calling!\nTo give you an idea of how Netflix\u2019s vision compares with reality, I\u2019ve taken another look at the film alongside archival photos used by the filmmakers \u2013 and share some anecdotes about the Museum\u2019s involvement with the film\u2026\nThe Sutton Hoo ship\nThe imprint of the ship. Photograph by Charles W Phillips.\nThe imprint of the ship in The Dig. \u00a9 Larry Horricks/ Netflix 2021.\nIn summer 2019 I welcomed Oscar-nominated production designer Maria Djurkovic and art director Karen Wakefield to the British Museum. They were astonished by the number of photographs in the archive and spent hours combing through them over several visits. Their questions were completely different to those I am usually asked, aimed at understanding the excavation\u2019s physical, practical and visual realities rather than the details of what was found. Consequently, I found myself viewing these familiar images from a fresh perspective. The research paid off. In October I visited the set and was bowled over by the full-size recreation of the ship. It so closely resembled the photographs that I felt a little pang of emotion, realising that this was the closest that I would ever come to being there at the discovery that inspired me to study early medieval archaeology, putting me on the path to where I am today.\nBasil Brown, the archaeologist\nBasil Brown, photograph from his own album\nRalph Fiennes as Basil Brown in The Dig. \u00a9 Netflix 2021.\nRalph Fiennes visited the Museum twice to research Basil Brown and kept archivist Francesca Hillier and me on our toes with plenty of questions. He quickly latched onto Brown\u2019s distinctive way of expressing himself and his clothing (boots with tucked-in trousers, waistcoat, hat), remarking upon a pocket-watch that he always wears in photos \u2013 a detail that I was delighted to see in the final film. We also enjoyed a sneak preview of his East Anglian accent when he read a passage of Brown\u2019s diary aloud! This image is from Brown\u2019s own photograph album, with his characteristic labelling in typed capitals.\nEdith Pretty, the landowner\nEdith Pretty (sitting in the centre on the edge of the trench) observes the dig. Photograph by OGS Crawford\nCarey Mulligan as Edith Pretty observing the excavations in The Dig. \u00a9 Netflix 2021.\nThis scene, in which Edith Pretty observes the excavations from a wicker chair, was being filmed when I visited the set. Several \u2018archaeologists\u2019 were working in the ship, creating a tableau that I recognised immediately with great delight \u2013 right down to their costumes, like WF Grimes\u2019s boiler suit with white plimsolls. It was as if the archival photographs had come to life.\nBasil Brown and Charles W. Phillips, a fraught relationship?\nBasil Brown and Charles W. Phillips. Photograph by Basil Brown.\nKen Stott as Charles Philips stands at the end of the trench in The Dig. \u00a9 Netflix 2021.\nThe film portrays the relationship between Basil Brown and Charles W Phillips, appointed by the Office of Works to supervise the dig, as quite antagonistic \u2013 a clash of class and culture between the self-taught archaeologist and Cambridge academic. While there is naturally some dramatic licence, Brown\u2019s writings show that the men did not always see eye-to-eye at first. In his diary, Brown notes that Phillips was \u2018a bit bellicose\u2019 and on one occasion describes \u2018a lively passage of words between us\u2019. Fortunately, they buried the hatchet quickly and their relationship developed into one of collaboration and mutual respect. In the first major account of the dig, published within a year, Phillips praised Brown\u2019s \u2018commendable care and skill\u2019 in excavating the ship (Antiquity, 1940).\nStriking gold\nPeggy Piggott excavates the gold buckle. Photograph by John Brailsford.\nLily James as Peggy Piggot (also known as Peggy Preston) in The Dig. \u00a9 Netflix 2021.\nOne of my favourite scenes in the film is when archaeologist Peggy Piggott uncovers the first piece of gold from the burial \u2013 a garnet-encrusted scabbard mount. It\u2019s a magical moment that also happens to be completely true. It took place on 21 July 1939 and kicked off days of jaw-dropping discoveries (compressed into hours in the film) as the burial chamber yielded its secrets. Basil Brown wrote in his diary, \u2018I must admit that I never expected to see so much gold in any dig in this country\u2026 All the objects shone in the sunshine as on the day they were buried.\u2019 Also like the film, Edith Pretty insisted that Brown be the one to convey the objects to her house for safekeeping. \u2018So I had the honour,\u2019 he records, \u2018of carrying in the golden treasure\u2026without any of the servants being aware of the fact. Needless to say I did not go home that afternoon.\u2019 Peggy Piggott\u2019s first discovery was not captured on camera, but this photo shows her excavating the great gold buckle, delicately clearing its shimmering, serpentine surface. We can only imagine what she was thinking as she did so.\nSpectacular finds\nTop left: gold lid of a leather purse. Top right: gold buckle. Both excavated at Sutton Hoo. 7th century AD. Bottom: Objects being excavated.\nThe Sutton Hoo finds make only a few cameo appearances in The Dig, but these moments are wonderfully realised. Following archival photographs like this one, top-quality replicas made by David Roper of Ganderwick Creations \u2013 ideal stand-ins \u2013 were laid out just as they had been found in 1939, ready to be discovered 80 years later by the film\u2019s \u2018archaeologists\u2019.\nRecreating the ship\u2019s rivets\nIron ship rivet, early 7th century, Sutton Hoo.\nOther finds from the burial were made specifically for the film. Prop-maker Len Wheeler came to view the iron ship rivets in the British Museum\u2019s stores and I watched, amazed, as he fashioned a perfect copy from metal rods and putty \u2013 the only difference being that it was a strange colour! The resulting prop, produced from Basil Brown\u2019s handkerchief at a key moment in the film, is thoroughly convincing.\nSutton Hoo on the eve of war\nThe ship filled with bracken. Photograph by Charles W Phillips.\nIn The Dig\u2019s closing scenes, Basil Brown fills the ship with bracken as Britain enters the Second World War. This was indeed his final act on site and the timing could not have been more dramatic. In his diary for 31 August, he writes \u2018Continued getting bracken etc. Will fill in the ship and prepare for a long period if possible should war break out. Mrs Pretty thinks it will not come.\u2019 But come it did, just three days later. Brown closes his record of this most significant discovery \u2013 for him, for Mrs Pretty, for the excavators and for the world \u2013 with poignant pragmatism. \u2018This practically finishes the log of Sutton Hoo Dig for duration of war\u2026I completed the filling up [of the] ship with the help of Spooner\u2026and then went on with estate work.

It doesn\u2019t have \u2018letters\u2019 \u2013 instead it uses between 600 and 1,000 characters impressed on clay to spell words by dividing them up into syllables, like \u2018ca-at\u2019 for cat, or \u2018mu-zi-um\u2019 for museum.

In 1579, the woman, named Arnaq, and her son Nulaq, were captured by Martin Frobisher\u2019s crew members during their violent expedition to southern Iqaluit, on southern Qikiqtaaluk (Baffin Island).

Mittimatalik, Nunavut. 2019.\n\u2018Amautis have always been part of my life. Growing up, women around me all wore them. I was eighteen when I had my first daughter. As my due date approached, my mother grew increasingly worried that she didn\u2019t have a pattern to fit my small frame. Her friend Alice had a pattern from her late aunt. Mom and Alice worked together on my amauti: it was a beautiful white one with red and pink ribbon trim and red fox-fur trim around the hood. Alice taught me how to weave sashes using matching wool. I was thankful for that lesson. I had always admired my grandmother Angutainuk\u2019s sashes and Alice taught me that design.\u2019\nDetails of Sheila Katsak\u2019s amauti. Images courtesy of the Mittimatalik Arnait Miqsuqtuit Collective.\n\u2018With my second child, I sewed my own amauti. I was still young, twenty- four, and I had all kinds of design visions. I wanted it to be stylish. Modern. I thought dark navy fabric with contrasting white fur would be beautiful. My mother taught me to cut and sew pattern pieces. Since then, I have made so many more amautis! Since my oldest daughter started having babies, I\u2019ve been experimenting with different styles. I am never satisfied! The design I envision and the actual making of them always differ. Now my daughter is learning to make her own.\u2019\nSheila Katsak carries her daughter in her amauti. Image courtesy of the Mittimatalik Arnait Miqsuqtuit Collective.\n\u2018For all my four children I\u2019ve had different winter and summer amautis. Making the winter amauti I have right now, I returned to a traditional design, white fabric with a long tail. It\u2019s my best work in terms of design! I drew inspiration for the trim from a photo of my grandmother Agalakti\u2019s amauti circulating on social media, using burgundy, two shades of pink and a black ribbon to accentuate the traditional sharp lines of the tail. I saw Agalakti\u2019s photo after I had begun sewing, so I had to undo some of the stitches. I also drew inspiration from a used amauti I had that was made in Clyde River. It had a tail and trim with sharp accentuated lines and corners, a gradual shoulder drop and narrow cuffs that I thought would make it very warm, and a big hood. I sewed dark fox-fur trim on the hood to contrast with the white, and I wove a matching sash in the manner that Alice taught me, using my grandmother Angutainuk\u2019s design. The hood on this pattern is so big! When I carry my baby, she sways when she stands. Not like my first amauti made for me that kept my baby upright. With this one, I have to keep adjusting the hood. It is awkward to wear. My small shoulders and frame are not made for it. Still, I love this amauti and my baby has grown accustomed to it. And designing this amauti made me more confident in my sewing.\u2019\nSheila Katsak carries her daughter in her amauti. Image courtesy of the Mittimatalik Arnait Miqsuqtuit Collective.\n\u2018I\u2019ve relied on amautis for all my years raising children. They let me pack my babies and go. Babies get excited when amautis come out. It means a trip to the stores, the health centre, or just out visiting. When I was expecting my first child, it was my mother who knew I needed one. She knew that, for mothers, amautis are functional and required in raising children.

Many of the men now wear trouser suits, which were invented by Scythian nomads, as the Persian gowns are not as practical for riding.\nGold votive plaque showing man wearing trousers (part of the Oxus Treasure). Tajikistan, Achaemenid period, 5\u20134th century BC.\nThings to see and do\nThe ornamental gardens are so amazing they have invented a special word for them: paradise. These are formal gardens arranged on a \u2018four square\u2019 geometric plan with small stone water channels for the different flower beds, and they use poplar trees for shade. It\u2019s best to check with a local in case there\u2019s an admission policy though.\nPostcard with photograph of the ruins of Persepolis, Iran, 1960s.\nRising above the city is the citadel \u2013 if you can get access, it is spectacular, as is the view from the top. It is approached by large staircases with shallow steps suitable for anyone in long robes or with limited mobility, and entered through a gatehouse. There are lots of courtyards inside, with columned halls raised on platforms, and carved reliefs.\nLimestone relief fragment showing a seated male sphinx. Persepolis (modern-day Iran), Achaemenid period, probably 4th century BC.\nIf you are lucky enough to be invited to the court, prepare to be overwhelmed with its splendour. The court is huge \u2013 one king had 329 concubines who played musical instruments, 46 men to weave garlands, 277 cooks to make fancy titbits, 29 caterers, 70 men who strain wine, and 14 perfumiers. (Alexander the Great later came here and burnt the place to the ground but, when he saw all the gold tablewares, the apartment heady with fragrant smells, remarked \u2018This, it seems, is what it means to be a king\u2019.)\nShopping\nMake sure you visit the bazaar if you want to take home some beautiful souvenirs. The word \u2018bazaar\u2019 is Persian in origin and quite rightly evokes a sense of exotic riches, rich smells and curios piled up in abundance. You can buy anything under the sun at Parsa if you have enough silver: there is frankincense from Southern Arabia, gold from India, carpets from Central Asia, and cut glass from western Turkey, plus plenty of local goods too. Remember that they estimate the value of goods according to their weight and, if you\u2019ve come with Phoenician or other foreign coins, they\u2019ll simply weigh them as pieces of silver as they don\u2019t use coins as such here. Always remember to bargain!\nEntertainment\nSpring is widely celebrated in Iran as it is a period when the weather improves and the country is bathed in green. It is a time when people bring each other gifts and wear new clothes. Some say that is why the reliefs show people in local dress bringing distinctive products to the king, but it is more likely that they show how keen everyone is to be part of his empire, as they remember what happened when people rebelled at the beginning of the reign of Darius I and it was not very pleasant at all as he cut off the nose and ears of the ringleaders, blinded them in one eye and then impaled them.\nA delegation bring gifts of precious metal and a chariot fit for a king, Persepolis, 500 BC.\nWhere to stay\nThe city has an attractive position on the plain and most of the city is made up of single-storey houses built of sundried bricks. The best thing is to try lodge with someone, as Persian hospitality is wonderful.\nThe city is overshadowed by the citadel where royalty live when they are not travelling or staying in their other royal seats at Ecbatana, Susa and Babylon. The citadel is heavily fortified and new palaces are constantly being built or modified. Unless you are a royal guest, or bringing expensive presents or an important letter by hand, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll get the chance to enter.\nLeft: Reconstruction of the visitor\u2019s first view into the citadel as you enter through the gate. Right: Reconstruction of the view of the audience hall (Apadana) at Persepolis.\nThe upper classes live near the citadel. If you are coming to Iran for the first time, you are unlikely to have seen houses like this before. They have columned halls, and the only light enters through the doorways or roof-lights in the ceilings, so it is a little dark at first, but your eyes soon adjust.\nFood and drink\nIranian food is justly famous, and full of sweet and sour combinations, with juicy fruits, nuts and complex recipes. Cumin and cardamom are commonly used. Garlic, onions, pomegranates and pistachios are popular too. They make a strong sauce from capers in brine, which is quite like soy sauce. Flat bread is the most popular bread from bakeries. Salt is imported from mines almost as far as Zanjan in northwest Iran, and there is a novelty Indian food called rice, which is used in sweet puddings.\nVessels of gold, silver and cut glass like these were used at Persepolis, 500 BC.\nFine dining\nWhen the kings dine, all their servants bathe and wear fine clothing, and they spend almost half the day preparing for dinner. Dressing down is definitely frowned upon and men and women really look after their personal appearance. So be sure to dress the part if you are lucky enough to be invited to dinner at the court. Eating and drinking are done together, as the Persians know it\u2019s important to have a substantial meal when you\u2019re drinking!\nDrinking\nAt court, drinks are served in different kinds of golden goblets, and the royal wine is lavish and drunk without restraint. It\u2019s probably no coincidence that you\u2019ve heard of a wine called Shiraz, as it\u2019s named after a city that\u2019s not far away.\nHammered silver bowls, Turkey, Achaemenid period, about 5th century BC.\nIf you can\u2019t afford gold, silver or even bronze, there are identical drinking bowls made of pottery. Someone cleverly realised that red wine stains, so they cover the pottery with a red slip so it doesn\u2019t show.\nCup-bearers are very careful to pour your wine for you but you have to hold the bowl with your finger-tips, so drinking large amounts takes skill and practice if you don\u2019t want to be mistaken for a silly foreigner!\nLocal laws and customs\nBe careful what you say about the king as the people called his \u2018eyes and ears\u2019 are everywhere, looking and listening for people who disagree with him. If you speak out against the king, impaling, flaying and burial alive are well-known forms of punishment.\nLimestone relief fragment showing armed guards, Persepolis (in modern-day Iran), Achaemenid period, 6\u20135th century BC.\nReligion\nThe people now follow a religion called Zoroastrianism with a supreme god called Ahura Mazda, and well-defined principles of good and evil. However, when the former king Cyrus the Great captured Babylon, he was so impressed by the city that he started to build a huge imitation of its famous glazed Ishtar Gate at Persepolis, although it was taken down afterwards. Some mutter quietly that Cyrus fell under the spell of the great Babylonian god Marduk as he was rather well-spoken about him in a proclamation he made which was written down on the Cyrus Cylinder.\nHand-coloured 19th-century print titled Persiani, showing Zoroastrian priests at an external fire altar at Persepolis.\nContinue your holiday-from-home around Persepolis with a virtual visit to The Rahim Irvani Gallery (Room 52) of Ancient Iran, which covers Iranian history from 3000 BC to AD 651.

One of a group of eight floor tiles at the British Museum associated with the church at Tring, Hertfordshire. 14th century.\nDiet wasn\u2019t just affected by the seasons, religion also played a part in what people ate. Fridays (and, in the earlier period, Wednesdays and Saturdays) were obligatory weekly fasting or \u2018fysshe\u2019 days, when it was prohibited to eat meat. There were also annual fasts such as Rogation Days, Advent and Lent, which restricted diets. Medieval cooks invented creative recipes for wealthy diners during fast periods \u2013 including mock hard-boiled eggs made of coloured almond paste inside blown shells for Lent, when dairy was prohibited!\nThe Last Supper. Engraving. Around 1450-1500. Print made by Monogrammist AG.\nA huge amount of preparation went into the creation of feasts. When the whole royal court assembled, hundreds of people could be sitting down to eat. For the two great feasts at Easter and Christmas, preparations had to start months ahead, when preserves were ordered and made. Fasting took place in the Advent period, meaning four weeks of lean eating to prepare for the feast.\nA restored medieval kitchen inside Verrucole Castle, Tuscany. Photo: Simone Letari.

Pickling was an important way of preserving vegetables in the Middle Ages, and still is.\nThe French Medieval household book Le M\u00e9nagier de Paris (the Goodman of Paris) had recipes for pickling walnuts and various vegetables and fruits grown on the fictional writer\u2019s farm, but he soaked the whole lot in honey \u2013 probably ruining the teeth of everyone in his household! This recipe is not quite as sweet and is more like modern recipes.\nSwap the honey for sugar to make this vegan.\nMakes 2.3kg\nIngredients\n900g mixed parsley roots, carrots, radishes and turnips\n450g white cabbage\n450g hard eating pears\n6 tbsp salt\n1 tsp ground ginger\n1\u20442 tsp dried saffron strands\n425ml white wine vinegar\n50g currants\n575ml fruity white wine\n6 tbsp clear honey\n1 tsp of French mustard\n1\u20448 tsp each of ground cinnamon and black pepper\n1\u20444 tsp each of anise and fennel seeds\n50g white sugar\nMethod\nWash and peel the root vegetables and slice them thinly. Core and shred the cabbage. Put the vegetables into a large pan of water and slowly bring to the boil. Peel, core and cut up the pears and add them to the pan. Cook until they start to soften. Drain the contents of the pan and spread in a 5cm layer in a shallow non-metallic dish. Sprinkle with the salt, ginger, saffron and 4 tbsp of the vinegar. Leave, covered, for 12 hours. Rinse well, then add the currants. Pack into sterilised storage jars, with at least 2.5cm headspace. Put the wine and honey in a pan. Bring to simmering point and skim. Add the rest of the vinegar and all the remaining spices and sugar. Reduce the heat and stir without boiling until the sugar dissolves. Bring back to the boil. Pour over the vegetables, covering them with 1cm of liquid.

Around 15th century.\nThe French Medieval household book Le M\u00e9nagier de Paris (the Goodman of Paris), has quite a lot to say about cabbages, from the small spring sprouts for salads to the frostbitten winter leaves. However, the recommendation to boil cabbages all morning is best ignored! This recipe could be made as a starter, or as a main course if you add small pieces of toast and small strips of fried bacon \u2013 both well-known medieval additions.\nServes 4\nIngredients\n600g firm-hearted cabbage or 700g open-hearted cabbage or spring greens\n225g onions, peeled and finely chopped\n225g white part of leeks, thinly sliced into rings\nA tsp of dried saffron strands\n1\u20442 tsp of salt\n1\u20444 tsp each of ground coriander, cinnamon and sugar\n850ml chicken or vegetable stock\nMethod\nIf using a firm-hearted cabbage cut it into eight segments and remove the centre core. If using an open-hearted cabbage or greens, cut off the stalks and cut the leaves into strips. Put into a large pan with the prepared onions and leeks. Stir the saffron, salt and spices into the stock, adjusting the quantity of salt if required, then pour the mixture over the vegetables. Cook gently, covered, for about 20 minutes or until segments of firm cabbage are tender.\n\u2018Departed\u2019 creamed fish\nTo make mortreux of fisch. Tak plays or fresch meluel or merlyng & seth it in fayre water, and then tak awey the skyn & the bones & presse the fisch in a cloth & bray it in a mortere, and tempre it vp with almond melk, & bray poudere of gynger & sugre togedere & departe the mortreux on tweyne in two pottes & coloure that on with saffroun & dresch it in disches, half of that on & half of that other, & strawe poudere of gyngere & sugre on that on & clene sugre on that other & serue it forth.\n\nCurye on Inglysch, III. 26\nPottery figurine of a woman carrying a fish. 14th century.\nMortrews was a type of pottage or pat\u00e9 that contained either fish or meat, mixed with almonds. \u2018Departed\u2019 just means that the dish is \u2018parted in two\u2019 different colours. The Medieval household book Le M\u00e9nagier de Paris (the Goodman of Paris) suggested a chicken liver or meat mortrews, but this fish option would be a good substitute on \u2018fysshe\u2019 days when eating meat was forbidden.\nServes 6 as a starter\nIngredients\n\u2022 600g skinned cod fillet\n\u2022 A pinch of sea salt\n\u2022 125g ground almonds\n\u2022 2 tsp rice flour or corn flour\n\u2022 3 tbsp deep yellow saffron water or food colouring\n\u2022 1\u20442 tsp ground ginger\n\u2022 3\u20444 tsp white sugar\nMethod\nPoach the fish fillet in about 575ml of salted water until cooked through. Drain off the cooking liquid into a measuring jug. Pour 275ml of this liquid over the almonds in a bowl. Press the \ufb01sh under a cloth or kitchen paper to squeeze out excess moisture, then flake it. Strain the almond \u2018milk\u2019 into a jug, stirring to separate the free liquid from the almond sludge in the strainer. Put the liquid into an electric blender, followed by the flaked fish, and process until smooth. If the mixture is too stiff to process easily, add a little more fish cooking liquid. Turn the mixture into a bowl. In a small saucepan, cream the rice flour or cornflour with 3 or 4 tbsp of fish cooking liquid, then heat the mixture gently until it thickens. Stir this \u2018cream\u2019 into the fish mixture and season with salt. Put half the mixture into a separate bowl and tint it deep gold with the saffron water or food colouring. Combine the ground ginger and 1\u20444 tsp of the sugar and mix into the golden fish, reserving a little of the mixture for sprinkling. If you like ginger, increase the quantity. Serve the mortrews in six small bowls or plates, putting a coloured and a plain spoonful of mixture side by side in each. Chill until needed. Just before serving, sprinkle the remaining ginger/sugar mix on the gold portions and the remaining 1\u20442 tsp plain sugar on the white portions.\nMain dishes\nSpit-roasted or grilled steak\nTo make Stekys of venson or bef.

But another recipe from the Medieval household book Le M\u00e9nagier de Paris (the Goodman of Paris) suggests using the juice of Seville oranges. If you can get these in season and freeze them, you can use their juice as a substitute for verjuice \u2013 it makes a delicious sauce. Nick the edges of the steaks and grease them. Mix the sauce ingredients in a jug, adjusting the proportions if you wish. Then grill the steaks as you prefer. Warm the sauce and sprinkle a few drops over the meat while grilling it. Serve the steaks lightly sprinkled with cinnamon and any remaining sauce.\nMushroom pasties (vegetarian, can be made vegan)\nMushrooms of one night are the best, if they are small, red inside, and closed at the top: and they should be peeled and then washed in hot water and parboiled, and if you wish to put them in a pasty add oil, cheese and spice powder.\n\nThe Goodman of Paris, trans.

Around 1490\u20131500.\nThis recipe is from the Medieval household book Le M\u00e9nagier de Paris (the Goodman of Paris). At home it is likely that the fictional narrator of the book, who kept a well-furnished table, would serve a large double-crust pasty or plate pie \u2013 but on his journeys to and from the farm, small ones probably seemed more suitable.\nServes 6\nIngredients\n\u2022 450g home-made or bought shortcrust pastry, thawed if frozen\n\u2022 450g button mushrooms\n\u2022 Pinch of salt\n\u2022 2 tbsp olive oil\n\u2022 50g Cheddar cheese, grated\n\u2022 1\u20442 tsp salt\n\u2022 1\u20448 tsp freshly ground black pepper\n\u2022 1\u20444 tsp dry mustard powder\n\u2022 1 egg, beaten\nTo make this recipe vegan use vegan pastry, omit the cheese or use vegan cheese, and use soy, rice or almond milk instead of the egg to seal the pastry.\nMethod\nUse two-thirds of the pastry to line small, deep pans. Chill while making the filling. Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0C. Trim off and discard the bottoms of the mushroom stems, then dip the mushrooms in boiling salted water, holding them in a sieve. Drain them, pat dry, then chop or slice them. Put them in a bowl and mix them with the oil, cheese and seasonings. Fill the mixture into the pastry cases. Roll out the remaining pastry and use it to make lids for the pasties. Seal the lids with beaten egg. Decorate the tops with pastry trimmings and brush with the remaining egg. Make a small crosscut in the centre of each lid. Bake the little pies in the oven for 15\u201318 minutes. Serve warm.\nLamb or mutton stew\nTake veel other[wise] motoun and smyte it to gobettes.

Put the stock into a stewpan and bring to the boil. Add the meat and bring back to the boil. Skim if needed, then add the prepared onions, herbs, spices, salt and wine. Reduce the heat, cover the pan and cook gently until the meat cubes are cooked through and tender (1\u20131 1/2 hours). Beat the eggs with the lemon juice until blended, then take the pan off the heat and stir the egg mixture gradually into the stew to thicken it slightly.

Woodcut print with hand-colouring (book illustration).\nServes 6\nThis dish is a type of civet, which is a form of stew, usually made with meat of game. In old dishes the cook is usually told to \u2018drawe\u2019 a fish, animal or bird, so this recipe interprets \u2018yopened\u2019 to mean that the fish or meat should be cut open and boned. It could then easily be cut in pieces and eaten with a spoon. Oil could be used by strict (and wealthy) dieters for frying food in Lent, but poor people would probably use butter, and omit the costly saffron, as we\u2019ve done here as it\u2019s still costly!\nIngredients\n900g haddock fillet\nSalt\n75g onions, peeled and finely chopped\nOil or butter for frying\n1\u20444 tsp ground white pepper\n75g fine soft white breadcrumbs\n125ml brown ale\nMethod\nSkin the haddock fillet and cut into several pieces. Put enough salted water into a shallow pan to cover the fish and bring it to the boil. Put in the fish and simmer for a moment or two, then cover the pan and remove from the heat \u2013 the fish will continue to cook in the hot water while you make the sauce. For this, fry the onions in the fat until just beginning to brown. Mix the pepper with the breadcrumbs and add them to the onions with the ale and 225ml of the water used to cook the fish. Process until smooth in an electric blender, then simmer for a few minutes to reheat.\nWhile simmering, drain the remaining water from the cooked fish and put the pieces on the grill rack. Brush them with a little melted fat, then place them under a hot grilling flame until they are just beginning to glaze. Cut them into bite-sized or serving portions and spoon some sauce over them. Serve the rest separately. If you don\u2019t like ale or beer you can use cider instead.\nDesserts\nCherry pottage (vegetarian)\nTak cheryes & do out the stones & grynde hem wel & draw hem thorw a streynour & do it in a pot. & do therto whit gres or swete botere & myed wastel bred, & cast therto good wyn & sugre, & salte it & stere it wel togedere, & dresse it in disches; and set theryn clowe gilofre, & strewe sugre aboue.\n\nMnesitheus, quoted in Oribasius, Medical Collections 4, 4, 1\nA variety of trees including fruit trees.

Soluble gold gouache can be used to gild the tops of whole cloves, but don\u2019t eat them as they are very strong \u2013 they\u2019re just for decoration here.\nServes 6\nIngredients\n900g fresh ripe red cherries\n350ml red wine\n175g white sugar\n50g unsalted butter\n225g soft white breadcrumbs\nPinch of salt\nFlower heads of small clove pinks or gilded whole cloves (according to season)\nCoarse white sugar for sprinkling\nMethod\nWash the cherries and discard the stems and stones. Pur\u00e9e the fruit in a blender with 150ml of the wine and half the sugar. Add a little more wine if you need to. Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the fruit pur\u00e9e, breadcrumbs, remaining wine, sugar and salt. Simmer, stirring steadily, until the pur\u00e9e is very thick. Pour into a serving bowl, cover and leave to cool. When quite cold, decorate the edge of the bowl with flowers or whole cloves, and sprinkle coarse sugar over the centre.\nCream custard tart (vegetarian)\nDoucetes.

Add the pastry to a 20cm pie plate or cake tin with a loose bottom, with a depth of 5cm. Bake \u2018blind\u2019 in a preheated oven at 200\u00b0C for 15\u201320 minutes, then remove the filling of dried beans and return the case to the oven at about 160\u00b0C for 6\u20138 minutes until dried out and firm. Remember a cake tin is deeper than a pie plate so the case in it may need longer baking than usual. Beat the egg yolks lightly in a bowl, then beat in the cream, milk, sugar, saffron water and salt.

Blanch the petals in boiling water for 2 minutes, then press them between several sheets of soft kitchen paper and put a heavy flat weight on top to squeeze them dry. (They may look depressingly greyish but blending will improve the dish\u2019s colour.) Put the rice flour or cornflour in a saucepan, and blend into it enough of the milk to make a smooth cream. Stir in the remaining milk. Place the pan over low heat and stir until the mixture starts to thicken. Put in a (non-medieval!) electric blender, and add the sugar, spices and rose petals. Process until fully blended, then add and blend in the cream and salt. Turn the mixture into a heavy saucepan, and stir over very low heat, below the boil, until it is the consistency of softly whipped cream.

Many imagine it to be a quiet life of bookish research, fieldwork and contemplation of objects. These are important parts of our jobs but there is far more to it than that. We also deal with a variety of queries, from loan requests to press enquiries, and some of us also handle enquiries of another sort, when objects are thought to have been stolen or trafficked illegally.\nOur advice is sought in confidence for verification and quick action. Sadly, many of the cases coming to us over the past years have related to regions in the Middle East and Central Asia where I have either worked or have curatorial responsibility. I have therefore helped develop a process by which matters can be dealt with carefully and sensitively. Readers of this blog may have seen other stories about objects being returned to Afghanistan and Iraq. These cases involved working closely with other specialist curators. We can now share another case, again involving Iraq, and how we have worked with the Art and Antiques Unit of the Metropolitan Police Service to identify and return a rare ancient sculpture to that country.\nSumerian plaque in presentation box.\nThe object is an important carved Sumerian wall plaque. It appeared on an online sales platform in May 2019, where it was misleadingly described as a \u2018Western Asiatic Akkadian tablet\u2019. It was said to come from a private collection formed in the 1990s but without any further provenance. We brought it to the attention of the Metropolitan Police Service (Art and Antiques Unit) who investigated it further with the auctioneers and the consigner, who expressed surprise that it was looted and agreed that it should instead be repatriated to Iraq with the assistance of the Museum. The police then brought the object to us. A small meeting followed as the BM curators discussed it around a table: was it genuine? If ancient, could we determine its age and where it was from? Was it stolen from a museum or could it have been looted from an archaeological site? Has the object been written about before or was it unknown? The meeting was short and the answers were quick.\nThe Sumerian plaque.\nIt is part of a votive wall plaque dating to about 2400 BC and belonging to the Early Dynastic III period of southern Iraq. It is carved from local stone and shows a large, seated male figure, clean-shaven, and wearing a typically Sumerian form of long skirt, known as a kaunakes, which was woven in a tufted pattern. The individual is a high-status male, either a high-priest or a ruler. He holds a ceremonial goblet or conical beaker in his right upraised hand, while his left holds a palm frond on his lap. He sits on a decorated stool. It is part of a larger, originally square, plaque probably measuring about 25cm across, divided into different scenes with the uppermost scene showing a ritual banquet. There were probably two further rows below, and comparison with other similar plaques suggests that the central scene may have contained either individuals bringing provisions for the banquet or a row of animals, and the lowest scene soldiers, musicians, dancers or wrestlers.\nTemple plaques such as this are rare \u2013 there are only around 50 known examples. These are from important Sumerian city-sites in modern-day southern and central Iraq and eastern Syria, including the famous sites of Ur, Nippur, Khafajah and Mari. They are thought to have been originally attached to the wall by means of a large knob inserted through a hole in the centre, although sadly none have yet been found in situ at ancient sites. The style of this particular piece places it in the Sumerian heartland of southern Iraq, rather than the other regions where they have been found.\nThe plaque would have been fixed to a temple wall at the point where a rope was tied around a central peg in order to secure the door shut. The location for this type of fastening is indicated on this photograph of an old house in Iraq.\nThere are traces of burning on the object which appear to be intentional and target the important figure. Just like the smashing of the plaque in antiquity, it probably marks a violent act in the life of the temple it came from. Sadly, such features are nothing new, and can be seen vividly on many of the late Assyrian sculptures from Nineveh and Nimrud, dating to when the capital and other centres of power across Assyria were stormed and sacked by Babylonian and Median armies in the late seventh century BC. They are also a feature of many Sumerian objects, as statues have been beheaded and royal monuments smashed into fragments. This applies to many previously excavated at the site of the ancient Sumerian city of Girsu (or Tello as it is now called), where my colleague S\u00e9bastien Rey has been directing excavations as a core part of the archaeological training provided by the British Museum\u2019s government-funded Iraq Scheme, and it is possible that the plaque comes from there as it was extensively looted in the 1990s during the Gulf War, and most recently in 2003 during the Iraq War. The rarity of the piece and the lack of any detailed history of previous ownership history certainly point to it coming from such looting, rather than being an unremarked mantlepiece ornament for the past century.\nDrone image of recent excavations at the Eninnu temple at Girsu (Tello), an area previously looted in 2003. Dani Tagen \u00a9 Tello/Girsu Archaeological Project, Iraq Scheme.\nThis piece is an exciting and important new discovery, has not been previously published, nor is it known to be listed on any museum inventory. Since its recovery, the Minister of Culture in Baghdad generously permitted it to go on display at the British Museum. We are delighted that, following his official visit to the Museum on 23 October, the Prime Minister of Iraq, His Excellency Mustafa al-Kadhimy, proposed that we extend its display until 6 January so that more of our visitors could see it after the second lockdown. The plaque will then be returned to Iraq at the beginning of next year.\nThe pits on this photograph from 2018 show the extent of looting at an important site in southern Iraq.\nWe have a unique relationship and a great joint cooperation with the British Museum in various fields including returning stolen Iraqi antiquities, training Iraqi archaeologists, and the reconstruction of archaeological sites damaged by terrorism. We extend our gratitude to the British Museum staff for their efforts and cooperation with us and look forward to our continued and remarkable cooperation well into the future.\n\nHis Excellency Mohammad Jaafar Al-Sadr, ambassador of the Republic of Iraq.\nThe British Museum has a very long history of working with the cultural heritage sector abroad, as well as in the UK. It also advises on official export papers and cases where there is concern that objects may have been stolen or trafficked. In addition to the Metropolitan Police, we work very closely with the UK Border Force. Objects that are seized are brought to the British Museum for identification, analysis and cataloguing. The Museum then liaises with colleagues in the national museums and antiquities organisations of the countries concerned to arrange the return of these objects. This process has proved highly successful, is endorsed officially by countries across the Middle East and Central Asia, we are delighted to have been able to repatriate thousands of stolen objects seized or handed over in this manner to Iraq, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, and this work is continuing.\nYou can see this plaque on display in Room 53 until 6 January 2021.\nRead more about the work that the British Museum does in helping to stop the illegal trade of antiquities, in this blog on identifying and returning looted objects and this blog on the illicit trade of fake antiquities.\nThe Museum also runs the Circulating Artefacts (CircArt) project, a groundbreaking initiative launched in 2018 against the widespread global trade in illicit antiquities from Egypt and Sudan.

Shiva is a shava (corpse) without the feminine presence of Shakti.\nIn East India, from 1757, Bengal was the epicentre of colonial British rule as well as an early site of Tantric practice. The Tantric goddess Kali, who rose to prominence in Bengal at this time, provided her devotees with maternal love while embodying the cosmic interconnectedness of creation and destruction. From the early 19th century, British missionaries and imperialists in India fantasised about Tantra, and Kali worship in particular, as a depraved cult of violence and ecstasy that justified their civilising presence. This moralistic interpretation was also common among Westernised middle-class Bengalis in the colonial capital of Calcutta (now Kolkata).\nHowever, alongside their growing disillusionment with British rule, many found a way to reconnect with their own cultural heritage with the help of Ramakrishna \u2013 a Tantric mystic living on the outskirts of the city. Ramakrishna enticed middle-class audiences with his earthy folk wisdom and displays of ecstatic mysticism, often expressing his love for the goddess Kali through songs and dance, expressing playful, childlike devotion. Operating outside of Hindu orthodoxy, he offered a free space of mystical experimentation far removed from both the strictures of caste society and the daily humiliations of colonial submission.\nWhereas other Hindu traditions understood the world as an illusion (maya), a dream from which to wake, Ramakrishna\u2019s Tantric theology celebrated it as shakti or creative feminine power. This offered middle-class householders a way to pursue meaningful religion without renouncing society and their material interests. Instead, they could celebrate material existence as a \u2018house of fun\u2019 and participate freely in divine creation like playful children of Kali, the divine mother, aspiring to transform and not transcend the world. Kali, the dynamic and active principle, stands over and above the passive and transcendent god Shiva. For a class looking to resist Western commercialism, even while they participated in it, Ramakrishna\u2019s Tantric worldview provided an appropriate model. His disciples later promoted his message of inclusive salvation around the world, projecting him as a modern living messiah.\nRamakrishna rides to heaven with Kali above his famous Dakshineswar temple on the Ganges. Chromolithograph, Bengal, India, 20th century.\nMother goddess to motherland\nThroughout the 1870s and 1880s, as the Bengali middle-classes were confronted by the oppressive realities of empire, they increasingly looked to indigenous resources to formulate a sense of nationhood. Associates of Ramakrishna styled themselves as \u2018the Army of the Mother\u2019 and spoke of establishing her reign throughout the land. They began to associate the territory of the Indian motherland with the volatile presence of the Mother goddess herself. Poets, playwrights and artists retold popular myths about the divine Mother, impregnating them with modern political meanings and new emotional significance.\nFor example, according to one Tantric myth, Shiva, the god of destruction, was humiliated by his father-in-law, King Daksha, when neither he nor his wife Sati were invited to a royal fire sacrifice (yajna). Sati insisted on attending and when Shiva tried to stop her, she exploded in fury, overwhelming her husband with her 10 powerful manifestations (Mahavidya or Great Wisdom goddesses). Sati then went to Daksha\u2019s sacrifice alone whereupon he again insulted her until she leapt into the flames. On hearing of Sati\u2019s suicide Shiva was so grief-stricken that he broke into the sacrificial arena, took his wife\u2019s corpse on his shoulders and began to annihilate the entire universe with his terrifying dance of destruction. Finally, Vishnu, the god of preservation, hurled his discus at Sati\u2019s lifeless body and sliced it into 51 pieces, which rained down across the subcontinent.\nAt each of these sites, known as Shakti Pithas (Seats of Power), Tantric practitioners worshiped different dismembered parts of the goddess\u2019 body, tapping into her sacred energy. For early Bengali patriots like Bhudev Mukhopadhyay (1827\u201394) these \u2018places of pilgrimage\u2019 articulated the idea of India as a distinctive and unified body, or motherland.\nIn Tantra the Mahavidyas play a central role as symbols of divine power to be used as aids for spiritual awakening.\nThe Mahavidyas, published by the Calcutta Art Studio. Chromolithograph, Kolkata, Bengal, India, about 1895. Funded by the Brooke Sewell Permanent Fund.\nThe many faces of motherhood\nThe Mahavidyas provided the Bengali middle-classes with a visual means to reimagine the various conditions of the motherland that the uneducated classes could instantly understand \u2013 the widow goddess Dhumavati, for instance, was deployed as a sorrowful representation of India as a \u2018begging mother\u2019 (Bharat Bhiksha), toothless and haggard, ravaged by the regular famines that British economic policies had inflicted on the nation.\nDhumavati and Matangi, published by the Calcutta Art Studio. Lithograph, Kolkata, Bengal, India, about 1885\u201390.\nIn one influential play Dhumavati (left) attempts to awaken her sleeping sons with sorrowful tales of her plight.\nIn stark contrast to this poignant figure of loss, the novelist Bankim Chandra Chatterjee (1838\u201394) imagined the motherland as she one day would be, restored to an ideal state of abundance. His nationalist hymn, Bande Mataram, personified Bengal as a source of maternal strength (shakti) for her disciplined sons, and domesticated her within stable territorial boundaries. Indeed, many plays and poems of the period used the Sati myth to reimagine Shiva as the heroic redeemer of the lifeless motherland. In these versions the dynamic, masculine patriot held together the fragmented corpse of the nation and, in some interpretations, secured India\u2019s missionary role in the world as the nation best equipped to unite the multiple shards of cultural truth from throughout the empire.\nCalcutta Art Studio, Shiva and Sati, hand-coloured lithograph, 1880s. \u00a9 Collection of Mark Baron and Elise Boisante.\nInverting the more familiar Kali-Shiva pairing, this melancholy icon of Shiva bearing Sati became a template for the ideal revolutionary sannyasi (ascetic) of the period.\nThe great mother of death\nTantra\u2019s macabre associations made it a useful framework with which to render India as a smouldering cremation ground (bharat-shmashan), a space of dereliction inhabited by the half-dead and the abject. But just as Tantra often reflected on death to bring the urgency of life more vividly into focus, its uncanny symbolism enabled the colonised to cultivate militant dreams of revolutionary transformation.\nOne poem presents the Tantric shava sadhana (corpse ritual) which requires the heroic practitioner (vira) to sit upon a fresh corpse in a cremation ground on a moonless night, calling upon Kali to take away his fear: \u2018India is an endless cremation ground\u2026 Meditate on great power (Mahashakti) in the vira pose.\u2019 The nation is haunted by Kali\u2019s fearsome presence, \u2018thirsting for hot, fresh blood\u2019 and inviting the immanent destruction of the unjust colonial order. Tantric poetry like this sanctioned a perilous level of militancy under the protective guise of traditional religious practice but, though it played on British paranoia, it was difficult to suppress since it did not identify an explicit enemy.\nIn 1907 British unease was further provoked by this advert for Swadeshi \u2018Kali Cigarettes\u2019, published by the Calcutta Arts Studio at a time of political instability. Herbert Hope Risley was especially anxious that Kali seemed to be garlanded with European heads and was spurred by such images to draft the 1910 Press Act.\nPopular print of the goddess Kali, published by the Calcutta Art Studio. Lithograph, Kolkata, Bengal, India, about 1885\u201395.\nBut it was Viceroy Lord Curzon\u2019s attempt to partition Bengal in 1905 that truly set the stage for the most threatening eruptions of Tantric terrorism. Inspired by the Irish uprisings and the South African Boers, young Bengalis turned to guerrilla tactics to combat the seemingly invulnerable British empire with its superior military resources. Guided by the political theology of the Bengali thinker Aurobindo Ghose (1872\u20131950), many organised underground secret societies, styling themselves as revolutionary sannyasis (ascetics) and undergoing esoteric initiation rites before idols of Kali in cremation grounds, as they vowed to sacrifice their lives for the liberation of the motherland.\nShodashi and Chinnamasta, published by the Calcutta Art Studio. Lithograph, Kolkata, Bengal, India, about 1885\u201390.\nThe headless Mahavidya Chinnamasta was another favourite form of the divine mother among Bengali radicals for whom she represented the rejuvenating force of revolutionary violence and heroic self-sacrifice.\nRecruits studied the Russian anarchist Nicholas Safranski\u2019s explosives manual alongside the Chandi, a devotional poem in praise of a demon-slaying aspect of the Divine Mother. Revolutionary pamphlets legitimised violence among the wider public by invoking Ma (Mother) Kali\u2019s bloodthirsty appetites and her desire for the sacrifice of \u2018white goats\u2019, a coded reference to Englishmen. While guns were difficult to obtain, explosives could be created from scratch, making \u2018Ma Kali\u2019s bomb\u2019 (Kali Mai\u2019s boma) a more democratic way of bursting free from oppressive British rule.\nKali, originally published by K. P. Hazra. Chromolithograph, India, 1917.\n\u00a9 British Library.\nThis image of Kali standing over Shiva was used as the frontispiece to James Campbell Ker\u2019s Political Trouble in India, 1907\u20131917, a confidential report on the emergence of the revolutionary movement.\nThe daredevil methods of these young revolutionaries played a critical role in establishing the idea of freedom in the popular consciousness and, in 1911, even compelled the British to transfer their capital to Delhi. But their movement was ultimately undermined by its overreliance on the vanguardist actions of an ethical elite rather than encouraging mass participation. Tantric rhetoric proved more adaptable in the hands of later activists, as in the case of the Muslim socialist poet Kazi Nazrul Islam (1899\u20131976), who powerfully reframed revolutionary struggle around the agency of women, workers and peasants. In one popular poem he calls upon women to emulate Kali: \u2018Rise up women, ignite your flame\u2026 dance your mad, naked dance\u2026 and awaken your power to burn the world.\u2019\nEven after independence, when the Naxalite (Maoist) militants of Bengal revolted in the 1970s against entrenched upper-class feudalism and capitalist exploitation, their pursuit of an ideal \u2018revolutionary personality\u2019 was nourished by Tantra. For the movement\u2019s chief thinker, Charu Mazumdar (1919\u201372): \u2018One who does not\u00a0dip his hand\u00a0in the\u00a0blood\u00a0of the class enemy is not a revolutionary.\u2019\nIn times of instability, revolutionary dreams and desires have often constellated around the anarchic figure of Kali, the promise of transformation never too far behind.\nFind\u00a0out\u00a0more\u00a0about Tantra:\u00a0enlightenment\u00a0to\u00a0revolution\u00a0here.\nSupported by the Bagri Foundation\nBuy the beautifully illustrated book accompanying the exhibition.\nFeaturing masterpieces of sculpture, painting, prints and ritual objects."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-great-court/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Everything you ever wanted to know about the Great Court", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2020-12-04 00:00:00", "text": "The Great Court was opened 20 years ago, on 6 December 2000, by Her Majesty The Queen.

Photo: Nigel Young, Foster + Partners\nRaising the roof\n2.\nWithout a doubt, the most impressive feature of the Great Court is the tessellating glass roof which covers the space. Engineered by Buro Happold to a design by Foster + Partners, and built by Waagner-Biro, the 3,312 individual panels of glass are held together by four miles of steel! And there\u2019s enough glass up there to glaze around 500 household greenhouses.\n\u2018Raising the roof\u2019 captured the imaginations of many who got involved with our fundraising campaign. Every pane in the ceiling of the Great Court is a donation from visitors and Members. Many of these donations were made in memory or honour of a loved one. The campaign lives long in the memories and hearts of these people, with families continuing to take a moment to remember when they look up to the roof.\nConstruction of the Great Court Roof.\nAlthough the roof looks airy and light, as if it\u2019s floating above the Great Court like a net, covering 6,100 square metres is no mean feat and the whole thing is mind-bogglingly heavy. The 315 tonnes of glass that make up the roof are supported by a 478-tonne steel structure \u2013 in total, that\u2019s equivalent to seven-and-a-half blue whales.\nConstruction of the Great Court roof from a raised platform inside the courtyard.\n3.\nSo that the roof can move naturally, and respond to changes in temperature as well as the weight of snow, it\u2019s attached to the courtyard\u2019s perimeter walls with sliding bearings \u2013 a clever piece of engineering that allows it to expand or contract instead of cracking. The Great Court can also get dark when the roof is covered in snow, so floodlights are fixed around the top of the Round Reading Room, illuminating the space.\nSnow that has settled on the Great Court roof, and the floodlights around the reading room illuminating the space.\n4.\nIt takes about two weeks to clean the whole roof.\nIt gets cleaned every three months as, being in the centre of London, it gets very dirty. The cleaners need a head for heights, and must be light on their feet \u2013 you can\u2019t walk unaided on the roof \u2013 instead you have to be hooked on by a harness to a network of cables that run over the it, which can\u2019t be seen from below.\nCleaners suspended on a network of cables, cleaning the roof with brushes.\n5.\nThe roof stands 26.3m above the floor at its highest point \u2013 that\u2019s nearly as tall as six of London\u2019s famous double-decker buses! These dizzying heights mean we can display some of the tallest objects in the collection \u2013 including the 12-metre-tall Haida totem pole from Kayang, Haida Gwaii, Canada and the 8-metre-tall Nisga\u2019a totem pole from the Nass River, British Columbia, Canada.

Just two years after the completion of Robert Smirke\u2019s grand Greek Revival building in the early 1850s, Charles Barry, joint architect of the Palace of Westminster, proposed roofing over the courtyard with sheets of glass supported on 50 iron pillars. This new space, inspired by the famous Crystal Palace of 1851, was to have served as a Hall of Antiquities, but never came to fruition.\nA 19th-century print showing the inner courtyard (now the Great Court).\n10.\nIn the original Robert Smirke design for the Museum, the central space within the quadrangle of buildings was supposed to be a garden and an open courtyard for promenading, as shown in this 19th-century print. However, from 1852 lots of bookstacks were built in the space and, along with the Round Reading Room, it became the home of the Museum\u2019s library department.\n11.\nAfter the library relocated to the new British Library building in Kings Cross in 1997, an architectural competition to redesign the Museum\u2019s courtyard space was launched with three aims \u2013 to reveal hidden spaces, revise old spaces and create new spaces. With more than 130 entries, the eventual winner was Foster + Partners.\n12.\nThe \u00a3100 million project was generously supported through public funding and private grants, with the Millennium Commission, The Garfield Weston Foundation and the National Lottery Heritage Fund as Principal Benefactors. The enduring contribution of these supporters and many more donors is immeasurable, and we are grateful to those who continue to support the Museum today.\nPhilippa Charles, Director, Garfield Weston Foundation said, \u2018The Garfield Weston Foundation is delighted to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Queen Elizabeth II Great Court with the British Museum. Over the course of a 25-year partnership rooted in a shared commitment to heritage, education, and public engagement, the Foundation has supported strategic initiatives at the Museum reaching millions of people from across the UK and around the world. The Foundation Trustees gave the lead donation towards the creation of the Great Court knowing that it would unlock substantial matched funding, and made the project possible. The iconic courtyard has transformed the Museum by placing visitors and education at its heart, and we are thrilled that our support continues to make the collection, research, and scholarship more widely accessible.\u2019\nA crane elevated over the roof of the Great Court.\n13.\nOn completion, the redesign grew the Museum by 40%.

Over the course of these difficult months, they have successfully navigated our online database, identifying objects that can be used to explore the experiences of D/deaf, disabled and neurodiverse people throughout history.\nThis has been difficult, not least because the history of disability is often \u2018hidden\u2019 within museum databases. The connections that objects have to disability themes may not be made clear in existing catalogue records, and several of the objects are described using medicalised, outdated, and sometimes problematic language that we now feel uncomfortable with.\nAlthough this preliminary research is simply the tip of the iceberg (the British Museum collection houses over 8,000,000 objects!), the work that has been done is a wonderful starting point for future research seeking to improve the way disability and neurodiversity is represented in the Museum.\nDuring 2021, a variety of research projects about disability histories within the collection will be kick-started, including my own fieldwork for my PhD. Our intention is that this research will grow and help inform future displays, exhibitions and public events. Here we share some highlights from what we found over the last few months.\nEmma Brown, University of Sussex\nCartonnage Big toe, Egpyt, before 600 BC\nWorn over 2,600 years ago in ancient Egypt, this prosthetic big toe shows signs of use. It would have assisted the wearer with balance, but also had an aesthetic purpose, and even has a place for a fake toenail to be inserted.\nThis prosthesis is in the shape of the big toe of the right foot, and has a number of holes around the edge through which it could be sewn onto something else (perhaps a sock or a sandal strap). It is made of cartonnage \u2013a material composed of layers of linen mixed with animal glue and gesso, also used to make mummy cases and masks.\nAt first glance this prosthetic toe didn\u2019t appear very old, but I was amazed and delighted to learn that this Egyptian prosthetic was made nearly 3,000 years ago. I\u2019m particularly interested in this object not only for its functional use, but also for its aesthetic appeal, which gives us an insight into the life and status of the wearer. Functionally, the prosthetic toe provided balance for its wearer.\nAesthetically, the toe was tailored to its wearer, even including a place for a fake toenail to complete the look. It also shows signs of being worn fairly often, implying that the wearer seemed happy with their prosthetic.\nBarbara Gomes-Artilheiro, University of Sussex\nTwo studies for the Conversion of St Paul, around 1657\u201358, by Nicolas Poussin (1594\u20131665)\nThese drawings by French artist Nicolas Poussin potentially show the impact syphilis and its associated tremors had on the artist\u2019s work.\nNicolas Poussin was a French Baroque painter. He spent most of his life in Rome, specialising in history paintings. It is said that Poussin fell ill in 1630 and recovered, however, his health declined once again in 1650, at which point tremors become visible in his drawings \u2013 as is the case here. It is believed the artist had syphilis and refused to get treatment for his illness.\nWhen I first started this project, I wasn\u2019t quite sure where to begin my research, because I had never really been involved in this kind of work and wasn\u2019t very familiar with the subject either. After trying a few different keywords in the search bar of Collection online, and exploring them, this was one of the first works that captivated me.\nHere, we see evidence of an artist who had an illness, or possibly age-related impairment, that clearly affected his drawing and painting. It\u2019s such a captivating piece because we get a glimpse of Poussin\u2019s experience of illness through his artwork.\nGabriel Seck, University of Leicester\nPrint of Peter and John at the gate of the temple, around 1629\u201330, by Rembrandt (1606\u201369)\nThis etching shows Saint Peter and Saint John performing a miracle.\nMade by Rembrandt in the 17th century, this print shows the Biblical scene of Peter\u2019s miraculous healing of a man who sits outside a temple\u2019s gates. The description of this work uses language drawn from the translation of a Bible passage (King James Bible, Acts 3). This passage describes the man as a \u2018cripple\u2019, a term which today is regarded as old-fashioned and offensive as it has often been used in a derogatory and oppressive manner. As part of my research I have been logging potentially problematic or outdated language found on the Collection online database.\nA common theme throughout disabled history, is the idea of \u2018the cure\u2019.\nThis etching by Rembrandt follows common depictions in Christian artwork, where a powerful divine or holy figure takes \u2018pity\u2019 on a disabled person and \u2018cures\u2019 them. These images and ideas have shaped modern attitudes to disabled people.\nThe idea of the cure in contemporary culture is controversial and debated in the disabled community, as many find the idea that they need to be \u2018cured\u2019 offensive. Some, however, who suffer from chronic pain for example, may very much wish for a cure. It is important to consider the illness identity of the person. For my own illness identity, a cure is wanted desperately by many, but this is not applicable to everyone with the same disease.\nThough the idea of the \u2018cure\u2019 or \u2018healing\u2019 that Rembrandt depicts makes some people uneasy and uncomfortable today, it is important not to erase these types of works from disabled history. It is important to critique works like this and not hide the oppression (or the victories) from the community \u2013 this way we can show how far my community has come, while also showing where we came from.\nIsabelle Lawrence, CDP student, British Museum\nPrint and drawing of The Old Commodore, around 1824\u201333, by William Fairland (fl. 1828\u20131935), and George Scharf (1788\u20131860)\nTwo depictions of the Old Commodore of Tottenham Court Road, with a brush and holding out a hat for money. Tottenham Court Road is a main road in central London very close to the Museum. On the left, a print by William Fairland, and on the right a drawing by George Scharf.\nI have chosen this print of a man dubbed The Old Commodore of Tottenham Court Road. The print depicts a black man wearing a prosthetic leg, holding his top hat in front of his chest and resting his other hand on a broom handle. Although another image of the same man, this time a drawing by George Scharf in 1835, can also be found in the collection, our collections database holds very little information on who the Old Commodore was or about his experience. This is something I am keen to address.\nThis print has the potential to spark new avenues of future research. For example, the Old Commodore appears to be a crossing sweeper (whose role was to sweep refuse from the streets of London) and may be holding out his hat as a means of asking for money. This makes this print one of many images in the collection of (often unnamed) impaired men and women in similar, low paid occupations or impoverished situations. However, this man is given a title which sets him apart. Images like this often capitalised on the local fame of individuals whose physical differences were promoted as spectacles or curiosities. A Commodore is a high-ranking Officer in the Royal Navy, perhaps indicating that the man in this print had a sea-faring past that was known to those who dubbed him (for whatever reason) the Old Commodore.\nIt is important to remember that the Old Commodore was living in a time of great social change. The Slave Trade Act 1807 prohibited the slave trade in the British Empire, but slavery remained legal throughout most of the Empire until the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833. This was also a time when the British Empire was expanding, affecting the distribution of power within colonised countries and the growth of racism and racial stereotypes.\nThe questions that this print raises are endless. Who was the Old Commodore? How did colonialism, imperialism and constructions of race and social class shape his life and what does this tell us about the British Empire? How did his impairment affect his life? How much control did he have over the way he was represented, and what did the producers of this image hope to achieve? How would this image have been interpreted to those examining (or staring) at it, and why it was eventually collected by the British Museum? What could this image mean for audiences today, who have been shaped by the civil rights movements of the 20th and 21st centuries?\nMany of these questions require further research \u2013 and some may be unanswerable, but it is important that they are asked. In 2021 a series of collaborative workshops will explore the histories of some of these objects, and this object is therefore a perfect example of the way in which the work of each of the students could act as a springboard for future research.\nJessica Starns, Volunteer Coordinator, British Museum\nThomas the Tank Engine Badge, 2003\nThis Thomas the Tank Engine pin badge is part of the Coins and Medals collection, and can help demonstrate how language and attitudes around autism have changed. On the card just below the pin badge is an old logo for the National Autistic Society, which shows a drawing of a child crying within a jigsaw puzzle piece. This old logo used in the early 2000s might suggest that autistic people are a puzzle that needs to be solved, that they are on their own and are isolated from the rest of society.\nOn the back of the card there\u2019s text about autism and the charity. The language is now outdated and isn\u2019t how the National Autistic Society would describe autism today. They used person-first language (\u2018with autism\u2019) rather than identity first language (\u2018autistic person\u2019). In the 17 years since this badge was created our understanding of autism has changed significantly as autistic people have had greater opportunity to share their experiences.\nIn 2001 the National Autistic Society researched whether autistic children have a stronger connection to Thomas the Tank Engine than other children\u2019s characters. This may be why, in 2003, they created this badge to raise funds for the charity. In 2007 the Society published a survey on how Thomas & Friends support the education of autistic children to learn emotions, numbers, words and colours. The survey found that facial expressions of Thomas characters are easier to read and were enjoyed because the narrator clearly explains the storyline. In 2017 Thomas & Friends introduced their first identifying autistic character \u2013 Theo \u2013 in the film Thomas & Friends: Journey Beyond Sodor.\nI selected this object as I am neurodivergent and as a child liked Thomas the Tank Engine. I was lucky to live near a heritage railway in Sussex which had an old steam train designed to look like Thomas, which I used to visit regularly with my family. I feel this object is important in showing how language and people\u2019s perception of autism is changing positively.\nFiona Slater, Equality and Diversity Manager, British Museum\nRescue, 2018, by Mohammad Barrangi (b. 1988)\nMohammed Barrangi\u2019s work is informed by his lived experience of exile and disability. The woman\u2019s face in this work is that of the artist\u2019s mother.\nThe British Museum continues to acquire new objects and artworks for the collection. Last year a work by Iranian artist Mohammad Barrangi was acquired by the Middle East Department, and is included in a new publication Reflections: contemporary art of the Middle East and North Africa (exhibition coming 2021). Barrangi\u2019s work draws from the aesthetic of Persian miniature painting, and is informed by his lived experience of exile and disability. As he highlights in his artist statement on the Museum website:\n\u2018As a disabled artist, I like to show images of people who are missing arms or other limbs, or have another disability, and show them in a new way. I aim to depict women who I admire or who are inspirational to me. I often use images of my mother for instance, exiled Iranian queens or just friends who have meant a lot to me. My work often focuses on journeys and travelling. Sometimes I will also combine elements from classical Western paintings with Eastern stories or imagery.\u2019\nI have met and worked with Mohammad Barrangi so was delighted to hear the Museum had acquired his work for the collection. I love his unusual use of collage and Iranian brushwork, which often transforms his contemporaries into historic creatures of myth and legend.\nHave you found an object in the collection which you think has a link to disability history or narratives?

For it is a neat and clean city, the people are good-natured, and, on top of that, ample gold and silver circulates. No wonder it is a good place to live\u2019. Hata Ginkei (1790\u20131870), Chimata no uwasa (Rumours Around Town), 1835.\nLocation\nOsaka is located in the central part of the Japanese archipelago, neighbouring the cities of Kyoto to the north and Nara to the east, and Kii province to the south. With a secure location and easy access to marine transport, Osaka has always been important. From the mid-seventh to late eighth centuries AD, imperial palaces were built here, and in the 1580s, the warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1537\u201398) established this as the site of his grand Osaka Castle.\nYoshimura Shuzan (1700\u20131776), Six-panel screen showing a bird\u2019s-eye view of the northern outskirts of Osaka. Ink, colour, and gold leaf on paper, 18th century.\nTo the west of the city, Osaka Bay connects to the Japanese inland sea, Seto-naikai. Osaka is a city of water. Many canals and bridges snake through the city, resulting in a distinctive landscape unlike other big Japanese cities. In recent times, the mouths of the rivers entering Osaka Bay have become heavily silted up, making it difficult for ships to moor.\nAkisato Rito (fl. 1780\u20131830), Settsu meisho zue (Illustrations of Famous Places in Settsu Province), showing boats docking in Osaka Bay at the mouth of the Ajigawa River. Woodblock-printed book, 1798.\nSo, the mouth of one of the main rivers, Ajigawa, has been dredged. You\u2019ll be surprised to see how much sand this project produced \u2013 enough to be officially classed as a good-sized mountain (although at 4.53m above sea level, it\u2019s Japan\u2019s smallest mountain)! Now called Tenp\u014d-zan, the mountain makes a popular destination for leisurely outings, especially when the cherry trees there are in bloom.\nKatsushika Hokusai (1760-1849), Settsu Ajigawa-guchi Tenpozan (Mt. Tenpo at the Mouth of the Aji River, Settsu). Colour woodblock print, c.1834.\nThe weather in Osaka is mild enough so you can enjoy a visit in the winter months to catch fabulous theatre performances. The summers can be very hot, but cooling off along the river in the evening is a popular pastime. If you want to catch the beautiful cherry blossoms, visiting in spring is recommended.\nTravel\nIf you have already been to Edo (modern-day Tokyo) or Kyoto, you may be familiar with the Eastern Sea Road (T\u014dkaid\u014d) which connects the two cities. Osaka is about 50km southwest of Kyoto. There is a good road for walking, but you will need to stay overnight at one of the station towns, else your legs will give way! If you\u2019re tired, you can hire a sedan chair (kago) for part of the way. Kago are carried by two men, one at the front and one at the back, but be careful not to be caught by rogue carriers, who might demand additional fees at the end of the journey. Alternatively, you can take a boat along the Yodo river, the artery connecting southern Kyoto and Osaka.\nAkatsuki no Kanenari (1793\u20131860), Yodogawa ryogan shokei zue (Excellent Views of Both Banks of the Yodo River). Woodblock printed book, 1824.\nA boat trip may be more costly than walking but is much easier. It will take you about half a day. Arriving at the boat terminal, Hachiken\u2019ya, you will already feel the energy of the bustling city.\nAkisato Rito (fl. 1780\u20131830), Settsu meisho zue (Illustrations of Famous Places in Settsu Province), showing a boat arriving and unloading at the boat terminal. Woodblock-printed, 1798.\nGetting around\nOsaka is lively and exciting \u2013 and walking is a good way to really experience the city. The city centre is easy to navigate as the streets are organised in a grid pattern \u2013 suji, the north-south streets, and t\u014dri, the east-west streets \u2013 accentuated by canals at regular intervals. As more than 90% of the city\u2019s population (about 350,000) are merchants and artisans, the general atmosphere is relaxed and friendly \u2013 you\u2019re not likely to encounter a samurai on the street.\nAoi Sokyu (1772\u20131859), Kishi enpu (Mr Aoi\u2019s Album of Charm), showing a higher-quality sedan chair. Woodblock-printed book, 1803\nIf you plan to go some distance, you can hire a simple sedan chair in town. You might sometimes see box-shaped, higher-quality kago with a proper roof, wall and a blind-covered window. Those belong exclusively to certain elite or wealthy households, and there are even regulations about which rank and status can ride which type.\nThings to do\nD\u014djima and Nakanoshima\nOsaka is Japan\u2019s centre of commerce and banking, and many goods, domestic or foreign (the latter entering through Nagasaki), are traded here.\nEven prestigious samurai households rely on Osaka\u2019s merchants to sell products from their domains \u2013 areas of land and a governing units entrusted to samurai lords. For a uniquely \u2018Osaka\u2019 experience, head to the north, at the edge of the city along the river, where there are two adjacent islands called D\u014djima and Nakanoshima. Here you\u2019ll find impressive rows of storehouses.\nThey belong to daimyo (samurai lord) households from all over Japan intending to store their yearly harvest \u2013 mainly rice and other grains \u2013 for later sale. When boats carrying a domain\u2019s rice arrive, male workers wearing only a loincloth appear as if from nowhere and start swiftly landing the load.\nAkisato Rito (fl. 1780-1830), Settsu meisho zue (Illustrations of Famous Places in Settsu Province), showing goods being unloaded from a boat, and stacked on the shore. Woodblock-printed book, 1798.\nThe contents of the straw bags are inspected and in no time they are in storage. It is impressive that the workmen appear to be able to easily carry a couple of full straw bags (weighing about 60kg each) at once!\nThe bustle during market periods is another impressive sight. From early morning until the afternoon, numerous rice buyers and sellers gather in D\u014djima, shouting and competing over what to buy, what to sell, and at what price. As negotiations heat up, many of the traders don\u2019t notice that the time is up, so officials will splash water around in order to forcibly disperse the crowd!\nAkisato Rito (fl. 1780-1830), Settsu meisho zue (Illustrations of Famous Places in Settsu Province), showing officials dispersing crowds with water. Woodblock-printed book, 1798.\nThe price of rice of course depends on natural conditions each year and fluctuates, sometimes wildly. The Osaka market price determines the nationwide economy, as both the salary of the ruling samurai class and the scale of their property are calculated in the koku unit of rice (1 koku is about 180 litres).\nZakoba\nIf you like the liveliness of markets, you may want to visit the fish market in Zakoba. It sits towards the western edge of town, where canals pour into the Ajigawa river.\nAkisato Rito (fl. 1780-1830), Settsu meisho zue (Illustrations of Famous Places in Settsu Province), showing a crowded fish market. Woodblock-printed book, 1798.\nDue to its location, Osaka is blessed with ample sea produce. Itinerant fishmongers generally are high-spirited, robust fellows, but a visitor from Edo mentioned the other day that Osaka fishmongers appear much politer and more \u2018elegant\u2019 than their counterparts in Edo, since they wear an apron over their tucked-up kimono, not leaving their undergarment visible. How customs differ in each city!\nShitenn\u014d-ji Temple\nThe southeast quarter is the temple district, where there are hundreds of Buddhist temples big and small, and also some shrines. In the largest precinct stands Shitenn\u014d-ji Temple, one of Japan\u2019s oldest temples, believed to have been established at the end of the sixth century by Prince Sh\u014dtoku (AD 574\u2013622), an early supporter of the Buddhist faith. You will see the distinctive layout of the buildings, with the southern gates, Five-Storey Pagoda, Golden Hall and Lecture Hall all lined up on the north-south axis in the centre of the precinct, showing a direct influence from the Asian continent. It really is a sight to behold, and you\u2019re free to explore the temples as you wish.\nAkisato Rito (fl. 1780-1830), Settsu meisho zue (Illustrations of Famous Places in Settsu Province), showing the Shitenno-ji Temple precinct. Woodblock-printed book, 1798.\nOsaka Castle\nIf you want to see how the upper echelons of society live, you\u2019ll find that samurai of the ruling class reside around Osaka Castle at the northeast edge of the city. You can see the castle\u2019s turrets from a distance and, if you approach the area, the impressively tall stone walls surrounding the castle will surely inspire awe. Today, the castle is rarely used by the shogun, but it is still heavily guarded by his trusted subjects. So it is not really advisable to be seen wandering around it.\nEntertainment\nWhen in Osaka, you must not miss seeing Bunraku and Kabuki theatre. Bunraku is puppet theatre, accompanied by powerful j\u014druri chanting and strumming on the three-stringed shamisen .\nYamaguchi Soken (1759\u20131818), Yamato jinbutsu gafu (Picture Album of Japanese People), showing a joruri chanter and a shamisen player. Woodblock-printed book, 1800.\nYou may have heard the name of one of Japan\u2019s greatest playwrights, Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653\u20131725). He wrote many Bunraku plays as well as Kabuki, and some of his plays such as The Love Suicides at Sonezaki (Sonezaki shinj\u016b) and The Battles of Coxinga (Kokusen\u2019ya kassen) are still popular today. It takes three puppeteers \u2013 left, right and centre \u2013 to perform one puppet, whose every joint and facial feature is movable, in order to express all possible nuances of a character\u2019s emotions.\nTengu Hisa I (1858\u20131943), Puppet for the character of Osome, made from wood and cloth. Japan, 1942.\nIf you are really struck by the deep-voiced j\u014druri chanting, and feel like taking a lesson, amateur j\u014druri clubs are quite popular here. You will eventually be expected to take a turn performing, if you stay around long enough!\nKabuki theatre is the biggest entertainment, and the top actors are true stars. It is an all-male theatre, and female-role specialists (onnagata) dress as women even in their daily life. They wear a purple cloth on their forehead to cover the shaven area of hair that men customarily have.\nGigado Ashiyuki (1813\u20131834), A triptych of woodblock prints showing leading Kabuki actors with umbrellas on the snow-covered Aiaibashi bridge in Dotonbori, Osaka, 1825.\nD\u014dtonbori in the south of the city is the theatre district. The major theatres are Kado-za and Naka-za, which stand next to each other and are rivals in staging hit productions with famous actors. The 11th month in the lunar calendar (equivalent to December in the Gregorian calendar) is the most important month for the Kabuki theatre because that is when actors\u2019 new annual contracts with the theatre managers begin. The opening season performance with the new troupe is called kaomise ky\u014dgen, and has a particularly merry atmosphere.\nShunkosai Hokushu (fl. 1802\u20131832), Bust portrait of the kabuki actor Arashi Kichisaburo II reflected in a mirror, surrounded by wigs and hats from his famous roles. Colour woodblock print, 1821\nThe top actors you should check out at present are Arashi Kichisabur\u014d II, the handsome male lead-role (tachiyaku), known for his lovely almond eyes, and Nakamura Utaemon III, the pop-eyed all-round star, who also performs in the city of Edo, where he is popular too.\nShunkosai Hokushu (fl. 1802\u20131832), Bust portrait of the actor Nakamura Utaemon III as Kato Masakiyo. Colour woodblock print, 1820.\nIn and around Kabuki theatres, you may see groups of people wearing matching clothing and peculiar rectangular hats, especially at the start of a new theatrical season. They are members of Kabuki fan clubs, and devout fans to their core. They send gifts to the troupe for the new season and attend performances together. When the actor they support comes out on stage to greet the audience, they start to sing (each group has its own song), beating wooden clappers to the rhythm. Osaka Kabuki fan clubs are well known for their zeal and dedication.\nGigado Ashiyuki (fl. 1813\u20131834), The Kabuki actor Seki Sanjuro bowing onstage, and fans standing nearby with clappers. Colour woodblock print, 1826.\nWhere to stay\nFor travellers with deep pockets, head to the left-bank of the Yodo river, along the Tosa-bori moat, where there are up-market restaurants and a hotel district . You can find exquisite service in this area but, please be aware, the price tag here reflects the clientele.\nNorth of the D\u014dtonbori theatre district, right in the city centre, is the biggest shopping district \u2013 Junkei-machi \u2013 along the street running east-west. You can find virtually everything here, from clothes, footwear and accessories, to food, kitchen utensils, household tools and ceramics. Numerous shops are squeezed into this one street, and it is always crowded with shoppers and browsers.\nUtagawa Hiroshige (1797\u20131858), Junkei-machi yomise no zu (Evening market scene in Junkei district, Osaka). Colour woodblock print, 1835.\nAt the west end of this high street is the bridge to enter the Shinmachi district. Similar to Yoshiwara in Edo and Shimabara in Kyoto, Shinmachi is the officially licensed brothel district, isolated somewhat from the surrounding areas by enclosed walls and ditches. Unless you have plenty of money, Shinmachi may not be for you, but if you have a chance to peek at the grand procession of a courtesan (high-ranked sex worker) walking from the house of her employer to the restaurant where her client awaits, you will understand why an evening\u2019s entertainment with her and her entourage is so expensive.\nNishiyama Kan\u2019ei (1833\u20131897), A courtesan procession in spring, from a handscroll of life in Osaka. Ink and colour on paper, 19th century.\nFood and drink\nYou may have heard it said that Osaka is the \u2018nation\u2019s kitchen\u2019 (tenka no daidokoro).\nAll kinds of goods go through Osaka. Thanks to its location close to the sea and mountains, Osaka never suffers from a shortage of good food. What makes Osaka\u2019s cuisine particularly sophisticated is the use of dashi (umami-packed stock). Dried bonito from the neighbouring Kii province to the south and kelp from the land of Ezo in the far north, make the perfect dashi as a base for various dishes. Good-quality, locally-sourced soy sauce and salt are also available. From casual dining to fancy foods, the choice is yours!\nThe names of dishes in Osaka may sometimes appear perplexing to visitors. For example, you may see on a menu outside a small restaurant a dish called kashi-wan, meaning \u2018sweets bowl.\u2019 This is not a dessert, but rather sea bream fillet, a slice of steamed fish cake and shiitake mushrooms cooked in a clear savoury soup.\nHasegawa Sadanobu I (1809\u20131879), Masui no shimizu, showing the fresh water well in Masui and a grand restaurant. Colour woodblock print, 1869\u20131871.\nGetting fresh water is a bit of a problem in the city centre. Well water is too briny to drink, but you can buy fresh water from street vendors if you have cash. Otherwise, you can get fresh water for free from the well in Masui, just to the west of Shitenn\u014dji Temple. Thanks to the quality of the water springs, excellent restaurants prosper there, and you can find grand two-storey establishments.\nHasegawa Sadanobu I (1809\u20131879), Fukumoto Sushi, from the series Naniwa jiman meibutsu zukushi (Pride of Naniwa: Famous Osaka Products). Colour woodblock print, 1864\u20131865.\nBeing on the coast, sushi is a must. The recently opened sushi shop, Fukumoto Sushi, is becoming hugely popular. The appearance of their sushi may not be what you expect. It comes in a box, with sliced fillets of abalone, sea bream or a plain omelette on a bed of rice seasoned with salt, sugar and vinegar, eaten with Japanese sansh\u014d pepper and ginger. It is not expensive, but it\u2019s a delicious treat. It is so popular that people \u2013 even the locals \u2013 fight to buy it! Visiting the shop early in the day is recommended.\nIn Osaka, you can taste the best sake in Japan. This is because not only is the highest-quality clear sake produced in Itami, just across the Yodo river, but also this sake has to pass through Osaka to be transported to Edo via the eastbound sea route.\nShitomi Kangetsu (1747\u20131797), Nippon sankai meisan zue, showing the production of sake in Itami. Woodblock-printed book, 1799.\nItami sake is prized by the elites in Edo, including the shogun himself, because it is clear and clean, unlike the cloudy sake that is more typical. Nowadays you can find about 200 brands of Itami \u2013 Hoshi no I (Starry Well), Tanch\u014d-sui (Cranes\u2019 Elixir) or Wakatake (Young Bamboo), for example\n\u2013 which one appeals to you?\nVarious artists, Banka jinmei roku (Who\u2019s Who from Myriad Houses), showing different brands of Itami sake in their containers. Woodblock-printed book, 1813.\nReligion\nOsaka is renowned for the summer festivals (natsu matsuri) of the shrines. The season runs from the late sixth month to early seventh month (about late July to early August in the Gregorian calendar). It takes weeks to complete the whole set of religious services at each shrine, but the highlights of the festivals are the couple of days when people in the community participate in the celebration and onlookers gather to see the lively parades.\nAkisato Rito (fl. 1780-1830), Settsu meisho zue (Illustrations of Famous Places in Settsu Province), showing the procession of a summer festival float. Woodblock-printed book, 1798.\nOne of the famous summer festivals is at the Sumiyoshi Taisha Shrine. The Shrine is quite far south of the city centre, but it is worth a half-day trip. It boasts large green premises which enshrine deities blessing safe sea travel, proficiency in poetry composition and abundant harvests. These deities have been venerated by high and low alike since ancient times.\nKubo Shunman (1757\u20131820), Sumiyoshi Shrine and the legend of Hakurakuten (Bai Juyi).

Jamie) first visited the archaeological site of Khirbet Um al-Ghozlan in the north of Jordan, I dismissed it as nothing more than an ancient farming village. Arabic for the \u2018Ruins of the Mother of the Gazelles\u2019, the site sits on a small knoll above the steep-sided Wadi (Valley) Rayyan. The slopes are covered in oak forests, wild flowers and olive groves. You can see west to the Jordan Rift Valley (200m below sea level) and east to the Transjordan plateau (rising 1400m above sea level in the distance). The view is spectacular.\nKhirbet Um al-Ghozlan in the Wadi Rayyan, Jordan. Photo by Bashar Tabbah.\nArchaeologists would normally classify the site as a rural farming village because of its size. Only one acre (0.4ha) in area, Khirbet Um al-Ghozlan could easily fit into the Great Court at the British Museum and still leave room for the coffee shops. It was also occupied in a time of urban collapse, at the end of the Early Bronze Age (2600\u20132000 BC). During this period, people in the southern Levant (modern-day Jordan, Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories) abandoned their cities and dispersed into small, rural communities. \u201cNothing special\u201d, I mused as I walked back to the car, \u201cat least the view was nice\u201d.\nSo imagine my surprise when I stumbled across a constructed line of massive stone boulders hidden by the long grass. With mounting excitement I followed them around the entire knoll, slowly realising they formed a monumental enclosure wall protecting the site. This didn\u2019t make sense: in the Bronze Age world, walls were built to fortify large urban centres, not tiny rural hamlets. What had motivated people 4,500 years ago to defend such a remote site?\nAn ancient olive oil factory\nBack at the British Museum I sought out Dr Caroline Cartwright in her microscopy lab in the Department of Scientific Research. As an archaeobotanist, Caroline has spent decades studying the relationship between people and their environment by analysing ancient plant remains. She was the perfect person to discuss one possible explanation for the site\u2019s mysterious defensive wall- that it protected a Bronze Age olive oil factory.\nThe hills of the Wadi Rayyan, Jordan. Photo by Bashar Tabbah.\nThe key, I suggested, lay in the site\u2019s upland location. The well-drained slopes of the Wadi Rayyan are ideal for cultivating olive trees, especially compared to the flood-prone Jordan Valley floor where their woody roots tend to rot. If Khirbet Um al-Ghozlan served as an olive oil factory and storehouse, then maybe ancient farmers enclosed it to protect their seasonal stockpiles of olive oil \u2013 one of the most precious commodities in the Bronze Age. \u201cDon\u2019t think of it like a permanent settlement behind a formal fortification wall\u201d, I said, bouncing on my stool, \u201cmore like a bank-vault in the landscape, where people stashed their olive oil during the month-long harvest\u201d. Caroline raised an eyebrow, agreed it was a reasonable idea, then responded with sharp scientific acumen: \u201cbut where\u2019s the evidence? We need archaeological data to prove it\u201d.\nWe needed to dig. And so, with permission from the Jordanian Department of Antiquities, a joint team from the British Museum/University of Sydney undertook excavations at Khirbet Um al-Ghozlan in March 2017 and November 2019. Three Jordanian archaeologists joined us from the Department of Antiquities, and we employed ten men from the local village to help.\nThe origins of olive oil\nScene depicting the olive harvest in Greece by the Antimenes Painter. Attic black-figure amphora, Greece, around 520 BC.\nThe story of olive oil starts around 6000 BC, when people in the eastern Mediterranean learned how to extract oil from the bitter fruit growing on wild olive trees. By 5000 BC, people were cultivating domestic trees in orchards. Olive oil quickly transformed the way people lived: it was burned as fuel in lamps; it helped preserve food longer, especially dairy products such as yoghurt and cheese; and it enabled a broad cuisine to flourish, providing the foundations of what we know today as the \u2018Mediterranean diet\u2019.\nThe Middle East soon developed an international oil economy \u2013 albeit one based on the olive. The first cities in the southern Levant emerged between 3700\u20133000 BC, partly driven by trade with Egypt, where olive oil was prized as one of seven \u2018sacred oils\u2019 for embalming the dead. However, this fledgling urban experiment soon faltered and collapsed, possibly when Egyptian merchants shifted the oil trade north to ports in Syria and Lebanon. The southern cities were gradually abandoned and people disbursed into the countryside. This so-called \u2018Dark Age\u2019 marks the end of the Early Bronze Age (2600\u20132000 BC). It is to this period of urban recession that Khirbet Um al-Ghozlan dates.\nProducing modern olive oil\nTo test our hypothesis we needed to understand what the signatures of olive oil production would look like as archaeological remains. Although modern olive presses are mechanised, the stages involved in harvesting the fruit and extracting the oil have remained largely unchanged over the last 8,000 years. To learn more, we returned to Jordan in late 2019 to observe the annual harvest.\nHarvesting\nThe harvest occurs every October to November, usually after the first autumn rains have washed the summer dust from the ripening fruit. Farmers shake or rake the branches causing the fruit to fall onto sheets below. Groups of people remove twigs and leaves before gathering the olives in sacks.\nOlives being shaken from the tree (above) and sorted on the ground (below) in Jordan, November 2019. Photos by Adam Carr.\nCrushing\nThe sacks are taken to local olive factories that contain the pressing equipment. The fruit is emptied into a large basin and crushed by rotating mill-stones into a tapenade-like paste. A worker presses the paste onto circular fibrous mats, which are stacked high like pancakes onto a trolley ready to be pressed.\nMill-stones crushing olives in the Toubneh olive mill in Jordan, November 2019. Photo by Adam Carr.\nPressing\nTraditional olive presses used stone weights or screwed vices to apply pressure to the mats. Today, the stacked mats are pressed in a motorised steel vice, forcing the oil to exude in golden rivulets, which are drained into barrels or tins. Once the pressing is complete, the olive paste is scraped from the mats and collected for fertiliser or fuel.\nStoring\nAs oil collected from non-mechanised presses contains a significant proportion of water, oil was traditionally stored for several weeks in jars or vats in cool, dark storehouses to allow the oil and water to separate. The lighter oil was then scooped or decanted away. The process was complete.\nProducing ancient olive oil\nIf our hypothesis was correct, then excavations at Khirbet Um al-Ghozlan should yield archaeological evidence illustrating all stages of this process. The site did not disappoint. Strikingly, the monumental enclosure wall appears to have protected only two or three buildings, each containing several stone bins and storage installations. Were these compounds the storehouses used to cache oil jars accumulated throughout the harvest? Clues lay in the materials they contained.\nA partly-excavated storage compound at Khirbet Um al-Ghozlan. Orthophoto by Ehab al-Jariri.\nHarvesting\nThe most compelling evidence lay in the charred remains of ancient plant remains \u2013 known as the archaeobotanical record. Tiny fragments of charcoal found in the soil represent the remains of wood that people brought to the site to burn as fuel. Using a scanning electron microscope, Caroline identified the original tree species of each sample by examining its anatomical structure from different angles. We know from other excavations that people in Bronze Age farming villages typically burned a variety of wood species gathered from around the site. Not so at Khirbet Um al-Ghozlan. \u201cIt\u2019s quite extraordinary\u201d, Caroline observed, \u201cevery single sample is olive wood. They weren\u2019t burning anything else.\u201d\nThis pattern suggests that, like farmers today, Bronze Age people pruned their olive trees as part of the harvest and stockpiled the wood for fuel. The picture became clearer when Caroline discovered fragments of small shoots and suckers, usually removed during pruning to shape the tree.\nScanning electron microscope image of olive wood. Image by C R Cartwright.\nScanning electron microscope image of an olive sucker. Image by C R Cartwright.\nScanning electron microscope image of a crushed fragment of an olive stone. Image by C R Cartwright.\nThis inference tallied neatly with the discovery of several beautiful flint blades that may be the remains of ancient pruning saws. Known as Canaanean blades, these tools are about as long as your hand, from the base of your palm to the top of your middle finger \u2013 the perfect length for pruning slender olive branches. Each blade is serrated on both sides and notched at one end where they were hafted to a handle.\nAncient flint blades used as olive-pruning saws. Photo by Adam Carr.\nA modern metal olive-pruning saw. Photo by Adam Carr.\nCrushing\nBut the smoking gun was Caroline\u2019s discovery of miniscule fragments of crushed olive stones, known in Arabic as jift. These fragments are unambiguous by-products of olive oil production that prove olives had been crushed for oil at Khirbet Um al-Ghozlan. The fact they were charred indicates that, once pressed, the jift had been collected and burned as fuel, just as people burn jift as fuel today. Several limestone mortars excavated in and around the storehouses were probably used to crush the olives into paste.\nPressing\nThe crushed paste was probably pressed in one of six olive presses found hewn into the limestone bedrock nearby. Each comprised a rectangular basin into which mats laden with the crushed olive paste was pressed under heavy stones. The oil would flow through a circular channel into a storage jar nestled into a collection tank below.\nOlive press cut into limestone bedrock at Khirbet Um al-Ghozlan. Note the circular channel draining the oil from the pressing tank (top) to the collection vat (below). Photo by Adam Carr.\nStoring\nThe storage compounds themselves contained at least 23 storage jars lined up in several rooms. Although broken, Jordanian conservator Naif Zaban at The American Center of Research in Amman has been slowly restoring these jars to their original form. Remarkably, 83% of all pottery sherds were from storage jars. This is a strikingly high proportion, as we would normally expect other types of domestic vessels to be well represented, including cooking pots, bowls and jugs. We hope to analyse these jars for organic residues: if we can detect lipids associated with vegetable fats, then the jars probably contained olive oil \u2013 stayed tuned for updates! Although this last piece of the puzzle is still being researched, the evidence overwhelming points to a site for specialised industrial production rather than a typical farming village. Together, the plant remains, storage jars, olive presses and stone tools all support the theory that the site was used for the seasonal production of olive oil.\nArchaeologist Beau Spry excavating broken storage jars at Khirbet Um al-Ghozlan, Jordan, March 2017. Photo by Adam Carr.\nOlive oil and the city\nPerhaps the best analogy for understanding the site is the olive oil factories scattered through the hills of Jordan today. For 11 months of the year, these isolated structures are locked-up, silent and dark, their pressing equipment stored under plastic. Then, in mid-October, their doors are opened, their lights switched on, and they become some of the most dynamic places in the country, as farmers bring their olives to be pressed. The key question for us is where the people who visited Khirbet Um al-Ghozlan came from. Did they live in nearby villages, or did they venture to the uplands seasonally, from larger settlements on the Jordan Valley floor?\nArchaeologist Sarah Carter carefully excavating a broken storage jar in the back of the storage compound. Photo by Adam Carr.\nThe storehouses at Khirbet Um al-Ghozlan attest the timelessness of the olive oil industry. The sounds of the olive harvest have echoed through the hills for millennia, and genetic studies indicate that trees cultivated today are the descendants of those harvested in the Bronze Age. The modern olive harvest would certainly be familiar to someone from antiquity \u2013 a fixed point in an eternal agricultural cycle.\nFrom the earliest Neolithic villages to the modern international economy, we cannot understand the development of cultures in Jordan without understanding the role of olive oil. The excavations at Khirbet Um al-Ghozlan help articulate the close relationship between olive oil and the rise and fall of early urban societies. The site illuminates how a resilient olive industry maintained strong economic sinews during a period of urban collapse at the end of the third millennium BC. Indeed, many archaeologists believe it helped promote the recovery of urban societies in the early second millennium BC. This rejuvenated civilisation would come to be known as the \u2018Canaanites\u2019. Although later biblical texts would describe the Canaanites as occupants of a \u2018land of milk and honey\u2019, this sobriquet overlooks one of the most significant and enduring aspects of the region \u2013 that it was a land of olive oil as well.\nYou can hear Jamie talk about the excavations as part of the July edition of the British Museum\u2019s podcast series here.\nYou can read more about the project in online reports for the Palestine Exploration Fund and the American Schools of Research.\nAcknowledgements\nThe 2017 dig was funded by the Wainwright Fund (University of Oxford) and the Curtiss T. and Mary G.

That messed everything up.\n\nDelano Barr, Shishmaref, Alaska\nIn many ways, climate change isn\u2019t a scientific problem with a scientific solution, it is a cultural problem with a human solution. Our species alone is currently making the planet uninhabitable for ourselves and I firmly believe it will be the ingenuity, determination and resilience of people living today that will save it.\nThe Citi exhibition Arctic: culture and climate brings the experience of climate change to life. It is an exhibition that is rooted in decades of collaborative work between British Museum curators and colleagues, communities and friends throughout the Circumpolar North. It is only through their generosity and sharing of knowledge that this exhibition is made possible.\nThe Citi exhibition Arctic: culture and climate\nListening to the people who are experiencing the first and strongest impacts of global climate change can help us reflect upon our own plans for the future. It is as much about a mental state of being as it is about behaviour and choices. I began getting properly involved in climate change research in the mid 2000s when doing my PhD. I began reading the Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change literature, attending the big international climate change conferences and chatting with the world leading climate specialists during the breaks to find out what they really thought. It is a hard truth to realise that the multiple tipping points in the earth\u2019s planetary systems will soon be reached and irrevocably impact upon the delicately balanced and inter-reliant global society in which we live \u2013 in simple terms the age of humans is in great peril. However, it is always simple conversations with people already living with the impacts of climate change on a daily basis that have provided me with both the sense of urgency and realism that are required to address the challenges involved. Throughout my work since then, I have actively sought to research, understand and communicate the dynamism, complexity and resilience of human societies.\nEight years ago in my interview for my current job at the British Museum I was asked what exhibition I would like to do if I took up my role. Without hesitation, I said that I would like to do a major exhibition on climate change that focused on the lessons we could learn from the history of the human story. I believe the British Museum is an ideal place to base research into the diverse stories of human survival, adaptation, and resilience. These stories from the past and present can help develop an informed and positive mindset for the future. It is the inspirational stories of Arctic Peoples in this exhibition that give me strength and hope for a resilient future.\nIn the Arctic, climate change isn\u2019t a threat in the distant future, it is the experience of daily life right now. This exhibition is a conversation with Arctic Peoples living in their transforming landscapes. Their views give us an opportunity to change the way we look at the problem and consider solutions together.\nDelano Barr, Shishmaref, Alaska reflects upon changing climate.\nThe beautiful objects, images and stories in the exhibition translate abstract scientific facts into human experience. The science tells us that the Arctic summer sea ice will have meaningfully disappeared within a generation, that temperatures are rising faster than anywhere else on the planet. However, it is Arctic Peoples who frame these challenges in their own way as they experience the land melting beneath their feet and coastal villages being swept away. Their perspective and experience, rooted in millennia of cultural knowledge, enable exhibition visitors to see this changing world through a different lens, to reconsider the basis of their relationship with the environment, and reflect on the positive changes that can still be made.\nGraphic showing the changing Arctic summer sea ice extent between 1979 and 2100.\nOften a way of thinking is so ingrained in someone\u2019s understanding of the world it is never questioned. However, objects can reveal the hidden assumptions that people make about the world around them. Some of the most iconic objects in the British Museum are a public statement of dominion by individuals over their landscape \u2013 monuments that materialise a view of the environment as a set of resources just waiting to be used by those with the power, intelligence and technology to exploit them successfully. This view of the world contrasts with how Arctic Peoples have traditionally viewed the planet. For Arctic Peoples, the environment is a living world, an integrated ecosystem in which humans are just one small, and humble element. This means people have to earn the right to take something from the environment, people aren\u2019t entitled to just take what they want.\nArctic Peoples believe that killing an animal isn\u2019t a person\u2019s right, it is something that is earned, and hunting is perceived as the giving and receiving of gifts. This intricately carved arrow straightener carved from walrus ivory embodies, as with many objects in the exhibition, the values of Arctic Peoples. The person who made this believes they had an obligation to use the animal that gave themselves up to the hunter in a respectful way that justifies their death. The beauty and value of what is made with their body is based upon the skill of the craftsperson to make the most of the gift of life they have been given.\nIvory arrow straightener in the form of a caribou with engraved pictographs. Walrus ivory. Before 1949. USA.\nThis is why this arrow straightener takes on a deeper meaning and explains the intricately carved engravings upon it depicting how the body of the caribou (reindeer) hunted with the arrow should be properly treated after death. The caribou fawn shape of the object celebrates the vibrancy of the living world it is part of and communicates to whoever is using the arrow straightener the correct way to respectfully be part of a living world. It is this opportunity for the smallest of objects to change people\u2019s perspectives that makes this Arctic exhibition so powerful.\nPiita Irniq, Inukshuk, 2019.\nOne of my favourite objects in the exhibition is the enigmatic Inukshuk, built recently by Piita Irniq from Naujaat, Repulse Bay, Canada. We first started talking to Piita in November 2013 with the ambition to create a material connection between the changing landscapes of the Arctic and London.\nPiita Irniq from Naujaat, Repulse Bay, Canada talks about the making of the Inukshuk for the exhibition.\nAn Inukshuk is a stone marker that identifies an important cultural place in the landscape, a seasonal hunting or fishing area. They stand resolute and timeless in the landscape, holding fast whilst the world around them changes. They are a symbol of Inuit resilience that stands in the exhibition to encapsulate the importance of this cultural knowledge passed down through time. Piita came over to London and went down to the Gallagher quarry in Maidstone to pick out the pieces of Kentish ragstone himself, bring them back to the Museum and build this Inukshuk for the exhibition in the conservation studios located just 50 metres from where it now stands. This Inukshuk will be an eternal memory of Piita\u2019s contribution, allowing his ideas and views to live on long after the exhibition doors have closed.\nThe next generation of children in the Arctic will be dealing with the challenges of a world transformed by climate change. Child\u2019s all-in-one suit made of caribou hide. Igloolik, Nanavut, northern Canada, 1986.\nIt is this sense of time passing and a world rapidly changing that is often most daunting when thinking about the future. All generations in the Arctic are united by the climate challenges that face them and there is a great focus of attention on preparing the next generation for the transformed world they are inheriting.\nYoung people who created the Atigiit, Silapaat collaborative artwork as part of the Embassy of Imagination arts initiative.\nDuring the development of this exhibition, the Embassy of Imagination arts initiative in Cape Dorset, Nunavut, were asked to help reflect upon how children in the Arctic face this inherited future.

This will be the most extensive archaeological excavation ever undertaken in Benin City, Nigeria. The project is developed with the approval of the Benin Royal Court, the Edo State Government and the Nigerian National Commission for Museums and Monuments. The Legacy Restoration Trust in partnership with the British Museum has secured the equivalent of \u00a33 million of funding to enable this archaeological project.\nThe new Edo Museum of West African Art initiative \u2013 led by the Legacy Restoration Trust, and being designed by the commissioned architects Adjaye Associates \u2013 is focused on reuniting Benin art works currently within international collections, as well as investigating and presenting the wider histories that these represent. The EMOWAA Archaeology Project is a fundamental element of the early phase work for the building of the new museum, which will house the most comprehensive display in the world of Benin Bronzes, alongside other collections.\nThe Legacy Restoration Trust is pleased to be part of the first part of the important journey towards establishing the Edo Museum of West African Art, working in collaboration with Adjaye Associates and the British Museum.\n\nPhilip Ihenacho, Director of Legacy Restoration Trust\nThe Kingdom of Benin: the pre-colonial state and 1897\nThe Kingdom of Benin was one of the most important and powerful pre-colonial states of West Africa. Today Benin is known for its artworks, including castings in brass and bronze, known as the \u2018Benin Bronzes\u2019, as well as objects in other materials, including ivory, coral and wood. The \u2018Benin Bronzes\u2019 include hundreds of plaques which display narratives from the early life of the kingdom. These plaques once decorated the pillars of buildings in the Benin Royal Palace and provide an important historical record of the Kingdom of Benin.\nMap showing the location of Benin City.\nThe kingdom became a major trading partner with Europeans following the arrival of Portuguese explorers on the West African coast in the 15th century. At this time, Benin was already an important political formation and major trading state. It was situated within wider West African regional networks which included trade routes across the Sahara supplying gold, ivory and other products to the North African Islamic world and beyond.\nView of the Benin City Palace and beyond to the wider city, depicted in the 17th-century publication by the Dutch writer Olfert Dapper.\nBenin\u2019s place within history is equally known for its sudden and brutal conquest by British forces in the late 19th century. The invasion of Benin City in 1897 brought widespread destruction and pillage. British forces ransacked the city\u2019s shrines and palaces, and along with other monuments the Royal Palace was burned and destroyed, with thousands of objects of ceremonial and ritual value looted from royal chambers and storerooms. Many of these objects are now in the collections of museums across the UK, Europe and the USA.\nBrass plaque showing Benin court officials flanking a palace entrance or altar. Benin. 16\u201317th century.\nThe British Museum currently cares for more than 900 objects from Benin, a significant proportion of which came to the Museum immediately after the conquest of Benin City in 1897. More than 100 of these objects feature within a changing gallery display at the Museum and the entire collection is accessible via the Museum\u2019s Collection online. You can read more about the Benin collections at the British Museum and how they came to the Museum here.\nDebate and dialogues around Benin cultural heritage\nToday, Benin and its bronzes are the focus of international debates regarding cultural property and restitution. It is against this background that the Benin Dialogue Group developed.\nPhotograph showing British soldiers with objects looted from the royal palace during the military expedition to Benin City in 1897.\nThis group is a consortium of European, UK and Nigerian museums, members of the Benin Royal Court, and representatives of Edo State government. The group, which includes the British Museum, is working together to facilitate the construction of the new museum in Benin City to enable a permanent display of Benin works of art, including significant collections of works currently in UK and European museums, as well as objects in Nigeria.\nIn addition to directly supporting the building of a new museum framed against current debates concerning Benin cultural property and the representation of Benin\u2019s history, it is intended that this Nigerian-British collaborative archaeological project can provide new opportunities to address the painful history of 1897, both through public engagement and critical debate.\nA new museum in Benin City\nDesign proposal for the new Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA) in Benin City \u2013 the construction site of the museum will be a major focus of excavations undertaken by the EMOWAA Archaeology Project.

EMOWAA is focused on reuniting Benin artworks currently within international collections, as well as investigating and presenting the wider histories that these represent. The museum will house a permanent display of Benin works of art, including significant collections of works currently in UK and European museums, as well as objects in Nigeria.\nRendering of proposed reconstructed Royal Spire Pavilion. Image \u00a9 Adjaye Associates.\nThe architectural vision, led by David Adjaye and Adjaye Associates architects and a team of Nigerian professionals, is to use archaeology as a means of connecting the new museum into the surrounding landscape. The designs will revitalise and incorporate the surviving remains of the walls, moats and gates of the historic city, seen throughout the city today, including through a pedestrianising scheme and linear park that allows visitors to experience the history of the ancient city. The museum project also recognises the huge importance of the archaeological remains still preserved below the ground.\nI am humbled and deeply inspired to design the new EMOWAA, a project that will establish a new museum paradigm for Africa\u2026 Decoupling from the Western museum model, the EMOWAA will perform as a re-teaching tool \u2013 a place for recalling lost collective memories of the past to instill an understanding of the magnitude and importance of these civilisations and cultures.\n\nDavid Adjaye, Adjaye Associates\nThe design for the Ceramic Gallery. Image \u00a9 Adjaye Associates.\nThe EMOWAA Archaeology Project\nA central focus of the archaeological project will be essential works on the proposed site of the future EMOWAA museum, to preserve and record historical remains buried beneath the ground in advance of construction. The archaeology and historic restoration project will be delivered with the co-operation of local communities and in coordination with the Edo State government and Adjaye Associates, as well as local urban planning firms. The project will be led by a joint Nigerian and British team and will be developed together with a range of Nigerian researchers and academic institutions, the National Commission for Museums and Monuments, as well as other international researchers. It is planned that this project will also provide local employment and training opportunities.\nThis will be the most extensive archaeological excavation ever undertaken in Benin City and will enable a range of new perspectives on the history of the Benin Kingdom.\nPrevious archaeological investigations in Benin City have focused largely on the monumental defensive wall structures which once surrounded the city and are today still partially visible. The limited test excavations, which took place in the centre of Benin City in the 1950s and 60s, however, revealed some very important finds. These included preserved buildings and traces of elaborate pavements made of pottery fragments. Excavated objects included various metalwork items, such as a brass snake\u2019s head and part of a plaque depicting a mudfish, as well as a variety of other objects telling the life of the pre-colonial kingdom, from decorated pottery vessels to traded glass beads. Today, these finds are little-known, and the buildings and pavements lay buried below the modern city.\nIn addition to informing curatorial narratives and future displays, excavated objects will become part of the EMOWAA museum collections and displays, and all objects will remain in Nigeria. The excavation of the site may also reveal evidence of historic buildings which may be retained in their original position to become part of the visitor experience of the new museum.\nNCMM is very excited about this archaeological work in historic Benin, which we hope and believe will lead to a greater understanding of the ancient kingdom of Benin.\n\nProfessor Abba Tijani.

From lockdown DIY projects to spectacular feats of engineering, we are ingenious when it comes to designing and producing objects. We keep making variations on a theme to get the desired effect \u2013 like making adjustments to instruments to get the right sounds, or changes to a recipe to get the taste we\u2019re looking for. And we have even made things that make other things.\nIt is, however, more than just the love of making that keeps us going. We give objects meaning and value and they help us to explore and interact with the world and other people through the possibilities they open.

Many aesthetics, tools and crafts are slowly being abandoned as knowledge is no longer transferred to younger generations. As a result, the diversity of customary skills, knowledge and practices is decreasing \u2013 sometimes disappearing altogether.\nHow can we keep skills and knowledge alive?\nDoga and another elder do a shell money demonstration at the Torba Day festival in Kweremande Village, Motalava Island.

We\u2019re pleased to announce that EMKP has been awarded a generous grant from Arcadia which enables us to extend the project for a further seven years (2021\u20132028).\nEMKP awards grants to projects that aim to document how things are made, their cultural-specific background and knowledge, as well as their traditions and practices. It promotes the use of sustainable digital recording techniques in ethnographic research, and as part of the programme, an online repository has been created where audio and video recordings, photographs, 3D models and other data will be made publicly accessible for people to use and study.\nThe timely and crucial grant we have received from the Endangered Material Knowledge Programme of the British Museum offers us the opportunity to create audio, audiovisual, documentary, and photographic data assets of this disappearing technological tradition to preserve the heritage resource for generations to come.\nBula Wayessa, Assistant Professor at the University of Minnesota \u2013 2020 grantee\nHere is a run-through of six current EMKP projects that showcase the traditional crafts and knowledge that are now being preserved for the future \u2013 ranging from elaborate Ghanaian gold to Japanese clothing made from paper.\nIndigenous gold forging in Ghana\nTop: Taking the mould out from the furnace.

Photo: Kodzo Gavua\nIn Ghana, power and status have been expressed through gold and gold ornamentation for centuries, and this practice has been a central element of Akan chiefdoms and kingdoms. Royalty commissioned goldsmiths to improve forging technology to create evermore elaborate ornamentation. Goldsmiths also produced jewellery for both elites and ordinary citizens to mark different life stages and milestones, creating an environment where artisans could thrive and imbue their gold objects with layers of symbolic meaning. You can see examples of the skills and creativity of the smiths in the Museum\u2019s collections of gold weights.\nA golden ornament depicting conjoined crocodiles sharing one stomach. It is an Adinkra symbol that is known in Twi as Funtunfunefu-Denkyenfu, a symbol of democracy and unity. Photo: Kodzo Gavua\nBut as locally produced jewellery has become uncompetitive in the market, and as people shy away from traditional culture due to cheaper gilded alternatives and global cross-cultural interaction, the attitude towards local gold forging has changed \u2013 fewer people are interested in acquiring these skills and pursuing metalworking as a career. Working together with Agya Kwabena Tawiah, the goldsmith to the Asante royal court, Professor Kodzo Gavua and colleagues will document the remaining goldsmithing industry and the forging process. Their extensive archive will preserve the knowledge of how gold is transformed into ornaments with symbolic and aesthetic value.\nFollow the full process in the video below.

The millennia-long history of honey production is not only endangered because of the dying-off of bees. Changing ecologies and the (sometimes forced) disconnect between communities and their environments in which beekeeping was sustainably practiced are contributing factors.\nSengwer beekeepers are erecting a beehive made from a hollowed log. Photo: Sam Lunn-Rockliffe\nIn the Cherangani Hills in the west of Kenya, the Sengwer community\u2019s beekeeping practices were closely connected to the ecology of the Embobut forest and the steep slopes of the surrounding mountains, which have changed markedly over the last few decades due to an increase in agriculture. Kenyan and British researchers Sam Lunn-Rockliffe, Timothy Kipkeu Kiprutto and Joseph Kimutai will record local forms of ecological knowledge, focusing on the history of beekeeping, how it helped biodiversity and provided a sense of custodianship, as well as contributing to the diversity and knowledge of apiculture (beekeeping).\nWatch how beekeepers char a beehive in the video below.

Photo: Sarah Doyle\nThe small coral atoll of Rowa in Vanuatu in the South Pacific was once the mint for shell money, or som, a currency that was used in a complex exchange system across northern Vanuatu. People would sail for hundreds of miles to exchange pigs, yams and other valuables for shell money. Som would then continue its journey between islands and it was used as part of ceremonies and to build relationships between communities and individuals.\nMy mother used to produce shell money. The stones they used are still here. We used the shell money to buy food and to pay the bride price. I paid my wife\u2019s bride price with shell money.

However, ni-Vanuatu community leaders have recently come across a small number of elders in the Banks Islands in the north of Vanuatu who continue to make them. This unique opportunity is a chance for a team of ni-Vanuatu and Australian researchers Thomas Dick, Sarah Doyle, Sandy Sur and Dely Roy Nalo to finally study the production and use of som, and understand the complexity of an exchange system that shaped travel and production for centuries.\nRead more about this project here.\nGlass bead making at Ile-Ife in Nigeria\nBabatunde Babalola, the Olokun and other priest, and local community members after conducting ceremonies.

This marked the start of my scientific research into these iconic objects. Since then, an international collaboration was established at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, Ancient Panel Painting; Examination, Analysis and Research (APPEAR), to expand our understanding of mummy portrait technology and materials. The British Museum has played an important part in the APPEAR project from the outset, with 35 partner institutions collaborating from around the world.\nLime wood portrait of a young man, with a gilded stucco frame. Roman period Egypt, AD 150\u2013170.\nBut what are mummy portraits and why are they important? After the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, Egypt became part of the Roman Empire and realistic paintings of people\u2019s faces on wooden panels \u2013 \u2018mummy portraits\u2019 \u2013 became the new trend for burials. These are very different from the stylised faces on decorated wooden coffins that had long been traditional in Egypt. It\u2019s fascinating that, although these mummy portraits became very popular in the first to third centuries AD in Egypt, people there still mummified human bodies as they had always done, burying them in sealed tombs. Two traditions were fused: the old and the new. The mummy portrait was secured in linen wrappings or in a cartonnage (layers of linen mixed with plaster) and placed over the face of the underlying mummy.\nMummy of a Greek youth called Artemidorus in a cartonnage body-case with a lime wood portrait panel covering his face. Roman Period Egypt, early 2nd century AD.\nWhat\u2019s really amazing about the mummy portraits is that they are so life-like. I vividly remember one occasion at the British Museum when I was about to start a lunchtime gallery talk on mummy portraits. A girl about five years old ran towards me, pointing at the portraits, excitedly calling to her mother: \u201cmummy \u2013 look \u2013 real people\u201d. I couldn\u2019t have planned a sweeter gallery talk introduction!\nLime wood portrait of a young man with curly hair.

The women, particularly, are shown with hairstyles, clothes and jewellery reflecting Roman and Greek fashions typical of the time. Many of the people shown in the mummy portraits have been painted in a similar way to those seen on wall-paintings in Italy, for example in Pompeii.\nLime wood mummy portrait of a woman. Roman Period Egypt, AD 160\u2013170.\nLike my colleagues, I wanted to know how, where and why these portraits were created, and what kinds of materials were used to make them. Through scientific research, some of these questions have been answered, but as science is always developing new methods for analysis, it is intriguing to know there are more answers to find. Some years ago British Museum colleagues carried out CT scan of certain mummies with associated mummy portraits partly to see whether the mummified body could be linked to the person in the portrait. You can see their results on Collection online \u2013 but that would be blog in its own right!\nScanning electron microscope image of a radial longitudinal section of fig wood. Scale bar in microns. Image courtesy of C.R. Cartwright.\nI am a wood scientist in the Department of Scientific Research at the British Museum. An important part of my job is to identify the different types of wood that people have chosen for objects, including mummy portraits. I do this by examining and imaging microscopic features in wood structure (such as those shown above), using scanning electron microscopes and comparing them with reference sections of known woods (shown below) using a biological optical microscope. I was surprised by the results of 180 wood identifications I have done so far on mummy portraits in Museum and gallery collections around the world \u2013 70 percent used imported lime tree wood. This has been a major breakthrough in mummy portrait research.\nImage of a transverse thin section of lime reference specimen wood seen in transmitted light in the optical microscope.

Lime trees are not native to Egypt, and lime tree wood was not imported into Egypt for use before the fashion for mummy portraits.\nPhotograph of a Tilia lime tree in the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. Image: \u00a9 C.R. Cartwright 2012\nSo why was lime wood so popular for mummy portraits? It is a quality wood, excellent for carving. Carpenters could cut thin planks, which might be steam-bent to a slight curve so that the painted portrait could be placed snugly over the face of the mummy. It may be that Greek and Roman carpenters, knowing about the great properties of lime wood, first produced portrait panels for use in Europe. We just don\u2019t know, because the preservation of ancient wood in Europe generally is very rare; nowhere near as good as wood from the sealed Egyptian tombs.\nThe lime wood mummy portrait covering the face of Artemidorus, set into a cartonnage body-case. Roman Period Egypt, early 2nd century AD.\nIn addition to 70 percent of mummy portraits being lime wood, I found 10 percent used other woods not from Egypt \u2013 oak, fir and yew from Europe, and cedar from Lebanon. In total, that\u2019s 80 percent of mummy portraits made on non-Egyptian woods. I wonder whether this means that most panels were actually crafted in Europe and brought to Egypt to paint the person shown.\nImage of a transverse thin section of fig wood, seen in transmitted light in the optical microscope. Scale bar in microns. Image courtesy of C.R. Cartwright.\nBefore the Roman period, cedar wood from Lebanon was imported into Egypt for high-status coffins, but in these earlier periods most coffins used local Egyptian woods such as fig (shown above), tamarisk, acacia and sidr (Christ\u2019s thorn). Only 20 percent of Roman period mummy portraits were made on native Egyptian woods. Was there a cost issue for this minority? Perhaps some people could not afford imported lime wood?\nActually it was probably something more complex. It is possible that some portraits were intended to be displayed in houses before being used for burial. If that is true, not all portraits needed to be on thin lime wood panels. Mummy portrait panels that were made using imported oak, fir and yew wood, as well as those using local Egyptian woods, are much thicker and flatter than those on lime wood. Could these have been on domestic display first? There is a curious example in the British Museum \u2013 a small framed portrait made of local fig wood with attached fibre cords. This one, however, may only have been for a wall display. It is difficult to imagine how it could have been placed in cartonnage over a mummy.\nFramed portrait of a woman on fig wood panel, with cord for suspension. Roman Period Egypt, AD 50\u201370.\nI would like to mention scientist Joanne Dyer and conservator Nicola Newman who have made an important contribution to mummy portrait research through the use of multispectral imaging (MSI) techniques. Under different wavelengths of illumination MSI can be used to visualise the materials used in painting the portraits, including Egyptian blue, madder, organic binders and coatings. Sets of multispectral images often act as \u2018maps\u2019 that highlight particular properties, allowing the mummy portraits to be viewed in a new way and to be compared with one another. I hope they will write a future blog on MSI applied to mummy portrait research, as it is a fascinating and highly visual topic.\nFind out more about the inspirational work of our Scientific Research and Collection Care departments on our website.\nExplore rooms 62 and 63 (The Roxie Walker Galleries), where these fascinating objects are on display, virtually here.\nYou can see more about our research in the Getty Publications APPEAR volume online here."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/how-to-conserve-a-fish-skin-bag/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "How to conserve a fish skin bag", "author": "Sophie Louise Rowe, Organics Conservator", "timestamp": "2020-10-20 00:00:00", "text": "In preparation for the upcoming Citi exhibition Arctic: culture and climate, conservators in the Organics conservation lab have come across an array of unexpected and incredible materials used by Arctic Peoples to make everyday objects. Wind- and waterproof translucent parkas made from the intestines of bearded seals, tiny bags intricately sewn from the feet of ducks and harpoon floats used in hunting, made from the bladders of walruses and stomachs of seals, all feature in the new exhibition.\nLeft: a waterpoorf parka made of seal gut; right a bag made from duck feet.\nThe objects \u2013 and the materials used to make them \u2013 are testimony to the amazing ingenuity of the communities in the circumpolar regions. The people who live in these harsh environments have a respectful relationship with the resources and animals around them. The drive to ensure no part of a slaughtered animal is wasted means that parts of animals that we would usually discard have been beautifully and expertly crafted into the most wonderful materials and objects.\nA harpoon with a float made of animal bladder.\nTwo objects in particular have piqued the interest of conservators and visitors to the lab alike \u2013 two bags made, in the most part, from fish skin, or iqertiit in the Yup\u2019ik language. Yup\u2019ik is the name of the cultural group who produced the bags \u2013 they live in the western and southwestern regions of Alaska. The bags themselves, which are known as kellarvik or qemaggvik, meaning storage bag or container, were collected in 1890 (so are likely to have been made before then) and come from southwestern Alaska.\nFish skin bags or kellarvik.\nAlthough perhaps surprising, fish skin is something that was, and still is, quite commonly used in communities across the Circumpolar North. A flexible and waterproof material, it can be used for a variety of different purposes. Aside from bags, the British Museum collection contains examples of shoes, mittens and sewing kits all made from fish skin!\nA pair of mittens made from fish skin.\nThe process of skin preparation can vary from maker to maker but the general principle is that after the meat of the fish (most often king or silver salmon) is removed for eating, the skin is scraped to remove excess flesh and fat. The skins are then soaked in a vat of urine. The ammonia in urine is good at removing fats and oils and preventing decay. Skins would then be rinsed and could be rubbed with fats and/or oils such as fish oil or animal brains, both to soften and to tan the skins. After drying, the skins have to be physically manipulated to make them softer and more flexible. The more the skins are worked, the softer they become. Sometimes the skins are also smoked or dried outside in winter, which freeze-dries them, making the skin paler.\nA woman\u2019s bag made from fish skin.\nI was so interested in fish skin material and how it is made, that last May I travelled to Sweden to learn how to make fish leather with expert tanner Lotta Rahme. Although the process itself can be a little smelly at times, the resulting skins do not smell at all, and can be beautifully soft and strong.\nConservator Sophie Louise Rowe softening oil-tanned fish skin in Sweden by rubbing and manipulating the skin over a blunt metal tool.\nThe bags themselves would have been used for different things. The larger (really quite huge!) bag would have been ideal for storing things such as clothes, furs and skins inside the home. The skin of this bag is very soft and supple, almost floppy, and very thin, similar in thickness to linen cloth. In contrast, the smaller bag is likely to have been used outside to pick berries or carry water or food. In comparison to the large bag, the smaller is very rigid, as if it has got wet during use outside. It is also a bit sticky which hints at the fact that oils have soaked into the surface, either to make the bag more waterproof, or as a result of something oily stored in it. It\u2019s wonderful when you can see and feel the history and use of the objects in front of you.\nOn both bags, the scaly sides of the skins are mostly facing outwards. However, where there are bleached (white) or dyed skins (red), the skins are turned inwards so that the scales are on the inside of the bag and the softer smoother skin underneath is exposed. What is great is that it is still possible to see the form of the fish, as there are areas where the fin has been removed and the resulting small hole delicately stitched closed. Most of the seam stitching on the bags is done with sinew \u2013 a strong fibre made from tendons or ligaments, possibly of beluga whale or caribou (reindeer) \u2013 but you can also see white decorative stitching on both bags, which is believed to be caribou throat hair.\nDetail of one of the bags where the fin of the fish has been removed and the hole carefully stitched closed.\nOn the smaller bag, there are also small strips of white decoration. This is likely to be bleached seal throat, or oesophagus, often used to decorate objects. In wintertime, the oesophagi of seals would be cut from the stomach, inflated and left to freeze-dry outside in the cold, which would turn them very white. These freeze-dried oesophagi are called nerutet in Yup\u2019ik.\nThe fine white decorative stitching on the smaller kellarvik, or storage bag, which is likely to be caribou throat hair. The reddish-brown material is fish skin turned inwards so the scales are facing inside the bag. It has been coloured either by rubbing a pigment like ochre, or by dyeing using something like Alder bark. The strip of cream material is likely to be freeze-dried oesophagus (nerutet).\nFor the conservation treatment, it was important to figure out what was needed to ensure the safe display and handling of the bags. Overall, the larger bag was in worse condition and because the bag itself is quite large, it was sagging under its own weight, causing it to become misshapen and creased. Creasing is a problem with materials like leather, as it causes the fibres to become damaged, creating an area of weakness that is likely to tear. A number of tears were already spotted on the bag, which were causing it to become even more misshapen and likely to get bigger if not addressed.\nThe larger bag, or kellarvik, before treatment.\nClose-up of a large tear in the bigger bag.\nIn order to repair these tears, and to re-shape and remove creasing from the bag, it needed to be placed in a higher humidity environment. Increasing the humidity around an object allows us to gently and carefully relax the leather and make it temporarily more flexible. In order to do this, a large sealed chamber was created and moisture was introduced to slowly raise the ambient humidity. After a day relaxing in the chamber, the bag was much more flexible and it could be gently re-shaped.\nThe sealed environment used to raise the humidity around the large bag.\nRepairs at an early stage. Small tabs of Japanese tissue are used to bring edges temporarily into alignment. Small round magnets also help to hold everything in place.\nAt this point the edges of the tears could begin to be brought back together. This started by using little temporary sticky tabs, made of Japanese tissue. These function almost like sutures or stitches, to bring the broken skin back together from the front, checking that everything was in good alignment. The bag was then supported on its side which allowed access to the inside to carry out a supportive repair.\nThe bag turned on its side and conservator Sophie working inside to repair tears.\nIt is sometimes quite surreal when you find your day at work involves spending hours with your head in the depths of a giant fish-skin bag! But being able to work on the inside of the bag meant that supportive patches of Japanese tissue could be introduced as a backing along the tears. Japanese tissue is commonly used to repair tears in the conservation lab \u2013 its long fibres mean that it is actually quite strong for a material that appears so thin, but it is also flexible and sympathetic to materials such as leather. The way in which the backing was applied makes it easily reversible if it ever needs to be removed in the future.\nJapanese tissue backing. The tissue can be coloured with paints to a sympathetic colour so that it is not visible. This is then adhered to the inside of the back using a thin film of heat-activated adhesive and very delicate and precise heated spatula.\nJapanese tissue backing in place inside the bag which can only be seen faintly.\nOnce the backing was in place, the temporary tabs on the front of the bag could be carefully removed so that the repair was not visible. A number or repairs were carried out in this way, and each was carefully documented so that future staff are aware of the more modern intervention on the bag. Once all tears were stabilised, the large bag was gently re-shaped and filled with custom-made pads and foam supports. These allow the bag to be fully supported during display, as well as in long-term storage.\nThe tear before and after treatment.\nThe large bag after treatment.\nThe smaller bag was in better condition, but needed a few creases to be removed, and it had some tears which needed support. Initially, we used Japanese tissue to support the tears in the same manner as the larger bag. However, curators and exhibition designers wanted to illuminate the smaller bag in way that showed off the amazing translucent qualities of the fish skin. But passing light through the bag highlighted the opaque tissue repairs! Something more transparent as a backing material was required\u2026\nThe first Japanese tissue repairs on the top rim of the bag.\nThe first repairs are visible as shadows at the top of the bag when light was shone though the bag.\nIn the end, a repair was carried out using a material called \u2019Goldbeaters skin\u2019, which is actually processed intestine, traditionally from an Ox. This might sound like an odd choice, but Goldbeaters skin is often used to repair parchment, so is a tried and tested method. The real benefit is that the material is transparent and very thin, so light passes through it well and repairs appear almost invisible.\nGoldbeaters skin being used to repair the smaller fish skin bag. You can see how transparent it is.\nGoldbeaters Skin repair adhered in place on the reverse of a tear.\nAlthough not as strong as Japanese tissue, which is made of cellulose fibres, Goldbeaters skin was good for the minor repairs required on the smaller bag and, once in place, you couldn\u2019t notice the repair at all.\nThe bag, illuminated from within, with repairs now invisible.\nBoth bags are now looking much happier and are ready for display in the exhibition.\nOne of the bags on display in the Citi exhibition Arctic: culture and climate.\nIt was real joy and a privilege to work with these objects \u2013 and to learn so much about the people who made them. Much of the information in this blog on materials, processing, and use of objects has come from videos shared on the Smithsonian Arctic Studies Center\u2019s YouTube Channel where detailed explanations and demos from Alaskan fish skin makers and artists Audrey Armstrong, Coral Chernoff and Marlene Nielsen were invaluable. Discussions with Alaska Native community members and artists recorded on the Smithsonian Native Collections \u201cSharing Knowledge\u201d website and from the book Yuungnaqpiallerput: The Way We Genuinely Live, Masters of Yup\u2019ik Survival and Science by Ann Fienup-Riordan were also vital resources.

It is rooted in sacred instructional texts, composed from around the sixth century onwards, called the Tantras. Many describe rituals that transgress social and religious conventions within mainstream Hinduism and Buddhism.\nSome Tantras describe sexual rites for achieving enlightenment. These can be understood both literally and symbolically.\u00a0 If taken literally, a couple assumes the role of deities in sexual union, the woman often being the focus of worship. When interpreted symbolically, a practitioner visualises this union within their own body, the deities symbolising qualities such as wisdom and compassion. The Tantra pictured here, composed in ancient Sanskrit, recommends the union of the \u2018thunderbolt\u2019 and \u2018lotus\u2019, which can be understood as the phallus and vulva.\nFolio from the Vajramrita Tantra (Nectar of the Thunderbolt Tantra). Palm leaf, Nepal, 1162. \u00a9 Cambridge University Library.\nThe Tantras were first translated into English in the 19th century, when India was under British rule, and were reductively misinterpreted by many Christian missionaries, Orientalist scholars and colonial officials. Such distortions went on to inform current misunderstandings of Tantra in the West as an orgiastic \u2018cult of ecstasy\u2019.\nThe role of sex\nErotic imagery not only plays an important role in Tantra, but also in mainstream Hinduism. According to Hindu belief, the creation of the universe is believed to be a product of divine sexual union, and the goals of a fulfilling and righteous life are not only duty (dharma), prosperity (artha) and liberation (moksha), but also desire (kama).\nDuring the medieval period in India, erotic carvings of couples (mithuna) were considered to bring good fortune and protection. The sculpture below would have once been positioned on the wall of a Hindu temple. Two lovers caress each other, their lips about to touch. There is nothing particularly Tantric about this sculpture. An architectural manual written in about AD 900 includes the following instruction: \u2018kama is the root of the universe \u2026 erotic sculpture panels should be mounted [in temples] in order to delight the general public.\u2019\nErotic mithuna (\u2018couple\u2019) sculpture. Red sandstone, India, late 10th century. Funded by the Brooke Sewell Permanent Fund.\nAn image of a courtly looking couple painted in the 17th century is one of a series illustrating sexual positions. Such images were influenced by ancient texts dedicated to kama, such as the Kama Sutra, written by Vatsyayana around the AD 200s. According to this text, sexual pleasure for those living at court should be a cultivated \u2018art\u2019. Contrary to Western misperceptions, Tantra had little to do with the science of pleasure outlined in the Kama Sutra, which was composed before the rise of Tantra and was guided by Hindu beliefs.\nPainting of a couple having sex. Possibly Bikaner, Rajasthan, India. Gouache on paper, about 1690.\nTantra introduced a different idea. Rather than seeking pleasure as an end in itself, Tantra taught practitioners to harness the body and sensuality in order to unite with divinity and attain transformational power. Tantric sexual rites were also distinguished by their transgressive nature, engaging with the taboo rather than repressing it.\nOn the left of the temple frieze sculpture below a man engages in oral sex with a woman. It probably represents the Tantric ritual of yoni puja (veneration of the vulva). According to orthodox Hindu codes of conduct, this was transgressive because it threatened reproductive sex and social stability. While female sexual fluids were also traditionally regarded as polluting, Tantric practitioners aimed to access the repressed power of the forbidden, transforming it into divine matter.\nIn Tantric texts, women are described as embodiments of Shakti (divine feminine power), and this power could be ritually accessed through their sexual fluids. To venerate the yoni (vulva) was to venerate the source of creation itself. When they engaged in sexual rites, practitioners imagined themselves as divine incarnations of Shakti and the Hindu god Shiva.\nErotic maithuna (\u2018sexual union\u2019) sculpture. Sandstone, Maharashtra, India. 11th century.\nTantric yoga\nWhile Tantric sexual rites could be carried out literally, by a couple assuming the roles of Shiva and Shakti, they could also be imagined as an internal union of deities using visualisation exercises. The goal of Tantric yoga is to awaken an individual\u2019s inner source of Shakti, located at the base of the spine and visualised as the serpent goddess Kundalini. Around her is a network of energy centres (chakras), each of which contains a deity. Through breath control and complex postures, Kundalini rises up the body. In this painting a yogi experiences bliss as Kundalini (represented as a white coil at the base of the spine) prepares to move upwards through the chakras. As she comes into contact with each deity within, she infuses them with power, enabling the yogi to reach higher spiritual planes. At the crown of the head resides Shiva, embodying pure consciousness (represented here by a multi-petalled lotus). They unite, enacting a sexual rite within the yogi\u2019s own body. Their union triggers an awakened, liberated state and is believed to grant access to various powers, from long life to invulnerability.\nYogi with chakras, Rajasthan, northwest India, early 1800s. \u00a9 Wellcome Collection, London.\nDivine union\nThe rise of Tantra led to a new school of Tantric Buddhism known as Vajrayana or the Path of the Thunderbolt, which had spread across Asia by the eighth century, with a particularly strong hold in Tibet. According to Vajrayana teachings, the qualities of wisdom (prajna) and compassion (karuna) must be cultivated on the path to enlightenment. Tantric texts and images represent these qualities as a goddess (wisdom) and a god (compassion) in sexual union.\nIn Tibet this is known as yab-yum, meaning \u2018father-mother\u2019. Devata (Deity) yoga is a Vajrayana practice that involves visualising and fully internalising these deities in union within the body, with the aim of embodying their supreme qualities. This practice inspired the creation of yab-yum images, which are used to support meditation.\nThe Tibetan thangka below shows two deities embracing, Chakrasamvara and Vajrayogini. Their red-rimmed, wild eyes and laughing, fanged mouths suggest their immense power. The role of such wrathful imagery highlights the Tantric belief that only the most ferocious deities can abolish the obstacles to enlightenment. They are deities to be adored as well as emulated.\nThe image evokes the interplay of feminine (wisdom) and masculine (compassion) principles that must be internalised. Both deities hold up weapons with which they destroy misplaced pride, attachment, anger, ignorance and worldly desire. Yab-yum images such as this were commissioned to aid visualisations during Devata yoga. The practitioner internalises the deities and recognises in themselves both the female and male principles, merging the two within their own body. Emptied of ego, the practitioner achieves self-deification.\nThangka (painting on silk) depicting Chakrasamvara in union with Vajrayogini. Tibet, 18th century.\nThe Hevajra Tantra dates to the late AD 800s and describes the benefits of engaging in sexual rites in order to elevate and transcend desire itself. On the folio below are the words: \u2018by passion the world is bound; by passion too it is released.\u2019 Sexual rites should not be \u2018taught for the sake of enjoyment, but for the examination of one\u2019s own thought, whether the mind is steady or wavering.\u2019 Even celibate monks and nuns could engage with this method by internalising deities in union through visualisation.\nHevajra Tantra. Palm leaf, Bengal, India, 15/16th century. \u00a9 Cambridge University Library.\nSex and death\nDuring the 19th century, Bengal in eastern India was an early Tantric centre as well as the nucleus of British rule. Tantra informed the way many Christian missionaries and colonial officials imagined India, as a subcontinent apparently corrupted by sexual depravity. Their misconceptions were embodied by seemingly demonic Tantric goddesses such as Chinnamasta, pictured in the print below. Here she clutches her own severed head, which drinks one of the three streams of blood spurting from her neck. The other two streams nourish her attendants. A revolutionary Bengali text described Chinnamasta\u2019s radical potential as a symbol of the Motherland, decapitated by the British but preserving her vitality by drinking her own blood, representing an ideal of heroic fearlessness and self-sacrifice.\nThe image communicates the inseparability and interdependence of sex, life and death at the heart of human experience. She stands upon the copulating deities of love and desire (the god Kama and goddess Rati), as if to suggest that she transcends desire while also being fundamentally supported by it. Rati is shown on top of Kama, signalling the superiority of the female principle within Tantra.\nChinnamasta (\u2018She Whose Head is Severed\u2019), Lalashiu Gobin Lal. Hand-coloured woodblock, Kolkata, India, late 19th century.\nBeyond sex\nOnce attacked by colonial officials as perverse, since the 1960s Tantra as a tradition has been celebrated as the \u2018art of sexual ecstasy\u2019 in the West. Although Tantric visual culture features a proliferation of erotic images and many Tantric texts include descriptions of sexual rites, these make up only a small proportion of the content. While kama (\u2018desire\u2019) was a principal goal of life according to mainstream Hinduism, one of the central aims of Tantric sex was to unite with divinity, rather than to seek pleasure for its own sake. Tantra validates the body and the sensual as a means of achieving liberation and generating power.\nSexual rites could be imagined as an internal union of deities, or carried out literally by a couple assuming the roles of deities. This exhibition seeks to provide the interpretive tools for understanding how these tensions between literal and symbolic registers co-exist and are part of what make Tantra unique.\nFind\u00a0out\u00a0more\u00a0about Tantra:\u00a0enlightenment\u00a0to\u00a0revolution by checking out Imma\u2019s blog \u2018What is Tantra?\u2019\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\nSupported by the Bagri Foundation\nBuy the beautifully illustrated book accompanying the exhibition.

At the exhibition\u2019s heart was an extraordinary new work, which the exhibition was named after. The work \u2013 the eponymous Tomb \u2013 was an elaborate, richly decorated cast-iron coffin-ship. It was a memorial to forgotten artists who, through the ages, had made many of the objects found in the British Museum.\nThe Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman at the centre of Grayson Perry\u2019s 2011 British Museum exhibition of the same name.\nThe work takes the form of an iron ship sailing into the afterlife. The ship is also a pun, a craft for the craftsman, an ark carrying things that have survived into the future. It is hung with casts of the fruits of their labours, mostly replicas of objects from the collection at the Museum, and carries a cargo of blood, sweat and tears. Now, nine years later and as we reopen after an unprecedented five-month closure, the Tomb is back.\nGrayson Perry in a publicity shot for The Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman exhibition, 2011.\nYou can see the work on the new one-way route around the galleries \u2013 although the version going on display this time is a never before-seen sister piece to the one in the 2011 exhibition, completed very recently. Perry made four versions of the Tomb (three editions plus an artist\u2019s proof) in 2011 \u2013 one was the centrepiece of the exhibition, but the one now going on display remained unfinished for many years.

The Nereid Monument is also a tomb \u2013 but was built in around 380 BC for Erbinna, a ruler of Lycia (now southwestern Turkey). It was built to celebrate his life and to create a monument for the afterlife. Stylistic details of the Nereid Monument reveal that the sculptures were carved by different artists, but their names are now lost to history. The Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman sits in dialogue with the Nereid Monument, as a contemporary memorial to all those unnamed skilled individuals \u2013 men and women \u2013 who made some of the wonders of history.\nThe Nereid Monument.

The vessel takes its name from the artist who made it \u2013 it is inscribed with the words \u2018Sophilos made me\u2019.\nThe vase is decorated with scenes from Greek myth including the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, parents of the hero Achilles. The mythical hero was one of the greatest warriors of the Trojan War, the story of which is told by Homer in the Iliad.\nFind out more about Achilles and his famous heel in our blog.\n3. The Parthenon Sculptures\nSculptures from the Parthenon\u2019s East pediment on display in Room 18.\nMarble sculpture. Athens, 438\u2013432 BC.\nCarved about 2,500 years ago, these ancient Greek sculptures adorned the Parthenon, a temple on the Athenian Acropolis (the ancient citadel on a rocky hill in the city). The temple was dedicated to the goddess Athena Parth\u00e9nos, who was the patron deity of Athens. The word parth\u00e9nos means \u2018maiden, girl\u2019 or \u2018virgin, unmarried woman\u2019.\nThe temple was richly decorated with sculptures, designed by the artist Pheidias. The pediments (the triangular structure on the top of the temple) and metopes (carved panels) illustrate episodes from Greek myth, while the frieze represents the people of Athens in a religious procession to celebrate the birthday of the goddess. A colossal image of Athena made of gold and ivory once stood inside the temple \u2013 it is now lost.\nYou can read more about the Parthenon in our Introduction to the Parthenon sculptures blog.

Grayson Perry\u2019s The Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman\nGrayson Perry with his sculpture The Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman in Room 17.\nGrayson Perry (b. 1960), The Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman, 2011. Cast iron, oil paint, glass, rope, wood, flint hand axe. \u00a9 Grayson Perry. Courtesy Victoria Miro.\nThis artwork on temporary display was made by British Museum Trustee and Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry. The piece, an iron ship sailing into the afterlife, is a memorial to all those unnamed skilled individuals \u2013 men and women \u2013 who have made the beautiful objects found in the Museum. The work will be displayed Room 17, next to the Nereid Monument from western Turkey, built in around 390 BC. The Nereid Monument was a tomb for a local ruler, built and carved by artists whose names are now lost.\nFind out more about the display here.\nDisplay supported by Christian and Florence Levett\n5. Crouching Venus\nCrouching Venus on display in Room 23.\nMarble sculpture. Roman, second century AD.\nThis sculpture, from the second century AD, is a Roman version of a much earlier Greek statue of the goddess Aphrodite, or Venus to the Romans. The Greek marble or bronze original, now lost, was perhaps made between 200 and 100 BC. Aphrodite was the Greek goddess of love and is often shown accompanied by Eros, the god of love, or cupids and doves. Here the sculpture makes the viewer a voyeur, surprising the goddess as she bathes.\nThe sculpture is on long-term loan from the Royal Collection. You can explore collections around the country and discover the fascinating connections between them using #CollectionsUnited on social media.\n6. Bust of Ramesses the Great\nBust of Rameses the Great on display in Room 4.\nGranite statue. Egypt, 19th Dynasty (1292\u20131189 BC).\nThis colossal bust is of the Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses II, who reigned from 1279\u20131213 BC. Weighing an incredible 7.5 tonnes, the bust was once part of a larger statue which sat in the Ramesseum, a temple in Thebes (modern Luxor) built by the pharaoh. Its decoration celebrated his military achievements and his close association with the creator god Amun-Ra. The press coverage of the bust\u2019s transportation to the UK is believed to have inspired the poet Shelley\u2019s favourite sonnet, Ozymandias.\nYou can explore what life was like in ancient Thebes in our Historical city travel guide blog.\n7. The Ife Head\nThe Ife Head.\nBrass head. Ife, 14th\u2013early 15th century AD.\nThis naturalistic brass head is probably around 600 years old. It is considered to most likely depict an Ooni, a sacred king of the West African Kingdom of Ife. Ife, today in Nigeria, is regarded as the cultural and spiritual homeland of the Yoruba-speaking peoples and the title of Ooni is still that used today by the traditional ruler of Ife.\nRepresentations of humans in art from Ife, like this one, have a striking, highly naturalistic style. In the past, Western scholars falsely believed that the Ife heads may have been influenced by Classical sculpture, or that they were made by Europeans, reflecting historic negative attitudes towards African art and culture and the perceived superiority of Western art.\nThe Ife Head gives us a perspective on the fascinating history of powerful rulers and kingdoms in medieval West Africa. Mary Beard, who recently became a Trustee of the British Museum, picked this object as one of her top five in the Museum \u2013 read her thoughts about this stunning sculpture here.\n8. Tree of Life\nTree of Life on display in Room 25.\nCrist\u00f3v\u00e3o (Kester) Canhavato, Hilario Nhatugeuja, Adelino Mate and Fiel dos Santos, Tree of Life. Metal sculpture, Mozambique, 2004.\nThis powerful sculpture was made for the British Museum in 2004 by four artists, Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o (Kester) Canhavato, Hilario Nhatugeuja, Adelino Mate and Fiel dos Santos, working with decommissioned weapons in Mozambique.\nIn the aftermath of the armed struggle for independence from Portuguese colonial rule, achieved in 1974, Mozambique entered a period of civil war, from 1977. During this period millions of guns poured into the country. After the war ended in 1992, a scheme called \u2018Transforming Arms into Tools\u2019 was set up by the Mozambican Bishop Dom Dinis Sengulane, encouraging Mozambicans to exchange weapons for other goods. The sculpture, made from weapons collected by the scheme, includes chopped-up AK-47 rifles, pistols and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.\n9. Akan Drum\nThe Akan Drum.\nDrum made of wood with an animal skin head. Made in Ghana, found in Virginia, USA, 18th century.\nThis wooden drum is the earliest African-American object in the British Museum. It was collected in Virginia, then a British colony and now a state within the USA, around 1730. It was once incorrectly thought to be an object produced by Indigenous People of North America, but was in fact made in West Africa more than 300 years ago. It was probably made by a craftsperson of the Akan people in the region of present-day Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, hence it being known as the \u2018Akan Drum\u2019.\nIt is thought that the Akan Drum was taken to Virginia on a slave ship, part of the trans-Atlantic slave trade which transported millions of Africans to America against their will between the 17th and the 19th centuries. Drums were played during these journeys and captives were forced to dance for \u2018exercise\u2019 in order to keep them healthier for plantation labour amid the horrendous conditions. In North America, drums were confiscated and banned as part of the forced suppression of Africans and their culture.\nThe drum is part of our Collecting and empire trail \u2013 find out more about the trail and how this object arrived at the Museum here.\n10. Aztec serpent\nAztec serpent.\nPectoral, in the form of a double-headed serpent. Made of cedro wood and covered with mosaic made of turquoise and shell. Mexico, 1400\u20131521.\nCreated in what is now Mexico in the 15th or 16th century, this extraordinary double-headed serpent sculpture is made of about 2,000 pieces of turquoise over a wooden base. It probably had ritual significance, perhaps being worn or carried during religious ceremonies.\nSnakes were sacred to the Aztecs as they were the symbol of the feathered serpent god, Quetzalcoatl. The Aztec Empire consisted of many subject territories, stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific. Frequently they had to provide gifts as tribute to demonstrate their allegiance to the Aztec emperor. Tributes in the form of turquoise were particularly highly valued.\n11. The Piranesi Vase\nThe Piranasi Vase on display in Room 1.\nMarble crater. Roman, second century AD, restored 18th century.\nThis 2.7-metre tall vase was constructed in the 1700s from a great number of classical fragments and modern additions. It belonged to the Italian engraver, architect and antiquarian Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1729\u20131778), who is best known for his architectural views of ancient and modern Rome, both real and imagined.\nThe vase, along with other pieces, was crafted by Piranasi from ancient fragments reportedly found at the Pantanello, a site on the grounds of the villa of the Roman emperor Hadrian at Tivoli, near Rome. He restored these fragments and incorporated them into highly decorative pastiches.\n12. Edmund de Waal library of exile\nlibrary of exile on display in Room 5.\nEdmund de Waal (b. 1964), library of exile, 2019. Courtesy of the artist and Gagosian.\nCreated as a \u2018space to sit and read and be\u2019, library of exile is an installation by British artist and writer Edmund de Waal, housing more than 2,000 books in translation, written by exiled authors.\nThe porcelain-covered room houses books from Ovid and Dante, to Marina Tsvetaeva and Judith Kerr, forming a record of repression while celebrating the response of the displaced.\nThe British Museum was home to the British Library from 1759 until 1997. The library of exile also speaks to objects in the Museum\u2019s collection from the world\u2019s historic libraries.\nFind out more about the installation here.\nExhibition supported by AKO Foundation\n13. Haida House Pole\nThe 15m Haida House Pole on display in the Great Court.\nTotem pole carved of wood. Kayung, British Columbia, around 1850.\nThis pole was made around 1850 and once stood at the front of a clan house in the village of Kayang, British Columbia, Canada. It features crests \u2013 ancestral beings that mark identity and endow families with rights to stories and property. The House and village of Kayang was deserted due to epidemics introduced by Europeans in the 19th century. Chief of the House sold the pole to a doctor who then sold it to the British Museum.\n14. Hoa Hakananai\u2019a\nHoa Hakananai\u2019a on display in Room 24.\nBasalt statue, Orongo, around 1000\u20131200\u00a0AD.\nThis statue, known as Hoa Hakananai\u2019a, comes from the ceremonial village of Orongo on Rapa Nui (Easter Island). It is one of a number of statues, known as moai, for which the island is famous, which date to around AD 1000\u20131200.\nMost moai were positioned on platforms (known as ahu), which generally faced away from the ocean, so the statues gazed inwards to the land and its people. Across Polynesia, Islanders worshipped ancestors who traced their lineages back to the gods. Moai were raised in honour of important deified ancestors. Today, Moai are described as the aringa ora, the living faces of the ancestors.\nHoa Hakananai\u2019a is carved from hard basalt and on his back are a number of petroglyphs depicting frigate bird heads and human/bird figures, amongst other things. These relate to the island\u2019s \u2018birdman\u2019 ceremonies which were associated with fertility and access to resources.\nWe can\u2019t wait to welcome you back.

Since then, the collection has grown enormously, and now contains around eight million objects.\nObjects have entered the Museum\u2019s collection through many different routes \u2013 some have been acquired directly, for example through excavation or purchase, while others have passed through different owners, sometimes over a long period of time. The Museum continues to actively collect today. In the case of objects acquired in earlier centuries, it\u2019s not always clear exactly how they were collected because the details were not recorded at the time.\nThe Museum is committed to researching the collection to better understand the provenance of objects where our knowledge is incomplete. The British Museum\u2019s history and collection are intimately linked to the history of the British Empire and the era of European colonialism. The wealth generated from the expansion of Britain\u2019s global empire and from its exploitation of resources and people, especially through the transatlantic slave trade, enabled the growth of collections such as those of the British Museum. The Museum is working with others around the world to ensure that the varied, and sometimes complicated and contested, history of collecting is acknowledged and debated.\nAs the Museum reopens, we are encouraging visitors to follow a new Collecting and empire trail to find out more about the complex, varied \u2013 and sometimes controversial \u2013 ways in which objects have become part of the collection. Further objects will be added in the months ahead as other galleries reopen to the public, and as collaborative work on Collecting and empire interventions progresses. The trail will be evaluated to help inform future plans to develop new permanent gallery displays.\nHere are some of the objects that the trail explores.\nLion statues of Amenhotep III\nGranite statue of Amenhotep III as a lion. Upper Nubia (present-day Sudan), 1390\u20131352 BC.\nThese colossal granite lions were donated to the British Museum by Lord Prudhoe, the Duke of Northumberland, in 1835. The statues\u2019 history stretches back several thousand years to when they were commissioned by pharaoh Amenhotep III (about 1390\u20131352 BC) for the Temple of Soleb in Upper Nubia (northern Sudan), then a colony of pharaonic Egypt. Around 1,100 years later, when the powerful and independent kingdom of Kush ruled the area, these already ancient sculptures were shipped 420 km south up the Nile to a royal palace at Jebel Barkal.\nEgyptian rulers tended to think of northern Sudan as an extension of their territory, both in ancient times and during the 19th century. When Lord Prudhoe visited Jebel Barkal in 1829, he and his party were travelling into a Sudan recently conquered by Muhammad Ali, the ruler of Egypt. This ushered in over a century of Egyptian control, and then Anglo-Egyptian rule, with an intervening period of Sudanese rule under the Mahdi (1881\u20131898).\nWhile in Jebel Barkal, Lord Prudhoe arranged the shipment of the lions to England. The British Consul General in Cairo helped secure the necessary firmans (permissions) from the authorities. Lord Prudhoe then donated the lions to the British Museum in 1835.\nLord Prudhoe described Kushite architecture as \u2018a very bad copy of Egyptian, bad in design and worse in execution\u2019. For him, the presence of these Egyptian lions at Jebel Barkal reflected a Kushite desire to emulate Egypt. However, the lions are now seen as examples of Kushite creativity in incorporating aspects of Egyptian pharaonic culture within the context of long established local traditions.\nYou can see the lions in Room 4: Egyptian sculpture.\nThe Nereid Monument\nThe Nereid Monument, Xanthus, Turkey, 390\u2013380 BC.\nIn the early 1840s Charles Fellows, a traveller and antiquary, led two archaeological expeditions to Lycia (on the south western coast of modern-day Turkey). He obtained the permission of the Ottoman Sultanate in Constantinople (Istanbul), to excavate at the ancient city of Xanthos. It was there that Fellows discovered the Nereid Monument, lying in ruins. Once a firman had been secured, Fellows began to excavate and remove the ruined monuments, with funding from the British Museum. The Royal Navy helped move the heavy stone pieces down the River Xanthos to the ship HMS Beacon, and onward to Malta before being shipped to Britain.\nWithin the Turkish Ottoman empire lay many sites with ancient Egyptian, Assyrian, Greek and Roman monuments. During the 19th century, permissions were granted to a number of British, French and German archaeological expeditions to excavate these sites and remove objects and architecture. The first Decree legislating against the export of antiquities from Ottoman territories was issued in 1869. In the same year, the Sultan Abdulaziz ordered the creation of what would become the Istanbul Archaeological Museum.\nOngoing excavations led by Turkish archaeologists are now providing new information on the ancient site of Xanthos, but the exact design of the Nereid Monument, and the positioning of its sculptures, is still debated.\nRead more about the monument here and see it on display in Room 17.\nKwakawak\u2019wakw mask\nWood and leather mask, Canada, c.1910.\nThis mask was created by the Kwakwaka\u2019wakw people of the Pacific Northwest Coast in Canada (First Nation community). It is currently on long-term loan at the Kwakwaka\u2019wakw-run U\u2019mista Cultural Centre in Alert Bay, British Columbia. Representing an ancestral being or Crest, the mask can be opened to reveal a separate figure within.\nIt would have been worn as part of a ceremonial celebration called a potlatch, in which rights and titles are publicly acknowledged. Hosting and participating in potlatches was banned by a Canadian Act of Parliament, the Indian Act, in 1884. In 1921, the Canadian authorities discovered a potlatch hosted by Chief Dan Cranmer on Village Island in British Columbia. They arrested and imprisoned a number of participants, as well as seizing and confiscating masks and regalia, including this one.\nThe Canadian government sold many of these masks to North American museums. This mask was sold in 1938 by what is now known as the National Museum of the American Indian, part of the Smithsonian. Harry Beasley, a British collector and founder of the now-defunct Cranmore Ethnographic Museum acquired the object\u00a0and in 1944, his wife, Irene Beasley, donated it to the British Museum.\nGloria Cranmer Webster \u2013 an anthropologist and daughter of Chief Dan Cranmer \u2013 identified the mask from a 1922 photograph of seized regalia. In 2005, after years of careful discussions, the U\u2019mista Cultural Centre and the British Museum agreed a long-term loan of the mask to Alert Bay.\nThis text was written in consultation with U\u2019mista Cultural Centre, Canada.\nRead more about the mask here.\nAkan Drum\nAkan drum, Ghana, early 18th century.\nThis wooden drum is the earliest African-American object in the British Museum. It was made by Akan people in West Africa over 300 years ago. The first enslaved Africans arrived in North America in 1619 and it is assumed the drum crossed the Atlantic aboard a slave ship, but this is not known for certain. Drums were played during these journeys and captives were forced to dance for exercise in order to keep them healthier \u2013 amid the horrendous conditions \u2013 for labour on slave plantations. In North America, drums were confiscated and banned as part of the forced suppression of Africans and their culture.\nAround 1730, a Reverend Clerk acquired the drum \u2013 it is not recorded how \u2013 in Virginia, then a British colony and now a state within the USA. The drum passed from him to Museum founder Sir Hans Sloane (1660\u20131753) in England where it became part of his collection, incorrectly recorded as a drum made by the Indigenous Peoples of North America. Scientific examination revealed that the main body of the drum is made from a variety of wood found in West Africa (and other parts of Africa) but not North America.\nSloane\u2019s career as a collector began in 1687 when he became physician to the Governor of Jamaica, then a British colony. Sloane worked as a doctor on plantations worked by enslaved people. With assistance from English planters and enslaved people he assembled a collection of around 800 plant specimens, animals, local tools and personal items. On returning from the Caribbean Sloane married an heiress to Jamaican sugar plantations worked by enslaved people, profits from which allowed him to greatly expand his collections.\nIn his will, Sloane bequeathed his entire collection to the public in return for a payment of \u00a320,000 to his heirs. Sloane\u2019s collection, with several additional libraries and collections, became the foundation of the British Museum.\nYou can read more about the life and collection of Hans Sloane here, or by visiting a newly updated display about Sloane\u2019s collecting and his relationship with empire and slavery in Case 14, Room 1, at the British Museum.\nGuests Miranda Lowe and James Delbourgo join Director Hartwig Fischer and curator Sushma Jansari for a special podcast episode focusing on Hans Sloane. They examine the role of slavery and enslaved people in his collecting practices and consider how museums should respond to these histories. Listen here.\nIn another special podcast episode, Hartwig Fischer and Sushma Jansari are joined by guests Olivette Otele and Bonnie Greer to discuss the legacies of slavery, its impact on today\u2019s society, and how museums should respond to these histories both now and in the future. Listen here.\nSoup plate from China\nPorcelain soup plate, China, 1743.\nThis soup plate is from a porcelain dinner service commissioned by Commodore Lord Anson of the British East India Company. Lord Anson led the East India Company on a circumnavigation of the world in 1743 \u2013 it was on a visit to Canton in China during this journey that he commissioned this set of porcelain.\nEuropean and American direct trade with China was dominated by the Honourable East India Company, which held a monopoly from 1672 until 1833. The East India Company traded many commodities including, in the early 19th century, opium that was grown in India and bought for recreational and medicinal use. The refusal of the Company to reduce this trade when challenged by Qing government officials led to the First Opium War (1839\u20131842). The Treaty of Nanjing, which ended the war, forced the Qing emperors to open further \u2018Treaty Ports\u2019 for international trade.\nThe plate was bequeathed to the Museum by Anson\u2019s relative, politician Thomas George Anson, 2nd Earl of Lichfield (1825\u20131892). The rest of the service is in the National Trust property of Shugborough in Staffordshire, Anson\u2019s ancestral home.\nRead more about this object here and see it on display in Room 1.\nBark shield\nBark and wood shield, New South Wales, Australia, late 18th \u2013 early 19th century.\nThis shield, of bark and red mangrove wood, is from New South Wales, Australia, and dates to the late 18th or early 19th century. The size and shape of the hole near the centre suggest it was pierced by a spear. Broad shields such as this were used as defensive weapons against spears. There is no specific record of how this object came to the Museum. Although once thought to have been collected in 1770 by James Cook or Joseph Banks at Kamay (Botany Bay, near Sydney), it may have been obtained from its owner between about 1790 and 1815 and sent to London by a colonial governor or other collector.\nAustralia has been inhabited for at least 60,000 years. Permanent British occupation began in 1788 with a \u2018First Fleet\u2019 of ships carrying convicts to establish a penal colony at present day Sydney. \u00a0The Eora people of the Sydney region suffered the first brunt of British colonisation. Despite loss of population due to disease and frontier violence as well as displacement, Aboriginal people continue to live in the Sydney region maintaining strong bonds with their traditional lands and culture.\nThe shield is the earliest known Aboriginal shield from Australia and has come to symbolise British colonisation of Australia and its ongoing legacy which still affects Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia today.\nRead more about the shield and discussions around this object here.\nYou can explore our new Collecting and empire trail around the Museum when we reopen. The free trail highlights 15 objects and provides more information about each has entered the collection, and more will be added when further galleries are opened. A PDF leaflet with a map is available to help you locate the objects. \u00a0If you stop at each object the trail will take around 60\u201370 minutes to complete. Read more here.\nThe Museum is developing plans for new displays to better acknowledge the intellectual, economic and social origins of the collection, and the future role of the collection in Britain and the world."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/looking-forward-to-reopening/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Looking forward to reopening", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2020-08-17 00:00:00", "text": "From African hats to Maya lintels, our staff, like our visitors, cannot wait to spend time with the collection again when the Museum reopens on 27 August. We asked them to tell us about the objects they\u2019ve been thinking about the most since the Museum closed in March, and why they\u2019re looking forward to seeing them again.\nMonique Pullan, Senior Conservator: textiles and fibres\nHat made of spider\u2019s web, twig, twine and feather. Botswana, late 19th century.\nAs a conservator I am fascinated by the materials objects are made of and how they are constructed. The display of African hats in case 11, Room 25, doesn\u2019t disappoint, with a Botswanan spider web hat and a scarlet disc-shaped isicholo (headdress), worn by married Zulu women made from human hair coated with red ochre.\nCrocheted man\u2019s hat, Cameroon Grasslands, mid-late 20th century.\nPerhaps my favourite is a crocheted Cameroonian ashetu hat with its distinctive protruberances \u2013 each one stiffened by a wooden stick as I discovered during conservation, imitating elaborate knotted hairstyles. Seeing a London busker wearing the very same hat, I smiled at this assertion of ethnic identity, and wondered about a potential lockdown crochet challenge.\nClaudia da Lanca, Project Coordinator: Iraq Scheme\nSculpture of a winged lion (lamassu) from the Assyrian city of Nimrud. 865\u2013860 BC.\nGuardians of everything most sacred, the lamassu have watched over people since the third\u00a0millennium BC. In ancient Assyria (modern-day Iraq), these monumental, human-headed winged bulls and lions were placed at entrances to cities, palaces and temples in the belief that their supernatural powers would ward off any threats. As a society, the feeling of being threatened is something with which we\u2019ve become increasingly familiar, for example by illness, insecurity and separation from loved ones. The lamassu\u2019s compelling presence has endured over thousands of years, and generation after generation, their symbolic imagery as keepers, defenders and protectors perseveres. Before March 2020, in the quiet of the early morning, as I made my way to the Middle East department every day, I felt the watchful gaze of these powerful deities of the past. Now I find myself anticipating their reassuring presence once again.\nBlandine Courel, Research Assistant: Molecular Analysis, Scientific Department\nAmong the objects I cannot wait to see again, the human-headed winged bull sculpture in Room 6 is, like Claudia, at the top of my list. Made of a single piece of gypsum, these half-animal, half-man guardians were usually placed to protect important Assyrian places, such as king\u2019s palaces or cities, from evils. I have always been fascinated by the great civilisations of antiquity, including the Assyrian empire. For me, these beautiful and colossal figures reflect the grandeur of those civilisations. I am enthralled by the powerful imagination and creativity of the craftsmen of the day, expressed by these hybrid creatures with five legs and wings, and their technical skills are revealed in the fineness of the detail.\nAlice Christophe, Benioff Curator of Oceania\nCarved hand made from toromiro wood. Rapa Nui (Easter Island), 18th century.\nWith the Museum reopening approaching, I am counting the days until I am afforded the opportunity to be in the presence of the objects stewarded by the Museum. In particular, I am excited to rediscover a tao\u02bba (treasure) from the island of Rapa Nui (Easter Island), on display in Room 1. This elongated hand, carved in toromiro wood, is one of the earliest pieces from the Pacific region at the Museum. It is said to have been collected by Hitihiti (also known as Mahine), a high-ranking man from the Society Islands who joined Captain James Cook\u2019s crew while they sojourned on Ra\u02bbiatea during the second voyage.\nReaching Rapa Nui aboard the Resolution (Cook\u2019s ship) in 1774, thousands of miles from his home, Hitihiti went ashore and either traded, or was given, this enigmatic wooden hand. He later gave it to Johann Reinhold Forster, the naturalist aboard the Resolution, who subsequently gifted it to the British Museum.\nVivian Hunt, Managing Partner for McKinsey & Company and Museum Trustee\nKerma ware ceramic beaker. The Kingdom of Kush (present-day Sudan) 1750\u20131550 BC.\nWhen I graduated from secondary school, I wanted to study ceramics at The Rhode Island School of Design in America. At my father\u2019s prodding, I chose a different path but, nonetheless, my appreciation for timeless design has remained. That\u2019s why I am looking forward to revisiting the Kerma ware (made in what is now Sudan) pottery beaker in Room 65 when the Museum opens its doors again. The beaker is ancient; it is technically excellent, functional and prized in ritual. Produced in the Kingdom of Kush, a state which ruled the Middle Nile Valley from around 1750\u20131550 BC and threatened pharaonic Egypt, its aesthetic is surprisingly contemporary. For me, it is a reminder that our modern choices are grounded in \u2013 and informed by \u2013 history, and it begs the question \u2018Are we as modern as we think we are?\u2019 I hope not. I would love to think that beauty is not only in the eye of the beholder, but also in my cultural DNA.\nYou can see the beaker when Room 65 reopens later in the year.\nAshley Almeida, Greengross Family Young People\u2019s Programme Manager\nBronze band from the Balawat Gates of Shalmaneser III. Assyria, 858\u2013824BC.\nI\u2019ve always had a fascination with artistry and the techniques that craftspeople use in their work.\u00a0One of the objects that really beautifully and skilfully shows this that I\u2019m keen to see again is the door fittings from the Balawat gates from the ancient kingdom of Assyria (in modern-day Iraq), which date from 858\u2013824 BC.\u00a0Perhaps an odd choice but, as you look closer and see the detail on the trappings on animals and the clothing people wear, one can\u2019t help but be impressed at the skill at being able to emboss such intricate designs on such a massive object and still have them draw the eye.\nTariq Rasheed, Volunteer Tour Guide\nThe Yaxchilan Lintel 25. Carved limestone, Mexico, AD 723\u2013726.\nThis lintel was found in Yaxchilan, a Maya city located in the modern-day state of Chiapas, Mexico. It shows Lady K\u2019ab\u2019al Xook \u2013 the wife of the ruler Shield Jaguar. Lady Xook has just performed a bloodletting ritual.\nThe queen\u2019s head is knocked back as if she is in a trance. From the saucer she holds, a vision of a serpent emerges. The serpent\u2019s mouth holds a warrior who is pointing a spear straight at Lady Xook\u2019s forehead. It seems a connection has been established between Lady Xook and this strange messenger.\nI find this lintel to be intriguing because it reminds me of the dreams we have and the meanings we often try to find in them.\nMuriel Gray, author, broadcaster and Museum Trustee\nHead of Pazuzu. Bronze, Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq), 800\u2013600 BC.\nIn Room 55 there is a case of tiny objects. There are seldom crowds around it, giving the visitor plenty time to contemplate the exquisite, unique and unsettling nature of these treasures. It\u2019s a case of amulets from Mesopotamia. Of them all, my attention always returns to Pazuzu. This is a small cast bronze object dating from 800\u2013600 BC, depicting the terrifying head of the king of demons. His face is the stuff of nightmares, the essence of horror. Such was his power he warded off lesser demons, in this case the female Lamashtu, hunter/killer of women in labour and their babies. I adore him and cannot wait until we meet again.\nWhat are you most looking forward to seeing? Let us know by tweeting us @britishmuseum!\nThe British Museum reopens to the public on 27 August.

Due to increasing urbanisation and the rise in industrialisation (including the spread of gas lighting in England), the evening meal was becoming later and later. Whereas in rural farming communities the day had an early start and finished when the sun went down, wealthier classes, unhindered by such practicalities, were now having dinner closer to 9pm \u2013 with lunch many hours earlier at midday.\nJohn Cochran (fl. 1825\u20131854), after George Raphael Ward, The Most Noble Anna Maria Marchioness of Tavistock. Stipple, etching and engraving, c. 1820\u20131834.\nThe Duchess of Bedford, who was one of Queen Victoria\u2019s ladies-in-waiting, was having none of it. Describing a \u2018sinking feeling\u2019 at about 5pm, she became despondent at the void between lunch and dinner. She requested that some tea, bread and butter and cake was brought to her room in the late afternoon \u2013 and with that one request of a lady\u2019s grumbling stomach, an afternoon ritual was born. Needing very little prompting to find an occasion to squeeze in another cup of tea and a piece of cake, the upper classes ate it up and the fashionable custom soon spread across Britain.\nPublished by John Bowles (c.1701\u20131779), The Tea-Table. Etching and engraving, c. 1710.\nTea and taxes\nWhether you prefer English Breakfast Tea, Earl Grey or Lapsang Souchong, tea is a fundamental component of afternoon tea. British tea-drinking pre-dates the introduction of afternoon tea by a couple of hundred years, having first been popularised in England by King Charles II and his Portuguese wife, Catherine de Braganza, in the 1600s. The initial imports of tea were costly and heavily taxed, procured through the East India Company who maintained a monopoly of the trade, meaning that only the very wealthy could afford it. However, even with a shocking import tax of 119%, by the 18th century, tea drinking had risen by more than a quarter, prompting pressure on the government to reduce tax on it to 12.5%, removing the need for the black market and encouraging the populace to replace gin with tea as the go-to breakfast drink!\nRichard Houston (c. 1721\u20131775), after Philippe Mercier, published by Robert Sayer, Morning. Mezzotint with some etching, c. 1750.\nFrom China to India\nThroughout the Georgian Era the majority of England\u2019s tea was coming from China (via the East India Company), however in the 1830s the first tea estates were established in the north eastern Indian state of Assam. These vast plantations were part of the British colonisation of India and Sri Lanka, with teas like Darjeeling and Ceylon ending the British Empire\u2019s dependence on Chinese imports. This was a shift of power that goes far beyond a single foodstuff and into much wider debates into commodities, colonisation and power. Some say the British Empire was built on tea and tea fuels England even today. For more in-depth explorations into this subject, Lizzie Collingham\u2019s The Hungry Empire delves into many of the links between Britain\u2019s quest for food and the modern world.\nThomas Bewick (1753\u20131828), advert heading for newspapers, for William Wallace, grocer and tea dealer. Wood engraving, 1787.\nThe material culture of tea\nBy the Victorian era (1837\u20131901), tea drinking had become heavily engrained in the English home. It was a beverage enjoyed by all echelons of society, however, one way in which the tea experience differed was in the material culture of the table. Tea drinking for the wealthy came with a whole host of accessories \u2013 fine porcelain teacups, bowls and saucers, decorative teapots, mahogany tea caddies, silver tea urns, exquisite table linens and personalised tea blends. For them, the afternoon tea table was one of great opulence and refinement, a place to express your identity, interests and taste.\nJules Jacquemart (1837\u20131880), printed by Auguste Del\u00e2tre, Porcelaine tendre fran\u00e7aise (French soft-paste porcelain) from the series Vingt-six planches \u00e0 l\u2019eau-forte grav\u00e9es pour l\u2019histoire de la porcelain (Twenty-six etchings for the history of porcelain). Etching, c. 1860.\nMilk and porcelain\nThere are two types of people in the world: those who put the milk in first, and those who begin with the tea and add the milk second. While I am definitely in the latter category (like any rational human), in previous centuries adding the milk first had a practical function. The fine porcelain cups and tea bowls of18thand19th-century England needed the cool milk added first to prevent them from shattering from the sudden heat of the tea. Nowadays however, I think our heavy-set mugs can take it!\nTea Bowl, c.1720.\nPorcelain, gold, silver and enamel tea bowl and saucer. Made at the Meissen Porcelain Factory. Germany, c. 1720.\nTea, coffee and freedom\nFragile teacups aside, I believe that Victorian afternoon tea could be considered a radical feminist act. While coffee occupied a more masculine external world in 19th-century London, the interior realms of tea were a more feminine affair. Afternoon tea allowed women to entertain mixed company at home without their husbands and was therefore liberating, both socially and practically. This freedom continued into the dresses they were wearing, which were designed to be worn indoors, in the intimate company of friends and family and away from the public eye. As a result, they used less boning to hold their shape and were made of light, flowing fabrics. Free from some of the Victorian era\u2019s performative and literal corsetry, afternoon tea was a place where women took centre stage and were able to exchange ideas, opinions and a healthy dose of gossip.\nAnthony Cardon (1772\u20131813), after Maria Cosway, published by Ackermann, Last the grey Dowager, in ancient flounces from the series Progress of Female Dissipation. Etching and aquatint on paper, 1800.\nTypes of tea\nToday when we think of afternoon tea we likely think of upscale hotels and restaurants, special occasions and a seated affair. However, what we imagine as a classic afternoon tea is really an amalgamation of a multitude of Victorian customs. The Victorians had a number of versions of \u2018tea\u2019; they had \u2018at-home\u2019 teas, which were often a riotous, standing-room only affair \u2013 as captured in Joseph Swain\u2019s tea-party illustration below.\nJoseph Swain (1820\u20131909), after George Du Maurier, illustration in London Society. Wood engraving, 1862.\nHowever, the \u2018at-home tea\u2019 could also be performed as a \u2018simple tea\u2019 with a modest menu and only family for company. Which brings me on to \u2018family teas\u2019, which acted as a sort of evening meal in more middle-class households, but was also in the afternoon, meaning you could still refer to it as an \u2018afternoon tea\u2019. Conversely some refer to this as \u2018high tea\u2019 and that could be formal or informal. Confused? Understandable! In this and many ways afternoon tea is a moveable feast, it\u2019s a social act, full of ritual and performance, but one that changed across class and county lines. (We better not get started on the whole debate about cream or jam first on scones!) Nevertheless, the unifying customs are that there should be sweets and savouries, tea and pleasantries, it should be around 5pm and corsets are optional.\nMy perfect menu\nYou didn\u2019t think I\u2019d finish before mentioning cucumber sandwiches, did you? Even in the Victorian Era, cucumber sandwiches were on the afternoon tea menu. In fact, most of us would recognise the 19th-century afternoon tea as something similar to what we have today \u2013 finger sandwiches with assorted fillings, savory tarts and pastries, a variety of fancy cakes, scones and tea. For the full Victorian experience, you might want to include a glass of sherry or a nice claret. Also, sandwich-wise, you could be a bit more adventurous and go for anchovy, sardine or maybe even beef tongue. Meanwhile, for the cakes, seed cake is a timeless choice, almond cakes or madeira a safe bet, or the later classic \u2013 a Victoria sponge which, according to the legendary Mrs Beeton, was \u2018seasonable at any time\u2019.\nVictorian Afternoon Tea at the V&A, designed by Tasha Marks in collaboration with Benugo, 2016.

Nearly 2,000 years later it was discovered carbonised, still inside the oven, during excavations at the archaeological site in 1930.\nAs part of our 2013 Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition, we challenged chef Giorgio Locatelli to make a recreation of that loaf in his London kitchen. Follow the process in the video above.\nIf you\u2019re keen to do some historical baking too, here\u2019s the recipe. This makes quite a large loaf that was baked in a professional kitchen, so you may find halving the ingredients makes for easier baking at home.\nIngredients\n600g biga acida (sourdough)\n4 tsp sugar\n4 tsp salt\nc. 500ml water\n500g spelt or buckwheat flour\n500g wholemeal or plain flour\nMethod\nMix the wholemeal and spelt flours together, and pour this on to your work surface. Create a large depression in the centre.\nDissolve the salt and sugar into the water. Mix the sourdough into the flour bit by bit, pouring it into the well you\u2019ve just created. Once the sourdough is roughly mixed, begin to pour the water into the well slowly, mixing gently with your hands. Mix until all the water is gone, and any excess flour is incorporated into the dough. You will end up with a rough ball.\nStart kneading the dough gently, folding it back on itself so it can \u2018take in\u2019 some air. Knead for a few minutes until you can form it into a smooth ball.\nFlatten the ball slightly as in the video, and transfer it to an oiled baking tray. Cover it, and leave it to rise for 1.5\u20132 hours in a warm room. While you\u2019re waiting, perhaps investigate some other ancient recipes to enjoy your bread with!\nThe next two steps are optional, but if you\u2019re going for historical accuracy here, they\u2019re a must. Cut a piece of string long enough to go round your risen dough, with a bit left over to tie a knot. Wrap the string around the sides of the dough, pull it tight so it makes a lip around the side, and tie a knot to secure it.\nNow, take a knife to score the top into eight equal segments. Real loaves from the Roman period were often stamped too. If you want, now\u2019s the time to add your own stamp. It could be your initials or whatever you want, but bear in mind that your stamp must be oven-proof, and will need to be weighed down during baking with something heavy (like baking beans wrapped in foil).\nBake for 30\u201345 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius (around 400 degrees Fahrenheit). Keep an eye on your loaf so it doesn\u2019t come out looking carbonised like the one from Herculaneum!\nLet it cool and enjoy your Roman bread!\nWe\u2019d love to see your efforts if you try the recipe \u2013 tag us on Twitter and Instagram @britishmuseum.\nTake a trip back to our 2013 Life and death in Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition in our broadcast from inside the show.

It attracts the most adventurous and intrepid visitors. A brilliant green ribbon of cultivation runs along the river\u2019s edge, while the settlement\u2019s one and two-storey mudbrick and stone houses sit perched haphazardly on the uneven rocky hillside on a desert terrace overlooking the Nile. No two buildings are alike and some are fortified.\nOne and two-storey houses of mudbrick and stone, with barrel-vaulted roofing (c. 12th\u201313th century) are dotted across the hillside. \u00a9 D A Welsby\nKulubnarti is in Makuria, a powerful medieval Nubian kingdom ruling the middle Nile valley. It was converted to Christianity in the 6th century AD by missionaries from the Byzantine empire, bringing a tremendous cultural change to the area. Churches, monasteries and cathedrals replaced earlier temples and rituals to pagan gods and the dead were no longer accompanied by goods for the afterlife. In the 8th and 7th centuries BC, this was an area ruled by the Kushite pharaohs. At its height, their empire encompassed Egypt and extended from the Mediterranean to upstream of the Sixth Nile Cataract, but now their traditions and beliefs, and those of their successors, have been swept away.\nThe Nubians held back the Arab armies that entered North Africa in the 7th century AD, negotiating a peace accord called the \u2018Baqt\u2019. Nubian forces are skilled archers, and called \u2018pupil-smiters\u2019 by their enemies for their great accuracy in hitting the centre of the eye. Ouch! Now, helped by 500 years of relative peaceful coexistence with their Muslim neighbours to the north (Fatimid Egypt), the Nubian economy, crafts, and arts are booming. Makuria is a kingdom \u2018with beautiful buildings, churches and monasteries, many palm-trees, vines, gardens, cultivated fields and broad pastures on which one can see camels\u2019 \u2013 Ibn Selim Al-Aswani, Egyptian diplomat, 10th century AD.\nCamel herd grazing in the fields with egrets perched on their backs. \u00a9 Berber-Abidiya Archaeological Project\nWhen to visit\nKulubnarti is a place of climatic extremes and very little rainfall, and the best time to visit is early or late in the winter. Strong chill winds, alternating with calm periods filled with swarms of small biting flies, can make the mid-winter months rather unpleasant. Annually, between June and September, the river rises, flooding the lands beside the banks with fertile silt. The inundation sometimes makes travel through the river\u2019s rapids easier, but the scorching heat at the height of summer can be unbearable.\nGetting there\nMost visitors arrive at the city by following the Nile in boats and overland. The river is a conduit for people, trade and ideas, and flows south to north connecting central Africa and the Mediterranean. If you arrive at Kulubnarti from the south going downstream, you will have to traverse several cataracts of rocks and rough water, but this route enables you to visit the fortified urban metropolis of the Makurian capital Tungul (Old Dongola) with its many churches and monasteries. We\u2019d encourage you to sample the wine there, and perhaps purchase a set of pottery bowls for your table from their famous kilns \u2013 you\u2019ll find plates and cups decorated with fish, doves, crosses, palm fronds, or even gazelles.\nThrone-hall of the Makurian kings in the capital Tungul (Old Dongola). The building was converted to a mosque in 1317. \u00a9 D A Welsby\nIf you are coming from the north, upstream towards Kulubnarti, the river moves swiftly through rocks and boulders. The rapids in the Second Nile Cataract can be impassable and dangerous, so you\u2019ll have to unload your boat and go overland. You will pass several isolated walled monastic communities in the Batn el-Hajar, and no doubt, see crocodiles on the riverbanks enjoying the sun, or waiting just below the water surface. Don\u2019t stray too far away from the river into the desert though, dying of thirst is a very real possibility.\nIf, after visiting Kulubnarti, you plan to continue onward south to Tungul, beware. The Makurian kingdom has a trade monopoly and maintains a rigid control of traders. From the Egyptian border you can move freely to the area of Kulubnarti, but permission from the Makurian King is needed if you wish to venture further upstream, and you will likely be searched. If you refuse, the punishment can be death. Smuggling is not tolerated.\nNile crocodile on the river bank, northern Sudan. \u00a9 N Spencer\nNortheast area of Kulubnarti. \u00a9 D A Welsby\nFood and drink\nDespite there being only a small amount of cultivated land in Kulubnarti, there is an abundance of fresh, locally grown produce including dates, figs, bananas, pulses, onions and cucumbers. The many saqia waterwheels along the river\u2019s edge, turned by a patiently plodding bull or pair of bulls, ensure the agricultural fields remain well watered.\nBe sure to try the local sorghum (dhurra) flat bread made on hot ceramic plates, and the thick, fermented sorghum porridge. Nile fish are a staple food, and meats and milk are available. It\u2019s highly recommended you try one of the hearty local stews. Camel meat, either sun-dried or fresh, boiled in milk is a delicacy. Green beans (l\u016bbiy\u0101) and bread soaked in meat broth, with meat chunks, roots and leaves added to complete the dish, is another. Accompanied by some sorghum or millet beer, they\u2019re delicious meals for a weary traveller. If you drink too much you may end up joining in a singalong, with some of the residents, a favoured entertainment!\nWhere to stay\nWhen it\u2019s hot, most people sleep outside under the stars on palm mats or on wooden beds with palm ropes lashed to the frame for support. If it\u2019s cold, it might be possible to rent a room for the night or if you\u2019re lucky, a friendly resident or one of the local worthies will welcome you into their home. \u00a0The mudbrick house walls radiate heat at night and will help protect you from the elements. You may want to sleep with an oil lamp for company, because the rooms are dark and have small windows. The nights are tranquil interrupted only by braying donkeys, barking dogs and bellowing camels.\nUtilitarian medieval Nubian tableware: a large communal bowl and a serving ladle.\nSaucer lamp with a central reservoir for the lamp oil and three wicks.\nThings to do\nMost people explore Kulubnarti on foot. It is easy to take in the sights this way, experience the peaceful rhythm of daily pastoral life, and enjoy the natural beauty of the countryside, where\u00a0snowy, white egrets hunt prey in the flooded fields beside the city, and migrating flocks of stork wheel around the sky.\nIn the adjacent desert, large sand dunes cascade over dark boulders. Look for the ancient and more recent boat graffiti on the rocky outcrops.\nSandy dunes in the Kulubnarti countryside and a rocky outcrop near the river with boat graffiti inscribed on it.\n\u00a9 D A Welsby\nThe river has been central to life here for hundreds of years, just as it is today. Wooden boats move back and forth along the Nile, some carrying goods for local trade \u2013 large baskets full of grain and dates \u2013 while from others fishermen toss their nets drawing up catches of Nile perch and bolti fish. While wandering around you may also see trade caravans coming and going, carrying slaves, exotic animals such as giraffes and monkeys, leopard skins, gold, frankincense and ebony northward to market, and transporting oil and wine amphorae, cloth bolts, wheat and barley similarly southward.\nVisit the community church\nHave a look inside the small mudbrick church on the low terrace next to the fields. Columns divide the interior into three parallel aisles for a small congregation. There is an apse at the east end of the central aisle, over which sits a dome. Beautiful wall paintings of saints, apostles, biblical stories, archangels, and the Nativity with Mary, Joseph, Jesus, the shepherds and angels, decorate the plastered walls in a rich array of colours. The Nubian artistic style, a mixture of Coptic, Syro-Palestinian, Byzantine and local Nubian influences, is unique and captivating.\nThe Kulubnarti Church sits among the rocks beside the cultivation. \u00a9 D A Welsby\nOther visitors to the church have celebrated their visits here by leaving graffiti, writing their names and those of saints and angels, or short prayers in Greek, Coptic and Old Nubian, perhaps to commemorate part of a pilgrimage journey southward to the Monastery of Saint Anthony the Great at Tungul for healing, or northward through Egypt and beyond, to the distant holy city of Jerusalem. If you are fortunate enough to be here on 10 Tybi (10 January) you can enjoy the festival of Saint Anna, a well-known Makurian saint, revered for their piety, now buried in a crypt at Tungul.\nPortion of the wall painting of the Nativity with Joseph on the left and an angel on the right. Now in the Sudan National Museum.\nEntertainment\nIf you\u2019re in the mood for something adventurous, take the opportunity to improve both your fitness and your prowess with a bow and arrow. Go trekking through the nearby desert with skilled Nubian archers stalking and hunting swift and elusive gazelle. The meat is tasty, and the neighbourhood monks will appreciate having the gazelle skins to make parchment.\nFor a relaxing break, spend a day on the river collecting Nile oysters \u2013 their shells make great spoons and pendants \u2013 or board a fishing boat and float gently along with the current, casting nets or hooks and lines into the river, hoping for a successful catch.\nShopping\nBe prepared to barter with the merchants. Unlike further north, coinage is not accepted here and goods are purchased by exchange, so bring something like glass, silk or iron tools to trade.\nSkilled artisans make wool clothing, saddle tack, baskets, tools and sandals, sturdy, practical products for everyday use. Don\u2019t expect extravagant luxury goods as few end up here. Look for the upright looms, spindle whorls, weights and awls \u2013 spinning, weaving, basketry and leatherworking are important industries, and materials are sourced locally. If you\u2019ve lost your comb, need to pin up your hair, or add a toggle pin to your clothes, this is also the place to pick one up.\nFrom left to right: A tool from the local weaving trade (spindle whorl), a highly polished ebony comb, two carefully carved wooden hair or toggle pins.\nFor added protection on your travels consider getting a leather or cloth amulet with a sacred magical text folded and sewn inside. They are said to protect the wearer from a wide variety of ills and creatures. They come in several styles and shapes from square, to cylindrical, round or rectangular and are often covered with stamped or inked decorations. You\u2019ll notice many of Kulubnarti\u2019s residents are wearing these, usually attached to leather necklaces, armlets and anklets, or sewn on to their clothes. Don\u2019t buy a ready made amulet. To make sure you\u2019re getting a genuine amulet and not a fake, have one made for you. Alternatively, you could purchase a lamp or bowl inscribed with the name, monogram or cryptogram of an archangel. Michael, the patron saint of Nubia, and Raphael are popular choices.\nPot shard from a bowl with magical symbols and the monogram of the archangel Raphael drawn on it in the centre.\nWe hope you had fun on your journey to 12th-century Sudan!\nIn the mood for more time travelling?

It is in a plain area between the hills of Beta Giyorgis, to the north west, and May Qoho, to the north east.\nThe city itself extends over an area of more than 1.2 square kilometres and is the largest city in this region.

You should disembark at Adulis and then travel inland. Walking will take you at least five days but you can always hire a donkey. While in Adulis, don\u2019t forget to visit the local churches and look at the ancient stele erected by the Egyptian king Ptolemy III to commemorate his campaigns in the region over 800 years ago.\nBy river\nAlternatively, you may also choose to travel from Lower (northern) Egypt, by gently sailing up the Nile River. Make sure that you disembark after the city of Swenett (also known as Syene) and before the First Cataract (an area of rapids) as your boat might not be able to sail successfully through it. From here we\u2019d recommend you hire a camel to continue your journey. On your way down the Nile you could visit the Nubian kingdoms of Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia. You can purchase souvenirs such as textiles or a lamp from most of the towns you will pass along the way, or get yourself a tattoo to remember your trip by!\nPottery lamp, Sudan. AD 500\u2013600.\nBy land\nYou can also reach Aksum by traveling inland, but this route is risky and not recommended. If you disembark in North Africa, make sure you don\u2019t anger the Vandals, who migrated from northern Europe and conquered these regions in AD 435. They sometimes persecute adherents to monotheistic religions such as Christianity and Manichaeism.\nIf you are travelling from West Africa you should avoid getting lost in the Sahara Desert as the route is not well known. You could try asking the Garamantes who live in the desert for help, but little is known about their kingdom, so they may or may not be willing or able to assist you.\nA baggage train as depicted in a 15th- or early 16th-century Ethiopian manuscript. Private collection.\nGetting around\nMost people travel on foot in Aksum, but you could hire a donkey or a camel, or pay someone to carry your baggage.\nUseful Information\nLanguage\nMost people in Aksum speak a Semitic language called Ge\u02bdez. It is written from left to right like Greek and Latin, but it uses symbols that may stand for a syllable or a consonant. If you can\u2019t speak Ge\u02bdez you should be able to hire a merchant who speaks Ancient Greek as a translator and guide.\nReligion\nMost of the population of Aksum became Christian after the Ethiopian King Ezana converted to this new religion in the mid-4th century AD, but locals claim that Christianity was first introduced here by an Ethiopian eunuch who was baptized by Saint Philip the Evangelist (Acts 8:26-40). The Kingdom of Aksum was therefore one of the world\u2019s earliest Christian states. By around AD 350, the Archbishop of Alexandria had appointed a Syrian called Frumentius as bishop of Aksum. Christian texts were translated from Greek into the local language, Ge\u2019ez. There are many churches in and around the city and many people wear a cross around their neck.\nGerman miniature by an anonymous artist showing Saint Philip baptising the Ethiopian Eunuch. Bodycolour on vellum, around 1615\u20131635.\nHow to pay\nPeople prefer to use local coins which are minted using silver and copper. If you have a taste for luxury, Aksum is one of the few states that produces gold coins. Trade and foreign currencies are also accepted, but watch out for some forgeries that are in circulation across the Red Sea region!\nAn Aksumite gold coin featuring King Kaleb on the obverse and reverse. Around 500\u2013525.\nThings to see and do in Aksum\nCathedral of Mary of Zion\nThe Cathedral of Mary of Zion (Maryam Tsion) rests on a massive stepped base measuring about 66 metres long and at least 41 metres wide. Like churches built across Europe and the Middle East during this period, it is oriented east to west. Some locals maintain that it was built by King Kaleb (fl. AD 500), while others say that is was built by the legendary King brothers Abraha and Atsbaha, who, according to local traditions, climbed a nearby mountain to pray for a revelation about where to build the cathedral. While they were praying, they had a vision of Christ who filled a large lake with earth allowing the brothers to build the church on top of it. Locals consider it as the mother of all the other churches in the country and believe that the Ark of the Covenant is kept in its sanctuary. Unfortunately, visitors are not allowed inside the sanctuary, but you can still walk around the surrounding gardens.\nArchitectural fragments from the now-ruined Cathedral of Mary of Zion including a lion-shaped gargoyle.\nThe thrones and inscriptions\nIf you walk outside the precincts of the Cathedral of Mary of Zion you will come across several large stone thrones. Like the church itself, the thrones are placed on stepped bases which measure around 2 metres by 2 metres. The thrones are surmounted by a thatched roof supported by stone pillars. Many of them bear inscriptions in Ge\u02bdez, which commemorate the deeds and conquests of the kings of Aksum. There are also freestanding commemorative inscriptions which are sometimes written in Greek to allow travellers to read them.\nInscription from Aksum written using the Greek, Ge\u02bdez, and Sabean alphabets and commemorating the deeds of King Ezana.

Creative Commons.\nStelae field\nFrom the Cathedral, walk a short distance northwards and you will find yourself facing some of the largest monolithic carvings to have been ever erected in the world. This area is known as the stelae field.\nThe stelae mark the burials of some of the prominent figures of the Aksumite state. The three largest ones are elaborately carved with reliefs that imitate the doors, windows, and wooden beams of Aksumite palaces. Unfortunately, the largest of the stelae, to the west, has fallen down due to its weight of over 520 tonnes (equal to more than 50 elephants!).\nThe dark underground tombs are entered through corridors that give access to a series of side-chambers. In the unlikely case that you are granted access to the tombs you\u2019d better bring a torch if you want to explore this subterranean area.\nModern photo showing a portion of the toppled stele with the smaller stelae in the background. The stelea date from around 3rd-4th centuries.\nThe palaces\nMost of the houses in Aksum are small in size and are built using un-dressed mud-set stone and timber for the doors and windows. There are, however, several large palaces in and around the city which we\u2019d recommend visiting. The largest of these is Ta\u2018akha Maryam which extends over 10,000 square metres. Another large structure, to the west of the Cathedral of Mary of Zion, is Dungur. The palaces are built in a distinct Aksumite fashion by using dressed stone, rubble, mud, and timber beams.\nModern photo of the ruins of the palace of Dungur. Around 5th\u20137th centuries AD.\nPhoto: A. Savin. Wikimedia Commons.\nThe surrounding area\nThe Monastery of Dabra Dammo\nLike the palaces of Aksum, some of the churches of the Aksumite empire are also built using stones and timber beams. You can see an example of this style of building by visiting the main church of the monastery of Debra Dammo, which is located about 60 kilometres east of Aksum. In this church, timber beams are set at regular intervals in parallel to the line of the wall and are kept in place with shorter perpendicular wooden beams with rounded ends that stick out of the wall. Some locals say that the rounded ends of these beams look like \u2018monkey\u2019s heads\u2019.\nModern photo of the church of Dabra Dammo. Photo: A.Savin. Creative Commons.\nThe monastery of Dabra Dammo is situated at the top of a flat mountain with a sheer cliff-face. To reach the top you must pull yourself up a 15-metre rock face with a rope. So make sure you\u2019re feeling up to the test before setting out. According to the monks, the founder of their monastery, Abuna Aregawi, was able to reach the top of the mountain by getting a snake to pull him up. He was part of a group of monks known as the \u2018Nine Saints\u2019.\nMengesha Fiseha, painting on cotton showing Abuna Aregawi being pulled up by a snake to the top of Dabra Dammo. Ethiopia, 2007\u20132008. \u00a9 Mengesha Fiseha.\nThe Monastery of Abba Garima\nThe Monastery of Abba Garima, another member of the Nine Saints, can be reached by travelling on foot for two days eastwards on the road to Adulis. Some of the manuscripts in this monastery are dazzlingly illustrated with portraits of holy men. You could politely ask the monks to show them to you. The area surrounding this monastery is dotted with churches if you feel like exploring. Some churches are perched at the top of high mountains, so be prepared to do a lot of climbing!\nPortrait of a Holy Man from the Garima Gospels. Around 5th\u20136th centuries AD.\nPhoto: Michael Gervers.\nTrekking\nThe landscape around Aksum is breath-taking and, for those who like the outdoors, perfect for trekking. The Semien mountains, 50 kilometres southwest of Aksum, have incredible views. Make sure to also look out for the troops of baboons that live in this area. These territories are not under Aksum\u2019s control, so you travel here at your own risk.\nA modern photo of the view from the Semien mountains.\nEntertainment\nNot much has been written about the customs of the locals but going by the 6th-century Greek Chronicle of John Malalas, the procession of the Aksumite kings is especially magnificent if you are lucky enough to witness one. The king is said to wear gold threaded linen and a tunic decorated with pearls. He has bangles and necklaces made of gold and travels on a chariot pulled by four elephants.\nObverse of a coin showing an enthroned Aksumite king holding a cross-sceptre and wearing an elaborate crown. Around 600\u2013630.\nShopping\nAksum is a vibrant commercial centre which has access to goods imported from the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean through the Red Sea port of Adulis. You can buy glassware, beads, metalwork with glass inlays, carved wood, pottery, both locally made and imported. The Aksumite Empire is particularly well known for its carved elephant ivory, but it\u2019s quite expensive.\nAn Aksumite jar. Around 3rd\u20134th century.\nEating and drinking\nThere is plenty of good food and drink to try in the city. The Aksumites make oil using the plant guizotia abyssinica and grow a number of edible crops such as emmer wheat, barley, lentils, chickpeas, grapes, and oats. While you are in town you should try injera \u2013 a large flat pancake that is made using fermented flour and water. This flour is made by grinding the tiny seeds of an indigenous plant called teff (a type of cereal grass).\nDigital photograph showing painted rock art of a cow with curved horns. Saka Sharifa, Ethiopia. Photographed by David Coulson.\nThe Aksumites also eat meat and herd chickens, sheep, and goats as well as zebu \u2013 a humped ox that was also depicted in rock art in the nearby regions. People around Aksum also keep Sanga cattle, which are noticeable for their very large horns.\nArtist\u2019s interpretation of \u2018The Sanga\u2019.

This is made by adding powdered buckthorn leaves to a mixture of honey and water for flavour and fermentation. The drink is delicious, but also quite strong.\nWe hope you enjoyed your trip to Aksum!\nIn the mood for more time travelling?

Travelling with Pacific collections curator Julie Adams and scientist Chris Mussell, the main aim of the trip was to share and exchange knowledge about the heva t\u016bp\u0101p\u0101\u2019u, or chief mourner\u2019s costume, from Tahiti, which had been such a significant project for us over the past two years.\nSharing our research\nMade of barkcloth, feather, pearl shell and coconut shell, the heva t\u016bp\u0101p\u0101\u2019u was acquired by Captain Cook during his second visit to Tahiti in 1774. It is a rare survival of a tradition that came to an end shortly after this time, and no complete historic costumes survive in French Polynesia. It would have been worn during ceremonies mourning the death of a chief in 18th-century Tahiti. Cook collected this costume on his second voyage (1772\u20131775) in HMS Resolution, when Tahitian chiefs agreed to receive sacred red feathers from Tonga in exchange for the mourner\u2019s costume. Very few of these costumes survive, so this is one of the most important objects in the collection. You can read more about this fascinating costume and its recent conservation and research here.\nTahitian Mourner\u2019s costume. Spectacular costumes of this kind were witnessed during Cook\u2019s voyages as being worn by a \u2018chief mourner\u2019 as part of funerary and mortuary rituals.\nThrough a series of public lectures, press interviews and discussions with museums, cultural groups, artists and artisans, and even our local taxi driver, we presented the recent study, conservation and scientific investigations into the costume in our collection.\nOver the course of the trip I came to realise the extent to which knowledge of pre-Christian Tahitian culture had been lost following the influence of missionaries in the early 19th century, and the banning of many religious and ceremonial practices and beliefs. Since the 1980s has there been an increasing resurgence of interest among Tahitians in their traditional culture, encompassing history, arts and crafts, language, music and dance, and tattoo, and we were keen to seek out many of these leading voices during our time there. With so much of the historic material culture destroyed or passed out of the country, opportunities to make connections to the past through objects like the heva t\u016bp\u0101p\u0101\u2019u are all the more important.\nPresenting work on the Tahitian mourner\u2019s costume at the Centre des Metiers d\u2019Art (left) and at the James Norman Hall Museum (right), Tahiti, November 2019.\nThe people we met were overwhelmingly welcoming and interested in the Museum\u2019s research, in particular expressing their thanks to the team for bringing this information back to Tahiti.\nExchanging stories\nThe trip gave us the opportunity to take part in conversations with Tahitians about the heva t\u016bp\u0101p\u0101\u2019u, to hear their responses to the costume and thoughts on the cultural significance of materials and colours, who might have made and worn it, and how it would have offered protection to the chief mourner during his confrontations with the spirit world.\nOne of these discussions was with Hinatea Colombani, who together with her husband Moe, has set up the wonderful Arioi Cultural Centre in Papar\u0101 on the main island of Tahiti. At the centre they run Tahitian cultural workshops and develop links with local schools, aiming to inspire the next generation to take a greater interest in their heritage.\nHinatea and Moe Colombani shared their thoughts on the heva t\u016bp\u0101p\u0101\u2019u.\nAt the age of eight I was able to see the image of the mourner in a book for the first time. This impressive costume was intimidating through the eyes and even more with its name HEVA T\u016aP\u0100P\u0100\u2019U to the understanding of a little girl this name reasons directly with the ghosts. Unfortunately, no one at the time could tell me more, when I was already curious to know and understand my culture. The presentation and the meeting with the BM team transported me to this moment of my childhood but this time with the knowledge necessary to understand and learn again. These exchanges are of great importance so that we rediscover our culture through this scientific research.\nHinatea Colombani, Arioi Cultural Centre\nFor Hinatea, having only ever seen pictures in books, being able to see each element in detail finally enabled her to start making more sense of the heva t\u016bp\u0101p\u0101\u2019u. She speculated how by wearing feathers, the chief mourner might have \u2018teased\u2019 the spirits into thinking he was a bird, a messenger of the gods, enabling him to move freely between Po (the spirit world) and Ao (world of the people).\nA Tahitian man wearing a mourner\u2019s dress, understood to be the one in the British Museum collection. Lithograph, 19th century.\nThe wrapping of the body of the chief mourner in so many layers of barkcloth and feather reminded her of to\u2019o, god images wrapped in sennet, barkcloth and feather for protection, while the iridescent pearl shell face mask and breast plate might have reflected light so the spirits couldn\u2019t catch and trap your soul. She felt strongly that \u2018the opportunity for not only children, but also adults who don\u2019t know about their history [to learn about] old ceremonies, and symbols of the old ceremonies, is important, because they have been too influenced by colonisation and Christianity, and now we have to tell the truth.\u2019 As she so wonderfully ended our conversation, the heva t\u016bp\u0101p\u0101\u2019u may have once been \u2018the symbol between two worlds, the Po and Ao, but maybe now it is the symbol of the past, the present, and even the future\u2019.\nHinatea and Moe Colombani shared their thoughts on the heva t\u016bp\u0101p\u0101\u2019u.\nHearing thoughts on the costume like these certainly adds to our understanding and interpretation of the costume, but meeting Tahitians like Hinatea also reaffirmed for me, as a conservator at the Museum, just why, and for who, we are preserving the collections. It confirmed the value of carrying out detailed technical documentation of objects as part of conservation treatments, and just how important it is that this information is made accessible. Seeing objects as part of a living culture, and understanding what makes them important to that culture, will help me make better decisions in my conservation treatments.\nGod images, or to\u2019o, such as this, were wrapped and bound in protective layers of barkcloth, leaf, or as in this case, cordage made from finely spun sennit (coconut husk fibre), in order to protect and contain the deities inhabiting them. The multiple protective layers reminded Hinatea of the layers of the heva tu papa\u2019u. Society Islands, French Polynesia.\nMaking barkcloth\nWhile we were at the Arioi Centre we couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to take part in one of their barkcloth-making sessions. Many of the elements of the heva t\u016bp\u0101p\u0101\u2019u are made of barkcloth, and I was eager to learn more about this material, known as ahu in Tahitian.\nMany elements of heva t\u016bp\u0101p\u0101\u2019u are made of barkcloth, ranging from the thicker and more fibrous cloth of the main tiputa (poncho style garments) to the very thin and delicate cloth of the waist sash.\nBarkcloth is made by beating the inner bark of certain types of tree to form a thin and supple material \u2013 which can be joined to form large sheets.\nA shell was used to scrape the outer bark from slim branches of the aute, before peeling away the inner bark. Grooves cut into the wooden beaters helped spread out the fibres and produced distinctive pattern.\nWe tried our hands at making ahu using bark stripped from the aute (paper mulberry), uru (breadfruit) and ora (banyan) trees. Hinatea and Moe took us through the stages, from scraping off the outer bark the traditional way using a shell, to peeling off the inner bark and beating it with wooden beaters. It was hard work, but it was rewarding to see how my small section of bark expanded into a supple creamy white sheet of cloth.\nBeating the barkcloth.\nReflecting back to the incredibly fine barkcloth on the waist sash of the mourners costume I could understand just why cloth of that quality and quantity was highly prized, and was in awe of the skill of the people who had made it.\nThe fine barkcoth on the waist sash of the heva tu papa\u2019u, made from beaten aute, showed the marks from the beater.\nBarkcloth production had effectively died out in Tahiti by the end of the 19th century, and is only recently making a comeback. Like most of today\u2019s practitioners in Tahiti, Hinatea and Moe had learned their skills from makers in Hawaii, Samoa, and the Marquesas Islands. They are also planting and cultivating the necessary aute (paper mulberry or broussenetia papyrifera) trees on their land, at one time so abundant across the islands, but now scarce.\nThe Arioi Cultural Centre runs Tahitian cultural workshops including dance, music, cookery and barkcloth making.\nExploring natural dyes\nChris dyed his fingers scarlet with mati, made from grinding tou leaf and mati berries.\nMoe also showed us how to make some of the natural dyes they are using to colour and decorate barkcloth, including a bright scarlet produced by grinding leaves of the tou tree with mati berries. Having read about this scarlet mati in botanist Joseph Banks\u2019 Journals during his time on Tahiti on Cook\u2019s first voyage, it was great to see it for real. We collected samples of the various dyes to bring back to the Museum \u2013 these will be added to the reference collection of traditional plant dyes, helping scientists here confirm identifications in the future.\nLeft: Moe burning ti\u2019a\u2019iri, candlenut (aleurites moluccanus) to create an oily soot used as a black pigment. Centre: Unfortunately the purple colour produced by the sap from a cut leaf stem of the fe\u2019i (a type of banana) is light sensitive and quickly turns brown. Right: A sample board showing some of the natural plant dyes used at the Arioi Centre, with the Tahitian names for the plant and dye.\nDiscovered folded underneath the costume during the 2018 conservation treatment, this large piece of barkcloth was most likely associated with the mourning ceremony in some way. Dyed a now faded yellow using morindia citrofolia, it is covered with finger and handprints in a reddish brown dye, which was also identified as being morindia citrofolia.\nIn turn Hinatea and Moe were interested to hear about the various dyes and colours we had identified on the heva t\u016bp\u0101p\u0101\u2019u, in particular the use of the dye citrofolia morindia. Called nono in Tahitian, this is known today as a yellow dye, but the fact that British Museum scientist Diego Tamburini had identified it as both a yellow and a reddish brown colour on several of the parts of the costume led us to speculate how this would have been achieved in practice. The addition of ground coral to change the pH in order to alter the colour was suggested, and we left Moe keen to experiment further.\nLeft: Nono root produces a yellow dye. Right: Our kitchen experiments trying to work out how a red and yellow dye was produced from the nono.\nVisiting the sacred site of Marae Taputapu\u0101tea\nOne of the many highlights of the trip for me was a visit to the large marae complex of Taputapu\u0101tea on the neighbouring island of Ra\u2019iatea. A marae is communal sacred place used for religious, ceremonial, political and social purposes in Polynesian society. They were places where the world of the living intersected the world of the ancestors and the gods. Built between the 14th and 18th centuries, the marae complex at Taputapu\u0101tea \u2013 now a UNESCO World Heritage site \u2013 was perhaps the most important marae in the whole of Polynesia. A stone from here is said to lie within all other marae.\nThe marae complex at Taputapu\u0101tea\nTaputapu\u0101tea comprises a number of roughly rectangular areas paved with blocks of black larval stone, bordered by walls of standing stones, and some with raised platforms.\nTaputapu\u0101tea would have undoubtedly been familiar to Tupaia, the Tahitian who acted as Captain Cook\u2019s guide and navigator during his first voyage, and who came from Raiatea. His drawing of the chief mourner, now in the British Library\u2019s collection was one of our key resources in redisplaying the heva t\u016bp\u0101p\u0101\u2019u. Standing here looking across the stones a shiver ran down my spine, as I felt a direct connection to him and to the chief mourner, who may well have inhabited this space too.\nDrawing by Tupaia showing a woman dancing and the Chief Mourner.

With them we are exploring the feasibility of commissioning a new feather cloak to display as part of the costume, in place of the original which is now too fragile for further travel or exposure \u2013 a very exciting project.\nStaff and students at the Arioi Cultural Centre gave us a wonderful welcome.\nI would like to take this opportunity to say a massive thank you (m\u0101uruuru in Tahitian) to Hinatea, Moe and everyone who made us feel so welcome, invited us into their homes, shared food and their personal knowledge with such generosity. I truly hope that one day I can return, and in the meantime stay safe.\nThe trip was supported by the Wellcome Trust.

Mellon Foundation, Radcliffe Trust, Normanby Charitable Trust, Dr & Mrs Lucas and the Wellcome Trust.\nYou can find out more about the latest research into the Tahitian mourner\u2019s costume in the video below."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/historical-city-travel-guide-london-late-16th-century/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Historical city travel guide: London, late 16th century", "author": "Barrie Cook, Curator of Medieval and Early Modern Coins", "timestamp": "2020-07-10 00:00:00", "text": "Location\nLondon sits in the fertile south-east of England at an ancient crossing point of the River Thames. For most of its history, ships have been able to navigate up to the city, giving it its status as gateway to the world and fuelling its prosperity.\nLong view of London, from the South Bank, as it appeared before the fire of 1666. From John Speed\u2019s Theatre of the Empire of Great Britain, 1611\u20131612. Engraving, 1610. Note the Rose and Globe theatres on the South Bank and the heads on spikes on London Bridge.\nLondon is currently the largest city in the country by a huge margin, with a population heading towards 200,000 (probably ten times the population of its nearest rivals \u2013 Norwich, Bristol and York), and this dominance has been the case pretty much from the time the kingdom of England itself came into being in the 11th century.\nWhen to visit\nThe climate is temperate and liveable throughout the year, even in the Little Ice Age. However, in the summer anyone who can afford it leaves London, to avoid the heat, the smells (bad at the best of times) and the plague, which is worse when the weather is good, and in the early 1590s there has been a lot of good weather! In summer the Queen goes on \u2018progress\u2019, a tour of one of the regions of the country. The law courts stop sitting, the great lords retreat to their estates and the playing companies go on tour, so there is much less to do.\nGold pomander case with pearls. Recovered from the Thames. 16th century.\nThe best time to visit is probably autumn or spring \u2013 the court and players are back and plague retreats. The smells never really go away, so bring or buy a pomander. Mid-winter is not without its appeal \u2013 if the Thames freezes, there are fairs on the river and the chance to skate (back in 1564 boys staged a football match on the frozen river), and if you have entry to the court, the Christmas festivities are amazing.\nGetting there\nForeign visitors and people from the east and south coast will likely arrive by ship and disembark downriver at Greenwich or come up to the port itself. Most visitors will arrive on foot or horseback via a road system stretching in every direction, many routes still following the path of the ancient Roman roads.\nGold signet engraved with a ship. Early 17th century.\nGetting around\nOnce in the city it\u2019s easiest to walk most of the time, weather permitting, though you may wish to ride a horse (your own or a hired one), or use a carriage (though they are not very comfortable) if you intend to cross the whole city from the eastern suburbs to Westminster. A good rule when walking around, is to keep your eyes up \u2013 while it is illegal to throw refuse into the streets, it happens all the time and you won\u2019t want the contents of a chamber-pot emptied onto your new hat from the overhanging windows!\nView of the Palace of Nonsuch, Surrey, with Queen Elizabeth in a coach surrounded by guards in a procession towards the palace (coloured), illustration to G.

It should be no more than a penny to cross the river, but you should be prepared to pay between twopence and sixpence for a river trip west or east.\nView of Bridgegate, at the entrance to London Bridge, shown with enlarged blindfolded heads impaled on spikes at top.

Many visitors like to stay on the edge of the city in places like the Tabard, handy for visitors from Kent or Surrey (see below), with open fields behind them. The staff there will be happy to give you useful information \u2013 including whether the playhouses are open, if the Queen is at Whitehall, Greenwich, Richmond or Windsor, and if Parliament is sitting.\nBird\u2019s eye view of the City of London from Hampstead to St. Dunstan in the East. Engraving after John Norden, 1600.\nIf you are staying more than three days, the innkeeper will also register you with the city authorities, as is required \u2013 remember to do this yourself if you make other arrangements. Regulation of inns is pretty strict and any complaint will be taken seriously, so you should be reasonably relaxed. Foreign visitors often comment on how clean English inns are. Though if you stay in one of the dodgier areas like Southwark, maybe consider keeping any valuables elsewhere.\nIf you are visiting as an agent of your lord, you will be put up in his London house, perhaps on the Strand by the river. If you are dropping your eldest son off for a term at the Inns of Court to learn to be a gentleman, they will put you up. For those without such connections, you can also get room and board in a private house easily enough (I hear the player Mr Shakespeare boards regularly with a gold-thread maker in Silver St).\nFrom thence towards London bridge on the same side, be many fayre Innes, for receipt of trauellers, by these signes, the Spurre, Christopher, Bull, Queenes head, Tabarde, George, Hart, Kinges Head, &c.

Etching, 1643.\nObvious places to visit are the public areas of the Queen\u2019s palace at Whitehall \u2013 a confusing mass of buildings, extravagantly decorated but with no great vista. You might be able to check out the royal tiltyard, where the lavish Accession Day jousts are celebrated on 17 November in the Queen\u2019s presence. If you are here at this time you should join the crowds of onlookers. Next door is the royal tennis court.\nA silver medal showing the course taken by Francis Drake in his circumnavigation voyage. 1589.\nIf you get inside the palace, a highlight is the great wall map showing Francis Drake\u2019s circumnavigation of the world. It used to be a state secret, but now is up for visitors to see. If you are in town to petition Her Majesty for the grant of an office or redress of a wrong, try to find a place very early on Sunday or a holy day, when she processes in public to the chapel royal and petitions are collected \u2013 it will be packed out. At Westminster Abbey a guide will take you round the great monuments \u2013 visitors sometimes write the epitaphs in notebooks as mementos of their visit.\nGold pendant with a bust of Queen Elizabeth I cut out in silhouette. Around 1570\u20131580.\nA walk from Westminster along the Strand takes you to the City of London proper, passing a succession of great houses abutting the river, including Cecil House and Essex House. To the north side of the Strand are the open fields of Long Acre and Covent Garden.\nWenceslaus Hollar (1607\u20131677), view of Richmond Palace, Surrey, with one of the Thames watermen carrying a party in his wherry on the river. Pen and brown ink, with brown-grey wash, over graphite, 1636\u20131638.\nYou might want to hire one of the watermen and visit Richmond or Greenwich, if the court is in residence there during your visit, or else go to view the Tower of London. The White Tower is believed to have been built by Julius Caesar. You can tour parts of the Tower and a guide will talk you through the cannons, Henry VIII\u2019s armour and show you the royal apartments, the mint, and the Queen\u2019s menagerie, with several lions, a tiger, a porcupine and (if it\u2019s still alive) the last wolf in England. Warning: you have to pay for each of these so the cost can be up to about 3 shillings per person.\nDrawing of the Tower of London. Pen and black ink with grey wash and some later additions in red ink, around 1730.\nEntertainment\nThere is plenty of entertainment in London, mostly in the afternoons. Lack of police, street lighting and transport cuts down on actual night-life outside the royal court. Public theatres are active from October to March, with a new show every few days. Plays start at 2pm and are very affordable, the cheapest tickets, standing in the pit, cost a penny. You might be lucky enough to see Edward Alleyn as Tamberlane or Richard Burbage as Henry V!\nBird\u2019s eye view of Southwark, looking towards the Globe Theatre next to the River Thames. After Wenceslaus Hollar. Etching and engraving, 1810.\nFood and drink can be bought throughout the performances, though beware \u2013 there are no bathrooms or intervals and pickpockets mingle in the crowds. For a more niche audience, there are the boys\u2019 companies where young boys play adult parts. Some viewers find the levels of distance and irony involved engaging and edgy, others think they are lightweight and a bit creepy. Incidentally, if you have your young son with you, keep an eye on him \u2013 the boys\u2019 companies and choirs of the chapel royal and St Paul\u2019s have been known to basically kidnap talented youngsters.\n16th-century ceramic money box, as used at the theatres.\nThe takings were accessed by breaking the box, so the only intact ones that survive were faulty ones.\nThere are often fireworks and street parties on the queen\u2019s accession day anniversary on 17 November. The procession for the new Mayor of London on 29 October has pageants along the way and an elaborate water procession of ornate barges when he goes to take his oath at the Exchequer. Unlike in the country, Mayday is a bit boring, as Londoners are no longer allowed to set up the great maypole at Cornhill.\nElsewhere there are comedy shows, fencing demonstrations, cockfighting, bear and bull-baiting and a host or other activities. As well as the Globe and Rose theatres, Southwark offers five bear-pits \u2013 if you are lucky you might see the famous bear Sackerson, name checked in The Merry Wives of Windsor.\nA drawing of a bear holding a basket on his back with a leaf-shaped shield suspended from his neck. Pen and black ink, early 16th century.\nOn a Sunday, join the crowds at the cross outside St Paul\u2019s Cathedral to hear one of the great preachers, who will often incidentally give you the view from the court on the politics of the day.\nFinally, there is that grisly old favourite, a public execution. There hasn\u2019t been a celebrity execution at the Tower since the Duke of Norfolk in 1572, so it is usually just criminals at Tyburn to see.\nOn September 21st after lunch, about two o\u2019clock, I and my party crossed the water, and there in the house with the thatched roof witnessed an excellent performance of the tragedy of the first Emperor Julius Caesar\u2026 daily at two in the afternoon, London has two, sometimes three plays running in different places, competing with each other, and those which play best enjoy most spectators.\n\n\nThomas Platter, a Swiss visitor to London, in 1599 attends an early performance of Shakespeare\u2019s Julius Caesar at the new Globe Theatre.\nShopping\nIf you want to shop, you might work your way along the goldsmiths\u2019 premises on fashionable Cheapside, or visit one of the clockmakers \u2013 the latest gadgets are little clocks called watches that you can actually carry around. They only keep time to the half-hour, but they will impress your friends!\n\u00c9tienne Delaune (c.1518\u20131583), Goldsmith\u2019s workshop.

A new company has received a charter from the Queen this year (1600) to trade in the East Indies \u2013 I\u2019m not sure they will make much headway against the Spanish.\nOval gilt-brass cased verge watch, 1590.\nThe publishing centre in St Paul\u2019s churchyard is where the printers and booksellers are based. Here you can buy copies of royal proclamations, sermons, poems, plays, school text books and all the classics. While some nicely bound copies will be available, you may prefer to buy them more cheaply unbound, as most people do, so you can get your whole library bound in matching covers to ornament your study. The second part of Edmund Spenser\u2019s Faerie Queen has been available since 1596 and there are several plays by Master Shakespeare for about sixpence each (Richard III, Richard II, Henry IV Part 1, A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, The Merchant of Venice, Much Ado About Nothing and The Merry Wives of Windsor). Now he\u2019s quite famous, they even put his name on the title page!\nFood and drink\nCrispijn de Passe the Elder (1564\u20131637), Gustus (Taste). Engraving with etching, c. 1590\u20131637.\nFood and drink of the familiar seasonal sort is readily available. Breakfast will likely be bread and butter, with perhaps some fresh fruit, if available. You will have lunch, your main meal, at 11.00\u201312.00 and supper, your evening meal, at 17.00\u201318.00. In a decent establishment you will have a choice of roast meats, pies, salad, tarts, fruit and cheese. You will be likely to eat in your inn or with the family you board with, but there is also plenty of street-food to hand \u2013 fruit and nuts, and a range of shellfish bought from the \u2018oyster-wenches\u2019 who work the streets \u2013 fresh, pre-packed food, though the shells are a nuisance underfoot, especially in bad weather, hidden in the mud. For the sweet-toothed there is marchpane (marzipan), sugar-candy and gingerbread to nibble on \u2013 a pennyworth will keep the kids quiet for a good while.\nGlass goblet attributed to Jacopo Verzelini (1571\u20131592 active in England). Factory in Broad Street, London, 1586.\nTo drink there is bottle beer and ale (never trust the water), strong for the men and weak \u2018small beer\u2019 for ladies, children and the clergy. There is plenty of wine available, white wine from France and the Rhineland, red wine from France, Spain, Italy and Greece, and fortified sweet wines, including Malmsey from Crete and Muscatel from France.\nA London habit is to end a day of festivities with a glass of hippocras, wine mixed with cinnamon, ginger and sugar. Inns have their wine barrels out in public, by official regulation, so customers can see they get what they order. If you are lucky enough to be invited to a feast at court, the Inns of Court, or a city company, the thing to do is pace yourself \u2013 courses are endless in number, with multiple options on offer for each of the courses. You might encounter a fancy new thing bought from Italy, a metal tool with two prongs they call a \u2018fork\u2019. I doubt it will catch on \u2013 there\u2019s nothing wrong with fingers.\nWedding knife and fork; gold enamelled handles, Dutch, c. 1600.\nIn number of dishes and change of meat the nobility of England (whose cooks are for the most part musical-headed Frenchmen and strangers) do most exceed, sith there is no day in manner that passeth over their heads wherein they have not only beef, mutton, veal, lamb, kid, pork, cony, capon, pig, or so many of these as the season yieldeth, but also some portion of the red or fallow deer, beside great variety of fish and wild fowl and thereto sundry other delicates wherein the sweet hand of the Portugal is not wanting: so for a man to dine with one of them, and to taste every dish that standeth before him\u2026is rather to yield unto a conspiracy with a great deal of meat for the speedy suppression of natural health.\n\nFrom William Harrison, A description of England, 1577\nLocal customs\nVisitors shouldn\u2019t have too many problems, London is an international city, so once you have established your temporary residency, London behaviour is on par with English and European norms overall. There is the usual level of petty violence inevitable when everyone carries at least a dagger and law enforcement is left to amateurs from the local communities serving short terms as constables and beadles. The authorities have tried to crack down on violent brawling by regulating sword length \u2013 check your rapier before you arrive, it will be broken at the city gate if it is more than a yard (0.91 metres) long.\nQuillon dagger with a straight, double-edged, hollow ground blade. Iron and brass, 1593.\nForeign visitors are sometimes taken aback by the boisterousness and drunkenness of London, and rather shocked by the fairly free and easy behaviour of English women, especially in dress. In Europe, Spanish fashions tend to dominate, with women covered from the chin down, so when a foreign visitor sees an unmarried English lady, even the Queen herself, with her neck and a bit of cleavage visible, they can get rather flustered.\nOne thing you won\u2019t be used to, visiting from the country, is timekeeping: there are clocks and chiming bells everywhere in the city, regulating curfews, church services, theatre performances and the rest.\nClock made by Nicolas Vallin (c. 1565\u20131603 active). Steel, gold and brass, 1598.\nYou will all be good Protestants, of course, attending your local parish church in London as you would at home \u2013 everyone will know if you don\u2019t and news will get to the authorities in this self-policing society. England is still at war with Spain and the Pope so the authorities are on the alert for Jesuit missionaries and Spanish agents! Don\u2019t go near the lodgings of the ambassador of a Catholic prince on Sunday \u2013 it will be assumed you are going to hear mass. If you want a change, maybe attend a service at one of the Stranger Churches, where migrants worship, for example the Dutch at the old Austin Friars on Broad Street. If there is an event of national importance to justify a special service led by the Queen, try to get entry to St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. The cathedral itself has never recovered from being struck by lightning in 1561. It needs a lot of work but will probably have to burn down before that happens!\nTitle page to the \u2018Bishop\u2019s Bible\u2019. A copy of this bible had to be placed in every church.

What a pity it isn\u2019t illegal.\u2019 Whether that\u2019s a reliable citation (debatable) or just wishful thinking, it\u2019s still my favourite ice cream quote and reflects our historic obsession with this frozen treat. After all, there won\u2019t be many of us who didn\u2019t have an experience of ice cream eating as a child, scrabbling to finish it off before the whole thing melted down your arm. Or perhaps it\u2019s in our older years, when we have craved that taste of nostalgia and some cool relief during a hot summer\u2019s day. So, with summer fast approaching, I wanted to reflect on the ancient techniques of this icy dessert, delving into the Museum\u2019s collection (and my own) to give you a little taste of history.\nLantern slide, showing an ancient ice house inside a defensive wall. Iran. Photographed by Gen Sir Percy Molesworth Sykes KCIE. Around 1900.\nBefore we can talk about ice cream, we must talk about ice, because in the era before freezers you needed to know how to collect and store ice before you could even think of making a frozen dessert. The technology for keeping ice originated in the Middle East and was developed in ancient Mesopotamia as far back as 2000 BC. There\u2019s a fantastic image of an ancient Iranian ice-house in the British Museum collection, which shows the predominantly subterranean building that enabled the ancients to keep water frozen throughout the sweltering seasons. Beyond the thick walls and tiny entrance of the building was a funnel-shaped room, dug far down below ground level. This stabilised the temperature within, like a thermos flask, while allowing for melted ice to drain away and new ice to be added every year. The ice would have been collected from the high up in the mountains or frozen lakes in winter \u2013 which is why Europeans would later refer to this sort of building as a \u2018snow-pit\u2019. However, there wouldn\u2019t be any mention of actual ice cream in Europe until the 17th century, thousands of years later.\nAbraham Blooteling (1640\u20131690), Portrait of King Charles II after Sir Peter Lely (1618\u20131680). Brush drawing in grey wash, 1655\u20131690.\nThe first printed ice cream recipe in Europe was in the handwritten receipts of Lady Anne Fanshawe (1625\u20131680) in 1665 \u2013 whose husband Sir Richard was Charles II\u2019s ambassador to Spain. Her recipe titled \u2018To make Icy Cream\u2019 suggests the addition of ambergris or orange-flower water, which were both fashionable ingredients at the time. However the recipe would never have worked, as she forgot to mention that you needed to add salt to the ice around the ice cream mixture. The technique of adding salt, or saltpeter, to the ice surrounding the ice cream base, was an early modern development that allowed mixtures to be frozen solid. The salt creates an endothermic reaction that lowers the freezing temperature of water, therefore making it colder. Prior to this discovery, mankind\u2019s experience of ices was in the form of semi-frozen drinks, such as the Persian sherbat or sherbet, which was made by whisking ice shavings or snow into sugar syrup and citrus juice. As such, the early flavours for ice cream in the West had an Eastern influence, with rosewater, orange-flower blossom and fragrant citrus flavours dominating.\nGaetano Dura (1805\u20131878), Sorbettaro ambulante (Mobile sorbet-maker). Hand-coloured lithograph, around 1850.\nLeft: 1870s Sorbetiere. Photo: Tasha Marks. Right: Sorbetiere in action at the home of Ivan Day. Photo: Tasha Marks.\nBut how were they actually making ice cream before freezers? The primary piece of equipment was a sorbetiere, which can be seen in the images above. This pewter vessel was nestled into a mixture of ice and salt, with the ice cream mix then poured into the interior. This was then agitated using the handle, or a flat spoon, known as a spaddle. This technology was surprisingly effective, freezing the mixture in a shorter amount of time than most contemporary ice cream machines. The machinery relied on a supply of ice, but was otherwise simple and portable.\nLes glaces from Le Bon Genre. Hand-coloured etching, 1801.\nThe 18th century was arguably the heyday for ice cream, with more varieties on offer in Georgian London than could be found in most establishments today. Flavours such as chocolate, pistachio, pineapple, jasmine, artichoke, candied pumpkin, pine nut, pear and chestnut appeared in many of London\u2019s fashionable ice cream parlours.\n18th-century ice cream flavours (brown bread, apricot & orange flower blossom, and chocolate water ice). Photo Tasha Marks.\nAs well as these fabulous flavours the Georgian era promoted the shaping of ices into a myriad of forms. The ice cream cone hadn\u2019t quite been invented yet, so making moulded ice cream was the most fashionable way to serve your dessert. The moulds, made from pewter, were available in all sorts of shapes; from lobsters and joints of ham, to pineapples and roses \u2013 all waiting to be cast in your frozen dessert. To make an ice cream using one of these hinged moulds, they would first be filled with partially frozen ice cream (made using a sorbetiere), then closed, sealed with a wax mixture and plunged into a tub of ice and salt for three hours. The frosty forms were then painted with their natural colour, decorated with real stalks and foliage \u2013 or in the case of a certain candle-shaped ice cream mould that I have in my collection, adorned with a working wick for an illusionistic centerpiece.\nPewter ice cream mould, shaped like a candle. Photo Tasha Marks\nIce cream candle, with working wick. Photo Tasha Marks.\nAs well as these amazing icy banquets for the super wealthy, the 18th century also saw the appearance of several notable ice cream parlours, aimed at both nobility and the growing middle classes. If I could go back in time I know which one would be top of my list\u2026 The Pineapple in Berkeley Square, London. This infamous ice cream shop was run by Italian confectioner Domenico Negri (1760\u20131800 fl.) and boasted an incredible list of flavours and forms. Established favourites like Royal Ice Cream (with lemon, orange-flower water, orange and pistachio) sat beside more experimental flavours, like Parmesan Ice Cream and Cucumber Ice (with ginger brandy and lemon).\nIgnatius Fougeron (c.1750/68\u2013 fl.) after Peter Babel (1752\u20131763 fl.), Trade card of Domenico Negri (1760\u20131800 fl.), confectioner at The Pineapple, Berkeley Square, London. Etching and engraving, 1760\u20131767.\nWhile sadly Negri didn\u2019t publish any of his recipes, many appeared in the book The Complete Confectioner by Frederick Nutt (1906). Nutt was Negri\u2019s apprentice and author of one of the most important ice cream recipe books of the century. Not only did the publication have detailed instructions of how to make the desserts, it also had measurements, which are crucial in ice cream making \u2013 too much sugar and it won\u2019t freeze properly, while too little creates a rough texture. Finally the full secrets of ice cream had been revealed, and that meant more of it for everyone.\nJohn James Chalon (1778\u20131854), La Caf\u00e9 from Twenty-four subjects exhibiting the Costume of Paris. Hand-coloured lithograph, 1820.\nHowever, the popularity of sweet treats like ice cream had devastating consequences that were unseen by the average visitor to the ice cream salon. The production of the dessert went hand in hand with the import of sugar throughout the 18th century. Ice cream had become available to more echelons of society partially due to the decrease in the price of sugar, which was a direct result of the transatlantic slave trade. This disturbing episode of history saw enslaved people treated as objects, and commodities treated as kings. Primarily sugar, but also tobacco, coffee, cotton and rum. This undercurrent of ice cream history is something that is uncomfortable to incorporate into the narrative, but for every grand banquet full of sculptural ices and for each ice cream shop offering icy treats, there was a very different diorama happening in the bows of ships and the cane fields of the Caribbean.\nPlan and cross-section of the slave ship \u2018Brookes\u2019 of Liverpool. Woodcut print, 1789.\nLike most food history, ice cream reveals more about society than you might expect. Food is political, it\u2019s anthropological, and revealing in ways that both entice us in and make us uncomfortable. Ice cream is an iconic foodstuff with worldwide appeal; it crosses borders and class boundaries in unique ways. So with that in mind I wanted to conclude with two very different visions of the ice cream experience \u2013 both produced in the 19th century and both used to serve ice cream. The first is this entrancing Napoleonic ice cream pail from 1811, belonging to Bonaparte himself.\nPorcelain ice-pail, one of a pair. S\u00e8vres Factory, France, 1811.\nWhen exploring the British Museum collection for ice cream paraphernalia, this piece\u2019s gilded fa\u00e7ade and exceptional design drew me in. The design survives at the S\u00e8vres factory and shows the position of the metal liner, now missing, which held the ice cream surrounded by crushed ice. As an opulent method to serve ice cream, it\u2019s excessively ornate and fantastical.\nPenny lick. Photo Tasha Marks.\nOn the other hand, I wanted to show you a penny lick \u2013 an object from my own collection, which was used to serve ice cream in the street throughout the Victorian era. You paid \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 a penny, and the glass would be \u2018filled\u2019 with ice cream. However as you can see the glass itself is an illusion, with only a slight indentation to be topped up. These glasses were then licked clean and passed back to the vendor, to be lightly rinsed for the next patron.\nPhilibert Louis Debucourt (1755\u20131832), Gouter des Anglais. Hand-coloured aquatint with stipple engraving, 1815.\nTwo very different experiences of ice cream eating that could easily have been happening in parallel. But I\u2019ve put these two side by side because for me, the joy of ice cream is in the eating. Do I think that Emperor Napoleon enjoyed his first taste of ice cream any more or less than the Victorian child paying a penny in the street? Absolutely not! Ice cream is a great leveler, a lick of escapism that we can all enjoy \u2013 and on that note, I\u2019m off to get myself one!\n18th-century brown bread and marmalade ice cream.

The PAS scheme, which was launched in 1997, records archaeological finds discovered in England and Wales by members of the public. Since then, colleagues from the British Museum and Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales \u2013 have managed the programme, working with 40 regional Finds Liaison Officers (FLOs) to identify and record the finds, from arrowheads and axes to brooches and buckles.\nSome of the c. 52,000 coins from the Frome Hoard, found in Frome, Somerset, AD 253\u2013293.\nThe discoveries have shaped our understanding of the archaeology of Britain, and represent human existence on the British Isles from the Palaeolithic, with 700,000-year-old worked flints, through to 20th-century militia badges. They range in size from vast coin hoards \u2013 the largest being the Frome Hoard with 52,000 coins \u2013 to one-off finds like the Ringlemere Cup, which you can read about below.\nTo celebrate the milestone of 1.5 million finds, we\u2019ve compiled a top ten list of discoveries which have most transformed our knowledge of the past.\n1. The Ringlemere Cup\nThe Ringlemere Cup, found in Kent, 1700\u20131500 BC.\nWe\u2019re starting the list with a trip back to Bronze Age Kent, and shining a light on the dazzling Ringlemere Cup which was discovered on 4 November 2001. This golden vessel was made between 1700\u20131500 BC, and was found by metal-detectorist Cliff Bradshaw in the fields of Ringlemere Farm in the south of England.\nThe cup is one of the oldest treasures ever discovered in Britain, and is incredibly important due to its age and rarity \u2013 only one other gold Bronze Age cup has been found in England. Although the vessel is now crumpled, probably as a result of a farmer\u2019s plough, it has a rounded base which suggests it would have been held and passed around, perhaps like a modern communion cup.\n2. Roman \u2018grots\u2019\nExamples of Roman \u2018grots\u2019.\nAlthough individually they might not seem special, these Roman \u2018grots\u2019 \u2013 a term sometimes used to describe worn and corroded coins from this period \u2013 can be incredibly useful in telling us about where people lived, worked and travelled in Roman Britain.\nEach emperor (and most usurpers) issued their own coinage, meaning we can trace the growth of Roman Britain from the invasion in AD 43 through to the collapse of the province by AD 409/410. Over 320,000 Roman coins have now been recorded on the PAS database, found all over England and Wales. They tell us that the rural landscape may have been more important to the Roman economy than we have previously imagined, acting as an important source of food for the Roman army.\n3. Domitianus \u2013 the doubtful emperor\nThe rare coin of Domitianus from the Chalgrove hoard, Oxford, c. AD 271.\nPhoto: Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.\nWhen a coin minted by the Roman emperor Domitianus was found in a French hoard in 1900, it was rejected as a hoax \u2013 nobody had ever head of a \u2018Domitianus\u2019 and there was no supporting evidence for his existence.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2003, when metal-detectorist Brian Malin found a jar containing 4,957 Roman coins including one bearing the portrait of the same Domitianus, that opinion began to change. Because of this discovery, we now know that Domitianus is likely to have been a very short-lived emperor in Gaul \u2013 he may have only ruled for a few days or weeks, but he made sure to mint a few coins in that time.\n4. A souvenir from Hadrian\u2019s wall\nThe Staffordshire Moorlands Pan, found in Staffordshire, mid 2nd century AD.\nBeautifully decorated with colourful enamel circles, the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan is one of a group that were crafted to celebrate Hadrian\u2019s Wall, usually as keepsakes for the soldiers who spent their time on this edge of the empire.\nInscribed around the rim are the names of the four forts on the western end of the Wall \u2013 a sequence which would have brought to mind endless marches along this route between the garrisons for the soldiers stationed there. One of them may have been Draco \u2013 the likely owner of this pan, whose name is inscribed on it.\n5. The Staffordshire Hoard\nA sample of objects from the Staffordshire Hoard, found in Staffordshire, AD 650\u2013675. Photo courtesy of Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.\nAnother transformative discovery to have come through the PAS is the Staffordshire Hoard, which shone new light on the early Anglo Saxon period.\nIn 2009, over four and a half thousand fragments of war gear and religious objects from the 7th century were discovered near the village of Hammerwich in the English Midlands, amounting to 4kg of gold and 1.5kg of silver. Both the size of the hoard and the exquisite craftmanship of some of the objects garnered significant public attention, turning the world\u2019s gaze on the early Anglo Saxon period and raising new questions about the people who made and used these beautiful items.\nYou can see objects from the dazzling hoard at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and the Potteries Museum.\n6. Alfred the Great\nSome of the coins of Alfred and Ceolwulf II in the Watlington Hoard, found in Oxfordshire, c. AD 878.\nThe late 9th century in Britain was a time of turmoil, as Viking forces swept through the kingdoms of Northumbria, East Anglia, and Mercia, before turning their attention on Wessex \u2013 the home of Alfred the Great.\nThe Watlington Hoard, containing Viking silver jewellery, ingots and coins, illuminates the political situation right after AD 878, when Alfred defeated the Vikings at the battle of Edington. In the hoard were rare silver pennies of Alfred the Great and the king of Mercia, Ceolwulf II, which were produced using the same design, suggesting economic co-operation between the two kingdoms in a time of great uncertainty.\nThe Watlington Hoard is on display at the Ashmolean Museum.\n7. The Chew Valley Hoard\nTwo coins from the Chew Valley Hoard, showing Harold II (right) and William the Conqueror (left), found in Somerset, c. 1067\u20131068.\n1066 \u2013 the year of the Norman Conquest \u2013 was the start of a period of huge instability in English history, as the country transitioned from Anglo Saxon to Norman rule.\nThe Chew Valley Hoard, found in 2019, was buried in the west of England during the early years of William the Conqueror\u2019s rule, and its contents are divided between coins minted under Harold II \u2013 the last crowned Anglo Saxon king, and the first issue of coinage under William. The hoard has doubled the number of coins available to study for Harold, and increased by five times those for William, opening up new windows of discovery for the late 1060s.\n8. From the Anglo Saxons to Afghanistan\nThe Vale of York Hoard, found in Yorkshire, 9th century AD.\nThe Vale of York Hoard is an astonishing record of Viking wealth, craftsmanship, and trade links \u2013 and it all fits into one little silver-gilt cup.\nThe hoard was found by father and son David and Andrew Whelan in 2007, and contains a remarkable range of objects. Deposited around AD 927, the cup itself is probably from a church in Carolingian France, and much of the jewellery within is Irish. Remarkably, the coins extend in origin from Anglo Saxon England to Afghanistan.\nYou\u2019ll find objects from the Vale of York Hoard at Yorkshire Museum.\n9. Pilgrim badges for Thomas Becket\nA pilgrim badge of Saint Thomas Becket, found in the River Thames, 14th\u201315th century.\nAlthough pilgrim badges are not especially rare, this particular example, found on the banks of the River Thames in 2016, is surprisingly pristine considering it lay in the river mud for perhaps 700 years.\nMade in the 14th or 15th century, it shows the assassination of Saint Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral and the hand of god descending on Becket at the moment of his martyrdom. Pilgrim badges like this one were hugely popular throughout the Middle Ages \u2013 they were used as proof of a pilgrimage, and many believed they turned into a lucky charm when they had touched a relic.\n10. Richard III\u2019s Bosworth boar\nBoar badge from the Battle of Bosworth, found in Leicestershire, 1480s.\nWe know that King Richard III used the symbol of the boar as his emblem throughout his life \u2013 badges were made for his coronation and for the investiture of his son as the Prince of Wales, but this particular pig tells us more about his death.\nMade of silver-gilt, this broken badge was found at the site of the Battle of Bosworth where Richard famously lost his life in the Wars of the Roses. It is likely to have been lost by a member of the king\u2019s personal household, and its remarkable discovery has moved the epicentre of the battle about 3 kilometres from where it was previously thought.\nAll of these discoveries have been made by members of the public, who have recorded their finds through the PAS with the help of a network of 40 Finds Liaison Officers (FLOs) who work as a team directed by the Museum, and are based locally at 100 national and local partners. We\u2019d like to say thank you to everyone who has voluntarily come forward to record their discoveries so we can all learn more about our shared past. The PAS team are looking forward to even more finds being recorded \u2013 who knows what exciting discoveries are yet to be made!\nIf any of these discoveries have piqued your interest, all the information recorded on the PAS database is freely available to anyone, and is used by students, scholars, researchers and the public alike \u2013 you can start exploring here.\nIf you\u2019re lucky enough to find something of archaeological interest buried in your garden, record any finds through your local Finds Liaison officer \u2013 the stories above show you never know what you might discover when doing some digging."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/museums-from-home-across-the-uk/", "category": "News", "title": "Museums from home across the UK", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2020-06-26 00:00:00", "text": "The British Museum works in partnership with more than 250 cultural organisations based all over the UK as part of its National Programmes scheme. We collaborate with partners to share collections through touring exhibitions and loans. Because of this, more than 10.5 million people had the chance to see objects from our collection outside of London. National Programmes also share training and skills development for sector professionals through our Knowledge Share Programme, for the public through the Portable Antiquities Scheme, and for young people through our Youth Collective and our paid traineeships.\nThe Museum Futures programme will provide year-long paid training placements for 27 young people (primarily 18\u201324 year olds) at over 21 partner organisations and at the British Museum. Through on-the-job training in digital skills related to museum collections, we aim to equip trainees with the necessary knowledge and experience to pursue a career in museums, or in the wider cultural sector. Trainees are recruited locally by each host partner, and digital projects vary from photography and 3D scanning of objects to online engagement through social media to data management and preservation. All roles are aimed at new entrants to the sector, and we encourage applicants without undergraduate degrees and with little or no museum experience to apply.\nThe image above shows the nine current Museum Futures trainees at the start of their placements in January 2020. Of course, no one expected that by the end of March, they would all be forced to work from home because of a global pandemic.\nIn this post, each trainee has shared some insights into the work that they and their museums have been doing to engage audiences and preserve collections online while museums are physically closed.\nRoisin Daly, Trainee at Bristol Culture and South West Museum Development\nAt Bristol Culture and South West Museum Development, we have a multidisciplinary collection across five venues including the Bristol Museum & Art Gallery and M Shed, with around 1.75 million objects and over a million visitors per year. Bristol Culture has worked in partnership with the British Museum through the Portable Antiquities Scheme, was the lead partner for the hugely popular joint touring exhibition Roman Empire, and have hosted numerous other British Museum touring exhibitions.\nDuring the closure period we have had to re-assess our digital engagement strategy to cater to our online audience, inviting our digital visitors to delve into Bristol\u2019s stories, go behind the scenes with our blog and explore our collections and exhibitions from home.\nPart of my work has been creating reports from the Collections Management System to be used for various projects, including the online publication of the British Empire and Commonwealth Collection and Archives Online. Another part of my role in the digital team is to promote digital engagement.\nCredit: Bristol Museum & Art Gallery\nDuring lockdown Bristol Culture has been responding to emerging events in Bristol\u2019s social history, including COVID-19 lockdown and the Black Lives Matter demonstrations, through being active on social media and by sharing stories relating to museum collections. I have been coordinating the content contributed by Bristol\u2019s communities, to develop an interactive timeline to display important events in Bristol\u2019s history using open source technology.\nTo delve into Bristol\u2019s stories please visit our website.\nAlexis Milinkovic, Trainee at Birmingham Museums Trust\nThe main site I work from is the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery \u2013 officially founded in 1885, with origins going back to 1829. BMT (Birmingham Museums Trust) is the largest independent museums charitable trust in the United Kingdom, comprising of nine museums and historic sites. BMT and the British Museum have long worked together, and one example being the Faith in Birmingham gallery, which was developed in partnership.\nDante Gabriele Rossetti (1828\u20131882), Dante\u2019s Dream at the Time of the Death of Beatrice \u2013 Study of Dante holding the Hand of Love. Pencil on paper, 1855\u20131856. Birmingham Museums Trust 1904P344, CC0 Public Domain.\nBMT has continued sharing content to entertain and educate people stuck indoors. The digital team has made the most of social media to share stories and images from the Digital Asset Management website. Before lockdown, my main project was to digitise our collection of Pre-Raphaelite artworks, including private sketchbooks of Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and I felt incredibly privileged to share access to this collection. DAM\u2019s website enables access to high-quality, out of copyright images, free of charge. Given that people can\u2019t currently visit the museums, it is a great way to share and experience the collection.\nAnother project I am involved in is artist research alongside volunteers. Working with volunteers from different backgrounds and ages is a joy and reminds me why museums are such important places.\nBMT has acknowledged that this pandemic is a matter of extreme importance, on a local and global level. The community shop at Sarehole Mill has remained open throughout, converting from gift shop to food shop. This was so helpful, especially at the start of the lockdown period when panic buying led to shortages in many large supermarkets.\nWe have also launched the project Life on Lockdown in order to capture, share and preserve just how our communities dealt with and came together in this unique moment of history.\nPlease check out the album of photos and videos submitted by the public on Flickr.\nCredit: Birmingham Museums Trust.\nYou can also experience Birmimgham Museum and Art Gallery at home on a virtual tour.\nCaroline Ingram, Trainee at Irish Linen Centre and Lisburn Museum\nSituated in the heart of Lisburn, Northern Ireland, Irish Linen Centre and Lisburn Museum is surrounded by a rich industrial heritage founded on the linen trade. The museum works with the community to celebrate local heritage, make personal connections, and create immersive experiences. Visitors can try their hand at weaving and spinning linen, and chat to our expert weavers and see them operate traditional Jacquard looms.\nCredit: Irish Linen Centre and Lisburn Museum\nAfter closing to the public, the team immediately went into action, launching the Virtual Museum to offer online resources, exhibitions, and activities for all ages. I have produced lots of content for the Virtual Museum, including an online tutorial for Augmented Reality, showing how to use a smartphone to bring 3D models from the Museum\u2019s collections into your own home.\nThe museum has also launched a contemporary collecting project, COVID-19 and Me, asking the public to share their stories on how they are adapting to \u2018life under lockdown\u2019. The response to this has been great and we hope it has brought the community closer to the museum during this time. Our curators have been collecting items in response, including face masks, art, newspapers, NHS badges, photographs and personal accounts, all of these everyday items that now tell an important story that can be shared in later years.\nThe museum is continuing to develop future exhibitions such as Centenary of the Swanzy Riots (due to open in August 2020). The current circumstance requires the museum to look at new ways to present content to ensure it is showcased appropriately and displays multiple perspectives.\nThis experience has been rather surreal, and I look forward to seeing the \u2018new normal\u2019 that the museum re-opening brings. However, I am very grateful of the support received through National Programmes, Museum Futures Team and all the Staff at The Irish Linen Centre and Lisburn Museum.\nBe sure to keep up to date with the latest Virtual Museum content at our Facebook page.\nJaz Curzon, Derby Museums\nDerby Museums has three sites in Derbyshire (the Museum & Art Gallery, Pickford\u2019s House and the Silk Mill). Highlights of our collections include the Joseph Wright of Derby art collection and the Collections of Making which tell the story of Derby\u2019s manufacturing history and those who were involved in these industries. This collection will form the basis of the redeveloped Silk Mill as it becomes Derby\u2019s Museum of Making. Derby Museum has hosted several British Museum touring exhibitions including Music of Courtly India in 2017, and we are part of the upcoming spotlight tour of the British Museum\u2019s Lampedusa Cross.\nDerby Museums is for the thinker and maker in all of us. Together we make museums for the head, heart and hands. We do this by being independent, fostering a spirit of experimentation, pursuing mutual relationships, creating the conditions for wellbeing (helping people connect with others, keep learning, take notice of the world and give back to the community) and proving that we are doing it.\nSince lockdown, we have created a Derby Museums From Home site to allow online audiences to explore and discover our collections. I was also involved in the development and installation of the Florence Nightingale exhibition, which now has an online presence. Derby Museums wouldn\u2019t be the same without the incredible volunteers, and their contribution has continued during lockdown with the Interlace Project which will form a woven art installation.\nWhen the museum was open, I did a lot of hands-on work such as helping set up exhibitions, making 3D scans, and illustrating objects. That has changed drastically as now all my work is done on a laptop at home. The positive side of this is it has given me a chance to dive into the digital world of museums, learning how items are catalogued, and exploring the vast variety of objects in our collections that I wouldn\u2019t have seen before.\nPlease visit our microsite to learn more about the \u00a317m programme to create an inspirational and active Museum of Making.\nKyle Muir, Trainee at Tullie House Museum & Art Gallery\nTullie House is located in Carlisle, Cumbria and was established in 1893 with major redevelopment and expansion in 2001. Our collections tell the story of the people who lived, loved, worked and died here, from Roman soldiers patrolling Hadrian\u2019s wall, to the Border Reivers and Jacobite rebels, to modern day farmers and factory workers.\nTullie House is home to the Roman Frontiers Gallery, a British Museum Partnership Gallery, which opened in 2011. My supervisor and Curatorial Manager Dr Gabrielle Heffernan started her career as a British Museum trainee.\nCredit: Tullie House Museum & Art Gallery\nDuring the COVID-19 closure, Tullie House has been asking our audiences to send in photos that will help tell the story of Cumbria during the current pandemic. In particular, we have been collecting signs and symbols of support, such as NHS rainbows, teddies in people\u2019s windows (for children out on walks), signs on local buildings and other photos of Carlisle life and nature in lockdown. I have contributed by sending photos of what my village has been doing to support the NHS and to keep morale up.\nWe have also added some of our art collection and photographs to our website and turned them into 35-piece to 130-piece digital jigsaws.\nLindsey Atkinson, our Community and Young People Co-ordinator, has been continuing to work with young people on the Hope Streets project, which is a partnership with Curious Minds and supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund. They are researching local stories and finding imaginative ways to engage more young people with their heritage.\nYou can hear these stories, which will be showcased with a digital Festival of Hope in July\nAnd if you live in Cumbria, please submit photos to the COVID-19 Collection.\nRowan Law, Hastings Museum & Art Gallery\nHastings Museum and Art Gallery is a local authority Museum under Hastings Borough Council with collections from prehistory to the present day and from every continent. Established in 1892, the museum moved to its current residence in 1927.\nCredit: Hastings Museum & Art Gallery\nCredit: Hastings Museum and Art Gallery\nOur goal as a museum is to be a hub for the community and a museum for everyone in Hastings. We aim for engagement with local people and to provide representation for all people within our town. One of our latest projects that best exemplifies this is Hastings Digital Quilt. Based on a painting by Edward Badham (1872\u20131944) of the town, members of the local community submitted individual patches to make up a patchwork collage recreating the artwork.\nWe are closed to the public but open online through #HastingsDigitalMuseum. Our content roadmap has evolved as we\u2019ve managed to look at what works and what doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ve tried everything from quizzes and craft competitions to live-streams of Lego dinosaurs. Overall, I\u2019d say that we\u2019ve received very positive feedback from our online presence, and it has been heart-warming to read and respond to all the comments we\u2019ve received.\nTo take part in daily activities aimed at families or the young at heart (ex. Mythical Island Monday and Lego Challenge Live Tuesday) please visit our Facebook page.\nMohammed Miah, The British Museum\nI am part of the Samsung Digital Discovery Centre at the British Museum. We run digital workshops and activities to entertain, educate and offer new avenues of learning at the Museum. Our weekday audiences are typically school groups, either in-person or \u2018virtual visits\u2019 from classrooms, and on weekends we cater to families. One of my favourite workshops teaches kids how to use Minecraft to build Roman Britain. Another uses the Samsung Centre\u2019s green screen and photo manipulation apps to create images placing visitors in various settings with British Museum objects, usually to hilarious effect.\nThe lockdown has made it impossible to continue teaching digital workshops while not physically being inside the Museum space. And the logistics behind continuing to offer our activities remotely were not immediately feasible.\nHowever, we have created an engaging activity that children can enjoy at home, using things that are easily accessible. We want to encourage children to build structures, inspired by representations of different types of architecture in the British Museum collection \u2013 from towers to stadiums, and from palaces to homes. You can create your buildings using digital programmes like Minecraft, building materials like lego, or simply with a pen and paper.\nGet inspired with these resources here.\nRebecca Clayton, Trainee at Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums\nTyne & Wear Archives & Museums (TWAM) is a regional museum, art gallery and archives service. Over 1.1 million objects are held across nine venues, hosting a vast variety of collections relating to art, science and technology, social history, fashion, natural sciences, archaeology, and so on.\nTWAM has long been a valuable part of the National Programmes. The Great North Museum\u2019s Ancient Egypt Gallery, which opened in 2009, is a partnership with the British Museum. TWAM were the lead partner for the popular touring exhibition Pharaoh: King of Egypt in 2011 and have hosted numerous other BM touring exhibitions. The Great North Museum is currently hosting the touring exhibition Ancient Iraq: new discoveries which opened in March 2020.\nIn lieu of being able to physically experience our museums and galleries, the public have been enjoying virtual tours of our stores and exhibition spaces. The tours of Great North Museum\u2019s Biology and Ethnographic stores, along with the museum\u2019s Ice Age to Iron Age Gallery have seen a 440% monthly increase in visitors. Digital content has also played a significant role \u2013 our Must-See Museums membership scheme now sends free monthly tailored e-newsletters to bring stories and suggestions to our audiences based on their interests.\nOur upcoming digital editorial platform, Must-See Stories, is dedicated to telling compelling stories inspired by our collections. One example is Heavier! Faster! Louder! The Story of Tyneside Heavy Metal, which is a six-part audio documentary narrated by renowned hard rock DJ Alan Robson.\nDespite the challenging time recently, this period has been a great opportunity to learn and engage with pre-existing content. I personally have been enjoying listening to The Wonder House hosted by British Museum curator Sushma Jansari, a podcast series that holds interview discussions focusing on contemporary approaches to decolonising museums. It is an eye-opening series that raises awareness about the work of museum practitioners who are challenging dominant narratives and systemic racism within the cultural heritage industry. This is an area of work I hope to contribute to more beyond the traineeship.\nThe Museum Futures programme is supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund. We are currently recruiting museum partners to host trainees for the 2021 cohort. Once partners are confirmed we will add more information about placements and how to apply here."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/eight-lgbtq-objects-to-celebrate-pride-2020/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "Eight LGBTQ objects to celebrate Pride 2020", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2020-06-26 00:00:00", "text": "To celebrate Pride month our LGBTQ tour volunteers \u2013 and others who have helped our volunteers to research these histories in the collection \u2013 have selected objects with an LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer) connection from the Museum\u2019s collection to share with you.\nDuring 2018 and 2019 the British Museum partnership exhibition Desire, Love, Identity: exploring LGBTQ histories visited five venues across the UK. Each added objects from their own collections and communities to the show, highlighting local LGBTQ histories and connections. Colleagues from Norwich Millennium Library and Bolton Museum have also shared some of their favourite objects from their version of the exhibition below.\nFigures of Castor and Pollux \u2013 Chris Weston, LGBTQ Tour Volunteer, British Museum\nGroup of Castor and Pollux made in the Meissen Porcelain Factory. Unglazed porcelain, moulded, 1788\u20131789.\nI am fascinated by this little 1780s Meissen porcelain group, which, beneath its unimpeachable credentials as fine art copied from a classical original, seethes with queerness. The Prado Museum in Madrid calls the life-sized original that inspired this work Orestes and Pylades after an 18th-century interpretation of the work as two mythical Greek princes. The 2nd-century poet Lucian (c. AD 125\u2013180) viewed them as ideal lovers, who \u2018taking a god as witness of the passion between them, sailed through life together as though in one boat\u2019. 18th-century composers George Frederick H\u00e4ndel (1685\u20131759) and Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714\u20131787) popularised the story with audiences through sympathetic operas.\nIt\u2019s easy to suppose this homoerotic interpretation of such a sensuous object appealed to gay 18th-century collectors. Sadly, modern scholarship identifies the young men not as lovers, but as the twins Castor and Pollux, but the original sculpture has further LGBTQ connections. The left-hand figure\u2019s head is a restoration using a portrait of the Roman emperor Hadrian\u2019s lover Antinous, whose death in AD 130 so grieved his partner that he had him declared a god (read more here). Moreover, the sculptural group featured in the collection of the brilliant Queen Christina of Sweden (1626\u20131689), whose flouting of 17th-century convention included adoption of masculine dress and manners, not to mention passionate attachments to other women.\nDish depicting Queen Anne \u2013 Jack Shoulder, Museum Education Specialist and LGBTQ Historian\nGlazed earthenware dish made by Norfolk House Pottery, 1702\u20131715.\nQueen Anne (1665\u20131714), seen on this delftware plate, is perhaps not as well-remembered as other Queens of England or Great Britain. Or rather, she was barely remembered until in 2018, The Favourite, starring Olivia Coleman, was released and we encountered a new side to Anne and her court.\nWe saw the queen navigating perilous political situations and take council from savvy women in her court such as her close companions, the powerful Sarah Churchill (1660\u20131744) and the wily Abigail Hill (1670\u20131734). Terms such as \u2018favourite\u2019 and \u2018close companion\u2019 have often been used to euphemistically describe same-sex relationships, and these types of relationship are at the heart of The Favourite. But is all of this fiction to win an Oscar, or is there basis in fact?\nWhat we do have are letters and reports and a long history of biographies of Anne littered with terms full of double meaning, such as \u2018passionate friendship\u2019. The queen\u2019s contemporaries even spoke of her \u2018unnatural attachments\u2019 to other women. After Anne and Sarah Churchill\u2019s relationship turned sour, Sarah wrote that Anne had \u2018no inclination for any but her own sex\u2019 despite the potential damage this might have done to Sarah\u2019s own reputation. Historical hearsay to some, perhaps, but it is by no means a phrase that only carries Sapphic connotations to modern eyes. Sarah knew the power of her words.\nAnne may not have acted on her desires, but there is significant evidence that Anne, like her great grandfather James I/VI (1566\u20131625), felt a strong attraction to her own sex.\nBank of Duckie 9 Bob Note \u2013 Peter O\u2019Hanlon, LGBTQ Tour Volunteer, British Museum\nThe two sides of the Bank of Duckie nine-shilling note on display in Room 68.\nWho remembers the ten shilling note or the \u2018ten bob note\u2019 as it was once known? The note was withdrawn from circulation in 1970 and disappeared in tandem with the popular expression with which it was so closely bound, \u2018as queer as a nine bob note\u2019. In 2008 the Museum\u2019s 9 Bob Note was issued by Duckie for use during their club event Gay Shame goes Macho. It reads: \u2018The Bank of Duckie promises to pay the Bearer on Demand the sum of Nine Shillings\u2019 \u2013 a rubber duck has replaced Britannia and most surprising of all a portrait of Ronnie Kray occupies the spot where we might anticipate the Queen. In the margin of the cameo the image asks \u2018Do you know my face?\u2019. Yet, for all these changes the design skilfully evokes the appearance of the original ten shilling note.\nRonnie Kray (1933\u20131995) together with his twin Reggie (1933\u20132000) was imprisoned for life in 1969. The East End gang leader was acknowledged by many, including himself, to be gay. With its combination of wit, audacity, and humour the note is easily my favourite object on the current LGBTQ tour and I suspect a particularly memorable object for many of those visitors who have enjoyed it with me.\nThe Rosetta Stone \u2013 Jack Shoulder, Museum Education Specialist and LGBTQ Historian\nThe Rosetta Stone on display in Room 4.\nThe Rosetta Stone is the most-visited object in the British Museum. People travel from all over the world to cast their eyes in wonder over the inscriptions that unlocked the ancient world. It tells a powerful story about international co-operation, with French and British scholars pooling their knowledge to solve the mysteries of the languages scratched into the stone.\nIt is well known that the Rosetta Stone has two languages and three scripts \u2013 hieroglyphs, Demotic and Ancient Greek. Walk around the Stone and you will find: \u2018CAPTURED IN EGYPT BY THE BRITISH ARMY IN 1801 PRESENTED BY KING GEORGE III\u2019. Another language.\nThe Rosetta Stone still has the power to surprise us. Allow me to reveal to you its LGBTQ connection, highlighted by former British Museum curator Professor Richard B Parkinson in his book A Little Gay History. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion (1790\u20131832) and Thomas Young\u2019s (1773\u20131829) correspondence in cracking the cryptic code is famous. Less well-known is the impact of a third contributor \u2013 William John Bankes (1786\u20131855), christened by poet Lord Byron (1788\u20131824) as \u2018the Father of all Mischief\u2019!\nBankes made important breakthroughs in the understanding of the stone. He discussed the possibility the texts might all say the same thing, and he correctly supposed that a recurring cartouche represented a royal name. While travelling around Egypt, he made several studies which informed Young\u2019s work. Without Bankes\u2019 input our understanding of the stone, and ancient Egypt, would be significantly less.\nBut why don\u2019t we know about Bankes and his contribution? Possibly because of his \u2018mischief\u2019.\nIn 1833 Bankes was tried for soliciting a guardsman in a public toilet. He was acquitted but retired from public life. In 1841 he was forced to flee England after being committed for trial for \u2018that detestable & abominable crime (amongst Christians not to be named) called Buggery\u2026\u2019 \u2013 Bankes was gay, and committed the crime of getting caught. His punishment was exile, and his achievements unfairly obscured.\nPrint depicting the Chevalier d\u2019Eon \u2013 E-J Scott, Queer History Curator, DUCKIE, Museum of Transology\nThe trial of M. D\u2019Eon by a jury of matrons. Etching with engraving, 1771.\nThis etching from 1771 is an astonishing example of the enduring relevance of the British Museum\u2019s collection to LGBTQI+ lives today. The trial of M. D\u2019Eon by a Jury of Matrons, depicts the \u2018Chevalier\u2019 D\u2019Eon (1728\u20131810) stationed on a plinth akin to an ancient Greek statue. Despite being shown to be a decorated soldier wearing the Croix de Saint-Louis, a French military medal, the Chevalier is ironically reduced to half the stature of the jurors, suggesting their body did not reach full development. The tiny D\u2019Eon is scantily draped in cloth, a bare buttock revealing them to be stark naked underneath. The twelve onlooking matrons whisper and gawp, anticipating the \u2018big reveal\u2019 that will allow them to cast judgement, once and for all, on whether or not the Chevalier\u2019s anatomy is aligned with their gender presentation.\nD\u2019Eon\u2019s sex was a source of fascination for the British press and its public throughout the last half of the 18th century and beyond. They were repeatedly ridiculed as half-man, half-woman, as can be seen in engravings from 1777 and 1778. The British Museum\u2019s collection reveals D\u2019Eon occupied both male and female gender identities in both public and private life, living in older age \u2013 and dying \u2013 as a woman. Even their corpse was subjected to public scrutiny, with a post mortem enabling a medical illustrator to draw their shrivelled genitalia in minute biological detail. The drawing was even engraved for the purposes of reprinting \u2013 one of the prints is preserved in the Museum\u2019s collection. It should serve to illustrate to us that 250 years later, trans, non-binary and intersex lives and bodies continue to be subjected to the same brutal, invasive and demeaning public scrutiny. This Pride, we should reflect upon the fact that this 18th-century jury could just as readily be assembled today.\nRead more about the Chevalier\u2019s story here.\nThe Justin Fashanu Story \u2013 Rachel Ridealgh, Community Librarian for Local Studies, Norfolk Library and Information Service\nForbidden Forward: The Justin Fashanu Story by Nick Baker, and Justin Fashanu All-Stars fabric patch, and Justin Campaign badge.\nThese objects represent the story of Justin Fashanu (1961\u20131998), a British footballer who began his career with Norwich City Football Club in the late 1970s. Fashanu was the first professional footballer in England to come out as gay and to this day is the only British male professional player to have done so. These objects were chosen for inclusion in the Desire, Love, Identity exhibition by Norfolk Heritage Centre\u2019s young Community Curators group because of the challenges faced by Fashanu as a gay, Black professional footballer, and his inspiring legacy.\nFashanu transferred to Nottingham Forest from Norwich City in 1981 and was the first Black footballer to command a one million pound transfer fee. His time at Nottingham Forest was fraught, clashing with manager Brian Clough (1935\u20132004) over his sexuality. In October 1990 Fashanu came out as gay in an interview with The Sun newspaper, after which he suffered homophobic backlash. Eight years later, Fashanu was accused of sexual assault while living in the United States. He returned to England and died by suicide two months after the accusations were made.\nThe Justin Fashanu All-stars was a football team formed in 2009, supported by the FA. The team was created by the Justin Campaign, which is a campaign against homophobia in football and promotes the inclusion of openly gay footballers. Also inspired by Justin Fashanu and his legacy, the Proud Canaries LGBTQ+ supporters group was launched in Norwich in 2014. They promote inclusion and challenge discrimination in football, as well as having their own Proud Canaries football team.\nThe Bolton Whitman Fellowship, 1894 \u2013 Matthew Watson, Curator of art and social history, Bolton Museum\nPhotograph of Bolton Whitman Fellowship, Rivington, near Bolton, July 1894. This photograph featured in Bolton Museum\u2019s version of Desire, love, identity, in a section called Friendship as a Way of Life, which explored some of the friendship networks that helped to sustain local LGBTQ people in difficult times.\nThe Bolton Whitman Fellowship began meeting in the terraced house of the group\u2019s guiding spirit, James William Wallace (1853\u20131926), in the 1880s. Early on, the Fellowship was a band of mainly working-class young men whose sense of group identity was fostered through a shared love of American poet Walt Whitman (1819\u20131892). News of the group spread around Britain and in the United States, and its network began to widen, encompassing such figures as writer and campaigner for homosexual equality Edward Carpenter (1844\u20131929), and Katharine Glasier (1867\u20131950), a founder member of the Independent Labour Party.\nThis photograph of the Bolton Whitman Fellowship enjoying what looks like a tea party was taken in July 1894, when they had gathered to welcome the American Whitmanite, singer and composer Philip Dalmas (1870\u20131925). Dalmas seems to have aroused strong feelings among certain members of the Fellowship, and there is evidence to suggest that he had an affair with at least one of the group \u2013 Charles Sixsmith (1871\u20131953), who worked in a local textile mill. Dalmas is second on the left, in the middle row (with a moustache, looking at the camera), while Sixsmith is sitting in the front row on a winged-back chair, in profile.\nWe hold numerous photographs of the Bolton Whitman Fellowship in our collections, but this is my favourite. For me, it captures something of the spirit of the 1890s and early 1900s, when, for a brief period, boundaries began to break down between people of different social and economic backgrounds and between the sexes. It was an incredible, though short-lived moment of hope, tolerance and openness (including towards sexual difference) in which socialists, feminists, religious dissenters, and campaigners for sexual equality were united in common cause.\nWoodblock fan print depicting Iwai Hanshir\u014d V \u2013 Stuart Frost, Head of Interpretation and Volunteers, British Museum\nUtagawa Kunisada (1786\u20131864), Kabuki actor Iwai Hanshir\u014d V offstage arranging irises. Colour woodblock print, 1820s.\nThis woodblock print from the 1820s, designed by the artist Utagawa Kunisada (1786\u20131864), is a recent acquisition that was put on display in late 2019.\nThe Museum\u2019s collection of Japanese woodblock prints and illustrated books produced between 1600\u20131900 contains numerous important works that reflect LGBTQ themes. These works are sensitive to light which means that they can\u2019t be on permanent display, but our curatorial team ensures that there is always at least one work with an LGBTQ connection on display at any given time in Rooms 92\u201394.\nA print like this shouldn\u2019t really have survived. It was designed to be cut out and mounted onto a round summer fan with a bamboo handle and then thrown away. Hardly any of these types of print survive, and this is the only known example of this one. It depicts the male kabuki actor, Iwai Hanshir\u014d V (1776\u20131847). In around 1629 women were banned from appearing on the kabuki stage, and from that point onwards men performed female roles. Some actors, like Iwai Hanshir\u014d V, specialised in female roles and they are frequently shown living their lives outside the theatre in feminine clothing. Here for example, Hanshir\u014d is shown off-stage, arranging flowers.\nMoving beyond this particular print, Utagawa Kunisada produced thousands of designs for actor prints over his career, including some sexually explicit shunga books that featured scandals about the private lives of actors. Young actors of female roles would sometimes provide sexual services to older male \u2013 and occasionally female \u2013 patrons.\nYou can find other LGBTQ stories from the collection on our webpage here, including more blogs posts, objects in focus and an online trail of objects with LGBTQ connections around the Museum.

In the classical world it was part of occasions from religious rites to ostentatious parties. There is plenty of information available on what the ancient Greeks and Romans ate and drank \u2013 in written texts and in archaeological finds \u2013 which can help us bring their gastronomical creations to life in the 21st century.\nHere we have compiled a few recipes from the ancient world, which you can recreate at home to make your own classical feast! These recipes are from The Classical Cookbook, by Andrew Dalby and Sally Grainger, which uses Greek and Latin texts to create dishes from Homeric Greece to the Roman Empire.\nAthenian\u00a0stamnos\u00a0(storage jar) showing men at a symposion. Greek. 450\u2013440 BC.\nStarters, sides and snacks\n1) Cabbage the Athenian way (vg)\nBronze grater. Greek. 5th century BC.\n\u2018Cabbage should be sliced with the sharpest possible iron blade, then washed, drained, and chopped with plenty of coriander and rue. Then sprinkle with honey vinegar and add just a little bit of silphium. Incidentally, you can eat this as a meze.\u2019 \u2013 Mnesitheus, quoted in Oribasius, Medical Collections 4, 4, 1\nThis is a popular recipe among Greek and Roman writers. Oribasius (4th century AD), a well-known doctor of the late Roman Empire, borrowed it from a much older book of dietary advice by Mnesitheus, a medical writer from Athens who lived in the 4th century BC.\nDoctors were interested in this dish because it was said to cure headaches and was good for stomach upsets. Pliny claimed if taken before a meal it prevented drunkenness, and if taken after drinking it could cure a hangover!\nWhatever its medicinal value, Mnesitheus was quite right about cabbage in honey vinegar being delicious as a starter or side dish and it\u2019s simple to make.\nSubstitute honey for maple syrup to make this recipe vegan.\nServes 6\nIngredients\n\u2022 1 small white cabbage\n\u2022 2 heaped tsp chopped fresh green coriander in oil\n\u2022 2 tsp chopped fresh or dried rue (you can use a bitter a bitter herb or spice such as fenugreek seed as a substitute)\n\u2022 2 pinches asafoetida powder (you can use garlic or onion powder as a substitute)\n\u2022 Salt\nHoney vinegar\n\u2022 120g honey\n\u2022 2 tbsp red wine vinegar\nMethod\nFirst make the honey vinegar. Boil the honey and skim it, add the vinegar and reduce a little. Store until needed. Finely slice the cabbage, wash and drain it. Toss with the herbs and 3 tablespoons of honey vinegar and sprinkle with the asafoetida powder and a little salt.\n2) Very garlicy garlic cheese (vg)\nTerracotta figure of a mule carrying a mortarium (grinding bowl). Inside it are a pestle, a cheese-grater, a round cheese, and a bunch of garlic. Greek, around 350 BC.\n\u2018First, lightly digging into the ground with his \ufb01ngers, he pulls up four heads of garlic with their thick leaves; then he picks slim celery-tops and sturdy rue and the thin stems of trembling coriander\u2026 He splashes a grass-grown bulb with water and puts it to the hollow mortar. He seasons with grains of salt, and, after the salt, hard cheese is added; then he mixes in the herbs. With the pestle, his right hand works at the \ufb01ery garlic, then he crushes all alike in a mixture\u2026 So he sprinkles in some drops of Athena\u2019s olive oil, and adds a little sharp vinegar, and again works his mixture together. Then at length he runs two \ufb01ngers round the mortar, gathering the whole mixture into a ball, so as to produce the form and name of a \ufb01nished moretum.\u2019 \u2013 Moretum 88\u2013120\nThis \ufb01ery moretum (garlic cheese) is not for the faint hearted! If we take the recipe at face value, it may include \ufb01fty cloves of garlic, a pretty potent mixture! But surprisingly good with a fresh warm loaf of bread and a few olives. This is a simple rustic meal, which ordinary farmers would likely have eaten.\nThe poem Moretum is sometimes attributed to Virgil, author of the Aeneid.\nGreeks and Romans used a mortar for grinding and mixing sauces. In this case the farmer would have used a large, coarsely made bowl with a grainy texture that helped to break down the ingredients. If you have a food processor, the effort required to produce the dish is minimal. If, on the other hand, you have to (or want to!) grind by hand you will need a large pestle and mortar.\nServes 6\nIngredients\n\u2022 2 heads (20\u201325 cloves) garlic\n\u2022 225g Pecorino Romano cheese\n\u2022 1 large handful of coriander leaves\n\u2022 2 heaped teaspoons chopped fresh celery leaf\n\u2022 1 tsp salt\n\u2022 1 tbsp white wine vinegar\n\u2022 1 tbsp olive oil\nMethod\nPeel and roughly chop the garlic. Grate the cheese. Roughly chop the herbs. If you are grinding by hand, start with the garlic and salt; break it down to a pulp, then add the cheese and herbs. When you have a smooth mixture add the liquids and mix well. If you are using a food processor, add all the solid ingredients and process until the mixture is smooth in texture, then add the liquids. Gather the mixture together and chill. Serve with a crusty loaf as a snack.\n3) Olive Relish (ve)\nOlive harvest in the countryside. Athenian black-figure amphora attributed to the Antimenes Painter. Greek, around 520 BC.\n\u2018How to make green, black or mixed olive relish. Remove stones from green, black or mixed olives, then prepare as follows: chop them and add oil, vinegar, coriander, cumin, fennel, rue, mint. Pot them: the oil should cover them. Ready to use.\u2019 \u2013 Cato, On Agriculture 119\nThe recipe from Cato dates to about 200 BC, but olives provided relish and \ufb02avouring all through ancient times. The olive tree had been under cultivation in Greece for a thousand years, if not longer, when the Iliad and Odyssey were composed (around the 8th century BC). At classical Greek banquets olives were served in brine, and sometimes, no doubt, they were served as relishes like this.\nCato\u2019s recipe uses cumin, but it can overpower the herbs, so it is listed as optional below. Fennel leaf will not be easy to \ufb01nd unless you grow it yourself, so the chopped root will serve as a substitute. To make life easier buy good quality pitted olives.\nServes 4\nIngredients\n\u2022 120g black olives\n\u2022 120g green olives\n\u2022 4 tbsp red wine vinegar\n\u2022 4 tbsp olive oil\n\u2022 1 heaped tsp chopped fennel leaf or \ufb01nely diced fennel root\n\u2022 1/2 level tsp ground cumin (optional)\n\u2022 2 tsp chopped fresh coriander\n\u2022 2 tsp dried or chopped fresh rue (you can use a bitter a bitter herb or spice such as fenugreek seed as a substitute)\n\u2022 2 heaped tsp dried or 3 tsp chopped fresh mint\nMethod\nChop the olives roughly and pour on the vinegar and olive oil. Prepare the herbs, chopping them \ufb01nely if fresh, and add to the mixture. Place the olive relish in a sealable container and pour a little olive oil over the top. At this stage it can be eaten, as Cato \ufb01rmly says, but it does improve with a few days\u2019 marinating. Try it with pitta bread, accompanied by a sharp sheep\u2019s cheese such as feta.\nMains\n4) Honey glazed prawns\nPanel from a mosaic pavement showing baskets of fish and fruit. It may have decorated a dining-room. Roman (Carthage), 1st\u20132nd century AD.\nThis recipe is adapted from various ancient sources \u2013 a poem attributed to the Greek poet Philoxenus of Cythera talks about shrimps glazed with honey being served at a banquet, but it does not help in recreating the dish! Fish sauce (for its salt) and olive oil would undoubtedly have been among the ingredients, along with the honey. Oregano is suggested as the Greeks used it in seafood dishes.\nServes 2\nIngredients\n\u2022 225g large raw peeled prawns\n\u2022 1 tbsp olive oil\n\u2022 2 tbsp \ufb01sh sauce\n\u2022 1 tbsp clear honey\n\u2022 2 tsp chopped fresh oregano\n\u2022 Black pepper\nMethod\nIf using frozen prawns, ensure that they are well defrosted and drained. Place the oil, \ufb01sh sauce and honey in a saucepan and add the prawns. Saut\u00e9 them gently in the sauce for 2 or 3 minutes until they are tender. Remove with a perforated spoon and keep warm. Continue to cook the sauce until it has reduced by half. Add the chopped oregano and pour the sauce over the shrimps. Sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper. Serve as a \ufb01rst course with a crusty loaf of bread and a simple salad.\n5) Roast lamb or kid\nRed-figured stamnos (storage jar), showing meat being roasted on a spit over a fire as part of a sacrifice. Greek, 450\u2013430 BC.\n\u2018Marinated kid or lamb: 1 pint milk, 4 oz honey, 1 oz pepper, a little salt, a little asafoetida. For the sauce: 2 \ufb02 oz oil, 2 \ufb02 oz fish sauce, 2 \ufb02 oz honey, 8 crushed dates, half pint good wine, a little starch.\u2019 \u2013 Apicius 8, 6, 7\nThis recipe is from Apicius, a Roman cookery book of different recipes thought to have been compiled in the 1st century AD. This recipe is one of the few in the book that gives quantities, which has led some to believe that this might in fact be an old ancient Greek recipe.\nThe recipe is particularly good with kid if you can \ufb01nd it but otherwise you can use lamb.\nServes 6\nIngredients\n\u2022 Shoulder of kid or 1.25 kg leg of lamb\n\u2022 Olive oil\nMarinade\n\u2022 570ml milk\n\u2022 120g clear honey\n\u2022 1 tbsp pepper\n\u2022 Salt\n\u2022 1/2 tsp asafoetida powder or 5 drops asafoetida tincture (you can use garlic or onion powder as a substitute)\nSauce\n\u2022 8 crushed fresh or dried dates\n\u2022 280ml red wine\n\u2022 4 tbsp olive oil\n\u2022 2 tbsp clear honey\n\u2022 4 tbsp \ufb01sh sauce\n\u2022 A little corn\ufb02our (corn starch)\nMethod\nFor best results, you\u2019ll want to marinate the meat overnight. Combine the marinade ingredients and leave the meat overnight in the marinade, turning it occasionally to ensure full absorption. At the same time, soak the fresh or dried dates in a little red wine. The next day remove the meat from the marinade, pat it dry, and then roast it in an oven pre-heated to 200\u00b0C/gas mark 6, well-seasoned and with olive oil. The timing should be 20 minutes to each 1lb (450g) and 20 minutes in addition. When the meat is nearly ready, pound the dates to a pulp and add to the remaining red wine, honey, \ufb01sh sauce and oil. Bring to the boil in a saucepan and cook out brie\ufb02y and then thicken with corn\ufb02our (corn starch, you can mix with a little water to avoid lumps). When the joint is cooked, remove it from the oven and leave to rest for 10 minutes before carving thick slices and serving with a little of the sauce on the side.\n6) Squash/marrow Alexandria style\nTerracotta model of a basket containing various fruits (a pomegranate, an apple, a fig, an almond and a small marrow). Greek, around 450 BC.\n\u2018Gourd Alexandrian fashion. Drain boiled gourd, season with salt, arrange in a dish. Crush pepper, cumin, coriander seed, fresh mint, asafoetida root. Moisten with vinegar. Add caryota date, pine kernel; crush. Blend with honey, vinegar, \ufb01sh sauce, concentrated must and oil, and pour the whole over the gourd. When it has boiled, season with pepper and serve.\u2019 \u2013 Apicius 4, 2, 14\nThis dish is the sort of simple dinner that Romans would likely have had in bars and restaurants where you could easily while away an evening. We have substituted the gourds that the Romans grew for marrow or squash.\nSubstitute the fish sauce for soy sauce to make this recipe vegetarian.\nServes 6\nIngredients\n\u2022 1 small young marrow or yellow squash\n\u2022 Salt\n\u2022 4 fresh dates, soaked in a little wine\n\u2022 2 tbsp pine kernels, soaked in a little wine\n\u2022 2 level tsp ground cumin\n\u2022 2 level tsp ground coriander\n\u2022 1/2 tsp ground black pepper\n\u2022 2 tsp chopped fresh or 2 tsp dried mint\n\u2022 1/2 tsp asafoetida powder or 5 drops asafoetida tincture (you can use garlic or onion powder as a substitute)\n\u2022 2 tbsp honey\n\u2022 1 tbsp defrutum (reduced red grape juice) (you can use 2 tbsp of red wine as a substitute)\n\u2022 3 tbsp \ufb01sh sauce\n\u2022 2 tbsp olive oil\n\u2022 3 tbsp red wine vinegar\nMethod\nSlice the marrow or squash and boil until al dente (still \ufb01rm). Arrange the slices in a baking dish and sprinkle with a little salt. You will need a pestle and mortar for the sauce. Remove the stones from the dates and put the \ufb02esh in the mortar with the pine kernels. Mash them down to a paste. Transfer to a bowl and add the cumin, coriander, pepper, mint and asafoetida and mix well. Scrape down the mash and add the honey, defrutum, oil, \ufb01sh sauce and vinegar. Stir into a smooth emulsion and pour over the marrow or squash. Cover with a lid or foil and reheat thoroughly in a pre-heated oven at 180\u00b0C/gas mark 4. Serve sprinkled with freshly ground pepper.\nDesserts\n7) Pancakes with Honey and Sesame Seeds (vg)\nTerracotta figure of a woman grinding grain. Greek, 5th century BC.\n\u2018Let us find time to speak of other cakes, the ones made with wheat \ufb02our. Teganitai, as we call them, are made simply with oil. The oil is put in a frying-pan resting on a smokeless \ufb01re, and when it has heated, the wheat \ufb02our, mixed with plenty of water, is poured on. Rapidly, as it fries in the oil, it sets and thickens like fresh cheese setting in the baskets. And at this point the cooks turn it, putting the visible side under, next to the pan, and bringing the sufficiently fried side, which was underneath at \ufb01rst, up on to the top, and when the underneath is set they turn it again another two or maybe three times till they think it is all equally cooked. Some mix it with honey, and others again with sea-salt.\u2019 \u2013 Galen, On the Properties of Foods 1, 3\nIt\u2019s amazing how little food changes from one millennium to the next. When reading the Roman physician Galen\u2019s description of making pancakes, it is hard to remember that he is writing 1,800 years ago! The early Greek poet Hipponax had written of pancakes \u2018drugged with sesame seeds\u2019. This was likely a breakfast meal and one that was possibly sold on the streets of ancient Athens from portable braziers. These pancakes are thicker than the cr\u00eape-style pancakes familiar to us (more like a blini, or even thicker) and they are served with honey and toasted sesame seeds.\nSubstitute honey for maple or date syrup to make these vegan.\nServes 4\nIngredients\n\u2022 120g \ufb02our\n\u2022 225 ml water\n\u2022 2 tbsp clear honey\n\u2022 Oil for frying\n\u2022 1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds\nMethod\nMix the \ufb02our, water and one tablespoon of honey together into a batter. Heat two tablespoons of oil in a frying-pan and pour a quarter of the mixture in. When it has set, turn it two or three times to give an even colour. Cook three more pancakes in the same way. Serve all four pancakes hot with the remainder of the honey poured over and sprinkled with sesame seeds.\n8) Cheesecake (vg)\nBronze baking-pan for cakes and bread-rolls. Roman, 1st century AD.\n\u2018Libum to be made as follows: 2 lb cheese well crushed in a mortar; when it is well crushed, add in 1 lb bread-wheat \ufb02our or, if you want it to be lighter, just half a pound, to be mixed well with the cheese. Add one egg and mix all together well. Make a loaf of this, with leaves under it, and cook slowly in a hot \ufb01re under a brick.\u2019 \u2013 Cato, On Agriculture 7\nLibum means \u2018cake\u2019 in Latin. There were many types of Roman cakes from sacri\ufb01cial cake, offered to household spirits, to farmhouse cake, served hot, and delicate honeyed cake that was served at the very end of an elaborate Roman dinner. The poet Ovid, writing of Roman religious festivals, tells us some tantalising details. He talks of a libum infused with clear honey \u2013 and he traces the origin of these cakes all the way back to mythology, and to the discovery of honey by the god Bacchus.\nThis recipe is inspired by Cato\u2019s recipe but uses honey to make it sweet. You can make a savoury version without the honey by using a salted cheese, such as feta.\nServes 2\nIngredients\n\u2022 90g plain \ufb02our\n\u2022 250g ricotta cheese\n\u2022 1 egg\n\u2022 2 bay leaves\n\u2022 2 tbsp clear honey\nMethod\nGrease a baking tray and place two large bay leaves in the centre. Beat the cheese until smooth, add the egg and beat again to incorporate it. Sieve the flour, and add two tablespoons to the cheese mixture one at a time, stirring gently and slowly between each addition until they are incorporated. Gather the remaining \ufb02our and sprinkle over the mixture and on to the hands before gathering up the soft dough and very gently forming it into a round ball. Do not knead or in any way attempt to blend all the \ufb02our fully into the mixture. Place the ball directly onto the bay leaves. You can cover the cake in an earthenware vessel for authenticity or bake it as it is in a hot oven (200\u00b0C/gas mark 7) until golden brown and \ufb01rm to the touch for 20\u201325 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately score the cake across the centre and pour the warmed clear honey into the gap. Serve at once before it begins to cool.\n9) Delian Sweets (vg)\nBlack-figured amphora showing four men surrounded by bees. These men are Laios, Keleos, Kerberos, and Aigolios,who according to Greek myth, plundered from the hives the honey on which the god Zeus was nourished as an infant. Greek, around 540 BC.\n\u2018On Hecate\u2019s Island,\u2019 says Semus in Deliad II, \u2018the Delians sacri\ufb01ce what they call basyniai to Iris, goddess of the dawn. It is wheat dough, boiled, with honey and the so-called kokkora (which are a dried \ufb01g and three walnuts).\u2018 \u2013 Athenaeus 645\n\u2018Another sweet: Take durum wheat \ufb02our and cook it in hot water so that it forms a very hard paste, then spread it on a plate. When cold cut it up in lozenges, and fry in best oil. Lift out, pour honey over, sprinkle with pepper and serve.\u2019 \u2013 Apicius 7, 11, 6\nThis recipe is from the Greek island of Delos. The recipe from Athenaeus is sketchy and difficult to interpret. Were the dried \ufb01g and the walnuts ingredients in basyniai, or were they a separate offering to the goddess? Here we have assumed that they were separate \u2013 you can serve the figs alongside your Delian Sweets. The second recipe, quoted from Apicius, is a little clearer as to the method of making he sweets.\nPepper was once very common as a seasoning for sweets. It is surprisingly good with honey. Nutmeg has commonly replaced pepper in desserts and sweet cookery, but nutmeg was practically unknown to the classical Greeks and Romans.\nSubstitute honey for maple or date syrup to make these vegan.\nMakes about 15\nIngredients\n\u2022 170ml water\n\u2022 60g plain (all-purpose) \ufb02our\n\u2022 Olive oil for deep-frying\n\u2022 2 tbsp honey\n\u2022 Poppy seeds or freshly ground black pepper\nMethod\nBring the water to the boil and add the sifted flour in one go, beating vigorously to incorporate. Cook out for a few minutes and turn out on to a large plate, or a marble slab if you have one. Allow to cool completely. Heat the olive oil in a deep-fryer or pan. Cut the paste into cubes \u2013 it will be \ufb01rm but still a little sticky. Test the oil for temperature with a little of the mixture \u2013 if it rises and colours, the oil is ready. Drop the cubes in the oil, 2 or 3 at a time. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until golden-brown and lift out on to kitchen paper. While they are still warm, garnish with a little warmed honey over the fritters and sprinkle them with either poppy seeds or freshly ground pepper.\nMiniature red-figured vase showing two boys around a table of food and drink.

Thebes is the main city of \u2018Upper Egypt\u2019, the southern region of the country that extends to Nubia. The Egyptian king (or pharaoh) rules over both Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt, with both areas defined by the course of the River Nile.\nTwo views of the ruins of Thebes.\nVue des Ruines de Thebes a Karnaq (top) and Autre Vue de Karnaq (bottom). Anthony Cardon. After Baron Dominique Vivant Denon. Etching with engraving. Around 1802.\nThe city has recently been the focus of a significant building programme under the reigning king Ramesses II, with monumental new constructions for the gods. Residential areas, temples, festival sites, government buildings, and industrial areas are found on either side of the Nile, with vast cemeteries in the low hills of the West bank.\nWhen to visit\nThebes is one of the driest and hottest areas in Egypt, and temperatures can be sweltering throughout the summer months. If you have to visit during this time, be prepared for some serious heat! During the Nile flood, which reaches Thebes in July and August, temples can also be inundated and tracks across agricultural areas difficult to navigate. We\u2019d recommend visiting during the cooler winter months to make the most of your trip, but the summer months do have some great festivals so it depends what takes your fancy.\nLord Henry Scott, Across the Nile to Luxor. 1832\u20131905.\nWatercolour, heightened with white\nTravel\nPhotograph of a group of people travelling through the desert near Thebes. Photograph by Hunt. Around 1917.\nThe city of Thebes covers an area of around 93 square kilometres, and walking around the major parts of the city \u2013 depending on how hot it is \u2013 will be possible since major parts of the city are all located across the East bank of the Nile.\nVarious desert routes around Thebes are well established, facilitating trade from areas such as the Kharga oasis (around 200 kilometres, or 125 miles, away) in the Western desert where wine is produced (more on that later). There\u2019s also a larger network of routes between towns and villages in the local area. Exploring these more remote sites will require a donkey to traverse the terrain, though it is well worth it to gain a glimpse of marvellous items arriving from far away areas such as Nubia, where many precious materials like gold are found.\nWooden model of boat with crew. Egypt. 12th Dynasty (1991\u20131802 BC).\nThe most efficient way to travel is via boat along the Nile. Not only does this provide spectacular views, particularly of the sunset behind the Western burial grounds, but accessible harbours allow for quick and easy \u2018hops\u2019 from one side of the Nile to the other.\nWhere to stay\nThebes is a densely populated city, with the majority of locals living within the town along the East bank of the Nile in mudbrick structures. We\u2019d recommend staying here if you can as these places are all close to the main attractions and the temples being visited and enhanced by the king. Another residential village site on the West bank is also worth a visit, which we\u2019ll learn more about later.\nThings to do\nThebes has been transformed by the current pharaoh Ramesses II, with new temples adorned by colossal statues of the king himself and large obelisks inscribed with his name and titles.\nThings had not always been so prosperous here \u2013 less than 50 years ago under Akhenaten\u2019s (1352\u20131336 BC) religious revolution, many religious spaces and shrines for the traditional gods were closed, with only new temples to the sun-disc, the Aten, remaining open.\nMoving from the East bank where the sun rises to the West bank where the sun sets, there are a number of amazing sights to see:\nKarnak and Luxor temples\nYou can\u2019t visit Thebes without exploring the city\u2019s largest temple sites. They have a rich history, with some parts already many centuries old. Luxor temple\u2019s structure was built by king Amenhotep III who reigned some 100 years ago. He recorded his architectural achievements in a stela from his mortuary temple: \u2018It pleased his majesty\u2019s heart to make very great monuments, the likes of which had not existed\u2026\u2019. His structure at Luxor and his enhancements at Karnak include \u2018pavements of pure silver\u2019, and pylons and twin towers at each site respectively \u2018reaching to the sky\u2019.\nBronze incense-burner. Egypt. Late Period (712\u2013323 BC).\nBoth Karnak and Luxor temple are dedicated to forms of Amun-Ra, the creator god, and both are a constant bustle of sound, sights, and smells. Incense, myrrh and scented oils are regularly used as offerings to the god.\nDetail of a papyrus from the \u2018Book of the Dead\u2019, showing a priest holding an incense burner and pouring liquid from a tall libation vase. Egypt. 19th Dynasty (1292\u20131189 BC).\nThe priesthood responsible for the running of the temples provide a continuous buzz through spoken rituals, the playing of musical instruments, and the regular sound of construction as enhancements and improvements to the temple ordered by the pharaoh.\nHenry Stanier.

Watercolour and bodycolour. 1868\n\nView of the temple complex at Karnak.\nBaron Dominique Vivant Denon, Autre vue de Qarn\u00e2q, from \u2018Voyage dans la Basse et la Haute Egypte, pendant les campagnes du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Bonaparte\u2019. Pen and grey ink, grey wash. Around 1802.\nThough access to the inner spaces of any Egyptian temple is prohibited to anyone other than those in the royal family or high status priests, you may be able to venture into the outer courtyards and admire the beautifully carved and painted reliefs which decorate the high walls of the temples, depicting the kings and the gods.\nDrawing of a relief from the temple of Karnak.\nBaron Dominique Vivant Denon, historiques du temple de Qarn\u00e2q \u00e0 Th\u00e8bes for \u2018Voyage dans la Basse et la Haute Egypte, pendant les campagnes du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Bonaparte\u2019. Pen and grey ink. Around 1802.\nColossal statues of Ramesses II and monumental obelisks now frame the entrance. These monuments are visible long before you reach the structure itself, and the Luxor site has also been enhanced with a new courtyard that lengthens the whole complex.\nWatercolour showing Luxor. There are fortifications to right with huge seated sculpted figure and monumental stone needle.\nOwen Jones, Luxor. Watercolour, 1809\u20131874.\nRamesseum\nThe pharaoh is currently building a huge temple on the opposing West bank of the Nile, and though you may wish to leave the workers to it, the flurry of activity as huge blocks of mudbrick are being lifted, worked on and set into the structure, is a true spectacle to behold. Like the Luxor temple, you will spot this site immediately as there are large statues of the king framing the entrance way.\nStatue of Ramesses II, the \u2018Younger Memnon\u2019. 19th Dynasty (1292\u20131189 BC).\nChat to a local, and they\u2019ll tell you this temple will be a place for the king\u2019s cult to be celebrated for eternity. It will serve as a place for the populace to pay their respects to the king after he dies rather than visiting his tomb, as access to royal burial sites is strictly prohibited.\nDrawing showing the ruins of the mortuary temple of Ramesses II.\nBaron Dominique Vivant Denon, Le Memnonium, from \u2018Voyage dans la Basse et la Haute Egypte, pendant les campagnes du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Bonaparte\u2019. Pen and grey ink, with grey wash, over graphite. Around 1802.\nRamesses\u2019 temple does not stand in isolation; in fact, the mortuary temples of many earlier kings are located in this same area. At the foot of the cliffs, the temple of Mentuhotep II, a king from centuries ago, features exquisite reliefs showing military scenes. It\u2019s an opportunity to admire the skills of the local craftsmen, who carve beautifully executed hieroglyphs and relief scenes to decorate the structures, many of which demonstrate the king\u2019s military prowess and defeat of Egypt\u2019s enemies.\nLimestone relief of Mentuhotep II. Egypt. 2055\u20132004 BC.\nThe elite tombs\nBehind these royal creations and further north, you can explore large cemetery spaces of the elite. It is customary for the Egyptians to honour the dead in their tombs, just as they also pay their respects to the kings of the past.\nFragment of a polychrome tomb painting. Egypt. Around 1350 BC.\nThe tomb of Nebamun and his wife is particularly stunning, with beautifully painted reliefs depicting an elite life of banquets, music and celebrations, which Nebamun must have hoped would continue for eternity. Though it is customary for people to enter these chapel spaces, access to the inner burial areas is strictly prohibited.\nThe local area\nThere are many attractive places within the Theban area to experience a sense of Egyptian daily life. Many residential areas lie close to the city\u2019s attractions on the East bank, nearby the necessities such as the markets and the sacred temple spaces. On the West bank behind the temple of Ramesses you\u2019ll find the isolated site of Deir el-Medina which is an interesting place to visit.\nDeir el-Medina\nThe site of Deir el-Medina houses the builders, workmen, and artists who construct the enormous tombs of the pharaohs and their families. It is not a typical village by any means, but it\u2019s great for people-watching and finding out about the lives of those dedicated to creating the funerary spaces of their leaders.\nPostcard showing a photograph of the site of Deir el-Medina. Egypt. Around 1960\u20131980.\nThe houses in Deir el-Medina tend to be mudbrick structures, often tightly packed together along narrow alleyways. Should you be lucky enough to be invited into a typical Egyptian home, you will normally encounter a structure with three or four small rooms, and a staircase leading up to a terrace or upper storey. If you\u2019re looking to find your way to a friend\u2019s place, it\u2019s easy as door lintels are painted red and inscribed with the family\u2019s name. The interior walls, painted white, sometimes include images of the gods.\nPottery model house; food laid out in fore-court behind pool. Egypt. 12th Dynasty (1991\u20131802 BC).\nWhile purchasing of goods such as food, drink, oils, clothing and so on regularly takes place along the riverbanks in Thebes, as Deir el-Medina is not on the river many resources need to be carried in. Fresh water is available at communal wells \u2013 which also make great socialising spots \u2013 and designated workers known as \u2018water carriers\u2019 also provide for the village, so you won\u2019t go thirsty. Another option is to hire a donkey for carrying water and other goods though it\u2019s quite expensive \u2013 it costs around 20 deben (a weight unit, usually in metal) to hire a donkey for just a few days. While 1 deben can buy you several loaves of bread, hiring a donkey is not easily affordable for the average workman and could take up almost their entire monthly wages.\nAmennakht\u2019s votive stela. Egypt. Found in Deir el-Medina. Around 1170 BC.\nEntertainment\nThe Opet Festival\nIf you time your trip right, the big religious festivals are wonderful to experience \u2013 with great crowds and vibrant celebrations. The Opet festival takes place during the Nile flood season in the summer and can last around 14 days. The most magnificent feature of this festival involves the ritual journey of a bark (or boat) carrying the sacred image of the god Amun from his shrine at Karnak all the way to Luxor temple. This boat was \u2018made pure with silver\u2026worked with gold throughout.\u2019 according to the text from Amenhotep III\u2019s temple stela.\nStatue in the form of Mutemwia, wife of Thutmose IV and mother of Amenhotep III, in the guise of the goddess Mut, protected by the wings of a vulture and enthroned upon a sacred boat. Egypt. Around 1400 BC.\nMusicians, dancers, and spectators gather to celebrate the journey of the image of Amun-Ra. After various feasts and ritual performances honouring the god, his image returns to Karnak via another ritual journey along the Nile. Luxor is alive with a festive atmosphere throughout this whole event. Ensure that you find a place with the general populace along the riverbanks, as this will give you the best view of the festival proceedings.\nCelebrations for local saints\nIn addition to the gods and the king, Thebans also worship the deified figure of king Amenhotep I, and his mother Ahmose-Nefertari, who lived over 200 years ago.\nThere are various annual celebrations for Amenhotep I and his mother, which include grand feasts and images of the king \u2018appearing\u2019 to the festival goers. You will find that the pleasures of food, drink, and sweet fragrances are important to festival celebrations. Bouquets of flowers are given as offerings, adding sweet smells and bright colour to these joyous occasions.\nShopping\nTheban workshops will provide you with all you could ever desire in terms of local and luxury goods traded from Egypt\u2019s neighbours in Nubia and further afield. After the harvesting season, the Nile is overwhelmed with ships transporting goods to be stored in temple granaries and regular trading vessels that pull up along the riverbanks to sell popular everyday items such as fish.\nDish or plate showing a man punting a boat while a fish swims below. Either Egyptian or Egyptianising (found in Cyprus). 1340\u20131200 BC.\nNo coins are used in Egypt so there\u2019s no currency exchange to worry about, but items are regularly traded \u2013 for instance a cow for a jar of oil \u2013 so on each visit you should be able to find something new.\nPolychrome glass vessel in the form of a \u2018bulti\u2019-fish, common in the Nile. Egypt. 18th Dynasty (1549/1550\u20131292 BC).\nTourists should copy veteran market visitors and ensure that they double check the products carefully before purchasing \u2013 an eagle-eyed buyer of sweet-smelling honey used for divine offerings or for ointment may test the jar to ensure it is not congealed, and baskets with coarse coiling should be inspected for their robustness. For any damaged or faulty items, the sellers are expected to provide alternatives or replacements so you can buy with confidence.\nLimestone wall-painting depicting the activities of jewellery-makers and precious-metal workers. Egypt. Around 1400 BC.\nProduction of wonderful goods can all be found at the market, with skilled craftsmen from well-established workshops whose work is high in demand all across Egypt. The painstaking production of fine jewellery and items of precious metals, as well as the dirt and dust of the potter\u2019s kilns used to create all kinds of pottery creates a lively (and loud), unforgettable atmosphere.\nGreen glazed shabti. Egypt. 26th Dynasty (664\u2013525 BC).\nEgyptians value the importance of preparing for the afterlife, therefore items for their tombs such as coffins, shabtis, and papyri are valuable possessions. They are often inscribed with magical texts to ensure that they reach the afterlife. Thebes is renowned as a place for the production of funerary goods. Many sellers will wish to show you such items and it\u2019s worth bearing in mind their value and the need to politely decline if you are not interested. If you can pay a good price, you may find a willing craftsman to customize such objects for you to your own personal tastes and styles \u2013 you may even dictate your own inscription.\nWooden coffin of Taihuty. Egypt. 21st Dynasty. (1069\u2013945 BC).\nFood and drink\nA wide variety of culinary goods can also be purchased at the markets or bartered from neighbours, with items available from elsewhere in Egypt and further afield. Grain and barley are staples in the Egyptian diet \u2013 bread from emmer wheat and barley is produced in abundance, and you will spot many cylindrical clay ovens baking fresh bread that can be purchased from the street. Make sure to try some sweetened bread, usually made with figs, dates, or honey, for a particularly tasty treat!\nSmall shallow dish, hand-modelled in Nile silt clay, filled with figs. Egypt.\nFruit and vegetables such as figs, dates, celery, garlic, and lentils are also readily available to buy as street-food as well as luxury imported goods such as olive oil. Meat including geese and duck, ox and goat are readily available as well as fish, and would typically be roasted or boiled. However, you won\u2019t often find these being consumed every day but more likely to be reserved for special occasions. You may also spot locals buying food as offerings for their ancestors.\nPainted wooden model of four figures preparing food and beer. Egypt, 6th Dynasty (c. 2345\u20132181 BC).\nBeer is consumed daily in Thebes, produced with barley or emmer, and this is a far more nutritious form of beer than you may expect as the grain content is high in protein. It is common practice for manual labourers to receive part of their payment in beer and other foodstuffs like grain. In addition to being an essential for festivals and celebrations, Egyptian beer is so highly regarded that you may even find it being used to barter for other goods at the marketplace. You can find out how to make Egyptian beer here.\nPottery beer jar. From Esna, Egypt, Second Intermediate Period (1650\u20131550 BC).\nWine (exclusively red wine), is a more of a luxury and is often reserved for special occasions or events, such as banquets and festivals. Wine production takes place primarily in the north (Lower Egypt), but also the western oases such as Kharga, and storage vessels record the location and year of production so you\u2019ll be able to select from a wide range to try.\nThings to know\nForeign Influences\nVisitors to the city shouldn\u2019t feel too out of place. A great number of foreigners have settled in Thebes and throughout Egypt as a result of Ramesses II\u2019s conquests, but long before this inhabitants from areas such as Nubia had been an active part of the Egyptian economy and society. If you fancy staying in Thebes after your visit, several career options for non-Egyptians are open to you \u2013 Syrian peoples are included within temple administrative records as holding important government positions as recorded in the papyrus below.\nPart of the Great Harris papyrus, one of the longest surviving texts from ancient Egypt. 20th Dynasty. 1189\u20131077 BC.\nReligion\nYou will see that for the Egyptians, worship of the gods and reverence for the deceased takes precedence in their architecture, their markets, and their homes. Many locals you meet will have names that incorporate the name of a deity, and in local\u2019s letters to one another the gods are usually evoked through sayings such as: \u2018In life, prosperity, and health in the favour of Amun-Ra!\u2019.\nMany funerary texts also provide beautiful illustrations of their gods, often connected to their desire to reach the afterlife.\nPapyrus from the \u2018Book of the Dead\u2019. Detail showing the god Thoth, here in human form with ibis head and a monster with the head of a crocodile, the forepart of a lion, and the hindquarters of a hippopotamus. Egypt. Around 1250 BC.\nVisitors from abroad are more than welcome, however observing the local practices and piety to the gods will be important during your visit, including obeying the rules about not entering the prohibited spaces of the tombs and temples. Policing of the sacred sites and necropolis areas ensures that tombs remain undisturbed, though there are legal procedures in place should any tombs be found to have been robbed.\nFemale travellers\nThough most jobs within Egyptian society are held by men, women are able to go out in public and engage in business on their own. Women can also own and sell property without a male representative.\nGovernment officials\nIf mingling with government officials such as the vizier, the highest official serving under the Egyptian king, or the Medjay (the local police force), all crucial workers who maintain the peace within Thebes and ensure that everything runs smoothly, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to pay a compliment or two to the king.\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed your trip to ancient Thebes, you can travel back in time to other historical cities covered in this series of blog posts.

The subsequent protests, the explosion of pain, indignation and rage in America and across the world, have brought home how deep the experience of racism is for so many in our societies.\nThe British Museum stands in solidarity with the\u00a0British Black community, with\u00a0the African American community, with\u00a0the Black community\u00a0throughout the world. We are aligned with the spirit\u00a0and soul of Black Lives Matter everywhere.\nWe stand with everyone who is denied equal rights and protection from violence in the fullest sense of these terms. These are challenges that we as a society must address, injustices that must be overcome.\nThe death of George Floyd\u00a0and of many others must sharpen our awareness of how much more we as\u00a0a major public cultural institution need to do in the fight against inequality and discrimination. We need to embrace the fact that diversity of background, thought, ability\u00a0and skills are essential for the success of our Museum. And for the heritage sector as a whole.\nInclusion and diversity are at the heart of our values. We will put our best efforts into making them a reality. We will work to diversify our own staff, listening to conversations such as those at last year\u2019s National Programme conference, held at the Museum, which explored equality and diversity in UK museums. We will broaden the diversity of voices present in the interpretation of objects in the collection \u2013 we\u2019re currently learning a lot from our collaboration in Manchester Museum\u2019s new South Asia gallery project which is driven by community co-curation. We will continue to research, acknowledge and address the colonial history of Britain and its impact on our institution in exhibitions like Collecting Histories and Reimagining Captain Cook: Pacific perspectives from 2019. But there is much more to do. In all this we will need to draw on the support of our many long-standing partnerships \u2013 with community organisations in our home borough of Camden and beyond, and museums in this country and across all continents.\u00a0We will move forward together with them as we listen, learn, and act.\nAnd, though it will take time to realise, the Museum\u2019s developing masterplan project provides a unique generational opportunity to reconsider, rethink and rebalance the display of the collection, introducing greater diversity of collections on display, expanding museum narratives.\u00a0And above all, involving multiple voices.\nIn the midst of this debate, the extraordinary breadth and depth of the collection continues to challenge us to discover our common human past. We must reach out beyond what we already know. We must believe that we can enlarge our sense of ourselves as individuals and as communities.\nShortly before lockdown, the Museum started a series of public debates on the \u2018Era of Reclamation\u2019 led by former Deputy Chair of the Museum\u2019s Trustees, Bonnie Greer. As Bonnie remarks in a blog she published to accompany the series:\nHere, inside the British Museum, a theatre of human connection, reclamation can find the seeds that can begin the process of an even deeper, more profound engagement.\u00a0We need now to see and know that we are the same species, with the same stories.\u00a0And that we have always been in search of what we ultimately are seeking to reclaim: ourselves\nBonnie has also written a blog reflecting on current events which can be seen here.\nWorking with partners and listening to both friends and critics, I hope that we will find the right ways to allow the Museum to better reflect our societies and our complex, contentious and blended histories, and become more than ever a theatre of human connection."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/bonnie-greer-what-we-have-saved-from-the-fire/", "category": "News", "title": "Bonnie Greer: what we have saved from the fire", "author": "Bonnie Greer", "timestamp": "2020-06-03 00:00:00", "text": "6pm, 4 April 1968.\nI was styling my hair in the bathroom mirror.\nThis was when Black girls and women made monthly trips to the hairdressers so that we had hair like Twiggy or Rita Hayworth. This involved a concoction whose base was lye, which rested on the head for an hour. We had all been brought up to endure the pain and there was always the music coming from the radio in the salon and the gossip to distract you from the pain.\nThis always happened at the salon your mother frequented, so the style you got was too old, which made it necessary to re-style at home.\nMaybe I was listening to Motown that warm spring evening and maybe not, I don\u2019t recall.

Dr Martin Luther King Jr. had been shot in Memphis.\nHe was dead.\nI said to myself: \u2018this is it.\u2019 And that was the only comment I made about Dr King\u2019s assassination for over 50 years. I could not listen to his voice for a half century, either.\nTrauma can happen to a person, to a people, to a nation, probably to a continent too.\nIt is inter-generational, and it can be hidden. It is unconscious repetition. You cannot flee from trauma.\nIt has to be faced.\nTrauma is the reason why the murder of Stephen Lawrence, and that he might have had a racial epithet hurled at him as the last thing he ever heard, make it almost impossible for me to look at a picture of his face.\nSo you go through life and time holding this trauma inside you. There are gestures and constellations that can reactivate trauma.\nWe humans, we are fragile.\nHumans.\nI thought that I might make something about reclamation \u2013 the re-claiming of what we have lost, what has been lost, what has been taken. The effect of the loss.\nI thought about my own ancestry. The story and the arc of the enslaved African in the so-called \u2018New World.\u2019 The captured African who became Someone Else.\nMeta Africa.\nBut that journey for me from that evening in the mirror has been long and hard and never-ending. It came back again when I realised that I could not look at the video of the death of George Floyd. I saw this big African American man, muscular, with a confident smile on his face, being handcuffed by four white policemen.\nIn Minneapolis, they have a policy of restraint. They put pressure on the neck. Pin you to the ground. Combine that with the unspoken: we Black people have a higher pain threshold because our ancestors were considered machines. Farm animals. Machines and farm animals were treated better.\nAnd also, as that line in The Godfather goes, \u2018the dark people, they have no souls.\u2019\nBack in the late \u201860s, like now, we burned down our own communities. This was the result of being born and raised and living in a ghetto. Your allotted area is all you have, all that you can safely imagine. All that you can affect. We burned a hundred cities. The parts we lived in mainly.\nThere was no one to talk to us like we needed to hear \u2013 no one to soothe us. \u2018Burn! Baby! Burn!\u2019 my generation insisted.

What have we done in the past?\nThe bacterium Yersinia pestis, or \u2018the Black Death\u2019, arrived from perhaps the Crimea on board an Italian ship from about 1346\u20131353.

It looked wide. It learned to navigate what was called \u2018the ocean sea\u2019. Navigate to Africa. Perhaps to reclaim its humanity through the dehumanisation of others.\nOne of the purposes of the curation, \u2018The Era of Reclamation\u2019, which I am developing in collaboration with the Director of the Museum, Hartwig Fischer, is to look for linkages and the questions that they force on us.\nAn example, what trauma arose from pandemics like the Black Death, from great famines, from climate change? What did humans fashion out of them? What did they make in order to express and heal themselves? What did they pass on to later generations? Did their idea about religion change and what did they create out of this? Did they become bigger as political entities or smaller? Did the position of women change? Did cultural expression change? Did it even survive?\nCan we find, through The Era of Reclamation, something that can help inform and most importantly heal us? And show the resilience of the human spirit. Even now.\nShow that out of all the chains and broken glass and burning bodies and stolen land and just plain grief, that we humans have survived. That we have built something: the continuity of human triumph over trauma. We are doing it.\nEven now. No matter how long it takes.\nHistory demands witnesses. It is essential to be one now, a witness of the past living in the present. It is necessary now to say that I have seen things, felt things done things, been things, am things that are so close to what is happening now. That I have saved some things from the fire.\nWhat use, too, is it to have lived and not be able to say that there is pattern, that there are arcs.\nMuseums hold arcs. They hold them in the people who work there, in the objects, in the scholarship, and in the building itself.\nReclamation becomes an arc in which truth can be discovered. And perhaps, if we are all lucky, trauma healed.\nWe have a window now. It is augmented by social media and all the new technologies at hand. They have their own lives, they morph, they grow.\nYoung people now have a much larger political and cultural palate than my generation ever had. They will prevail.\nWe can reconstruct museums as places in which we can claim more and more of our common humanity, face our common trauma and do one of the things that we do best: tell stories.\nJust as Boccaccio\u2019s people came together in a plague-infested Florence to talk to one another. Talk is a method of healing.\nAs is music.\nI\u2019m listening a lot to the music of that Burning Time, of the entire \u201860s, including We Insist! Max Roach\u2019s Freedom Now Suite. It is a kind of reclamation for me.\nIt enabled me to finally look at those moments leading to the death of George Floyd, yet another African American man being killed by the police. The music helped me face down my own trauma.\nIt has become my reclamation.\nA daughter of a friend asked me to tell her about Martin Luther King.\nI had to listen to his \u2018Mountaintop Speech\u2019, the one he made the night he was assassinated.\nHe said: \u2018I don\u2019t need to get there.\u2019 Because he had made a reclamation himself. He had seen what he called \u2018The Promised Land\u2019 of freedom, of equality, of peace and joy.\nAnd I had seen it too. With the help of a child who had asked me to remember.\nAnd reclaim.\nFor her.\nRead a statement from Director Hartwig Fischer here.\nRead Bonnie Greer\u2019s blog on The Era of Reclamation here and her blog exploring the concept of reclamation through three journeys in her life here."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/virtual-visit-london-landmarks/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Virtual visit: London landmarks", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2020-05-31 00:00:00", "text": "If you\u2019re hankering for a holiday or musing over a mini-break, the Museum\u2019s collection of prints and drawings might be able to help. Explore some of London\u2019s landmarks from the comfort of your own home, and enjoy a spot of virtual sightseeing with us.\nWe\u2019re starting our virtual tour around some of London\u2019s famous sights from the most obvious place \u2013 the Museum, right in the heart of Bloomsbury.\n1. British Museum\nThis drawing from the early 1850s shows the then-new Museum building, and visitors making their way in to see the displays, which then included the national library, and the nation\u2019s natural history collections.\nWe can\u2019t wait to welcome visitors again, but in the meantime, you can find all the ways to explore the Museum from home in this blog. But before we get side-tracked, let\u2019s go down the road to our second destination.\nFrederick Mackenzie (1787\u20131854), View of the British Museum. Watercolour touched with white and graphite, squared for transfer, over a lithograph, 1850\u20131852.\n2. Trafalgar Square\nWe\u2019ve now arrived at one of the many famous London squares \u2013 Trafalgar Square, right in the centre of town.\nThis print shows the then-new National Gallery after it opened in 1838. It was thought positioning the free Gallery in Trafalgar Square would mean that everyone in the capital could get there easily to see the fabulous paintings on display. There are lots of sculptures in the square too \u2013 don\u2019t forget to check out what\u2019s on the Fourth Plinth when you visit. It\u2019s currently a sculpture by Michael Rakowtiz inspired by one of the monumental lamassu that once guarded the city of Nineveh in ancient Assyria.\nWilliam Wallis (1796\u20131830 fl.), The New National Gallery. Steel engraving, c. 1830.\n3. London Zoo\nHead north and take a stroll through the beautiful Regent\u2019s Park to find London Zoo, which first opened to the public in 1828.\nYou can still expect to see giraffes here, like in the print below from 1837, but elephants no longer live in the park.\nThis colour aquatint and etching is more focused on the fashionably dressed visitors than the animals, but if you look closely you might spot a peacock that\u2019s the same size as what looks like a zebra!\nColour aquatint and etching, 1837. Published by Benjamin Read.\n4. Buckingham Palace\nThe next stop is the royal residence of Buckingham Palace, shown here in an 1852 lithograph.\nBuckingham Palace has been the home of the monarch since Queen Victoria moved there in 1837, and has an astonishing 775 rooms. The frontage, shown in this lithograph print, measures 108 metres long!\nIf you have time, stick around to see the Changing the Guard ceremony before we visit our next landmark.\nEdmund Walker (1850\u20131856 fl.), Buckingham Palace. Lithograph printed in black, ochre and grey, 1852.\n5. \u2018Big Ben\u2019\nAs we wander down Birdcage Walk, you\u2019ll see the Palace of Westminster \u2013 the home of the British government which encompasses both Houses of Parliament, as well as other buildings dating back hundreds of years.\n\nBig Ben is the name commonly used to describe the clocktower, shown here in an 1858 print with scaffolding around the top just like today. But the title was initially given to the Great Bell inside the tower, which was first struck on 7 September 1859. Each year, the minute hands of the clock face travel a huge 190km, and each weighs over 100kg.\nVacher & Son (1834\u2013fl.), New Palace of Westminster. Lithograph printed with beige tone plate, 1858.\n6. Covent Garden\nFor some retail therapy or light refreshments, the next stop on our virtual visit is Covent Garden \u2013 the home of London\u2019s most famous market.\nOriginally a scattering of stalls in a smart residential area, the market grew, attracting more and more stalls and wooden shelters \u2013 shown in this 1825 watercolour by George Scharf \u2013 until in 1828 Charles Fowler designed the new market, which still stands today.\nWhen the market was first formalised by the 5th Earl of Bedford, only fruit, flowers, roots and herbs could be sold. Now you can find independent traders alongside designer brands and coffee shops.\nGeorge Scharf (1788\u20131860), Old Covent Garden Market. Watercolour, 1825.\n7. St Paul\u2019s Cathedral\nSoaring above London\u2019s skyline to the east is the iconic dome of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. The building we recognise today was redesigned by Sir Christopher Wren and completed in 1708.\nThe Cathedral has long been the home of state funerals and royal jubilees, and as you wander down the Nave, remember to gaze up to the great dome measuring 111 metres high. It was also the tallest building in London until 1967!\nIf you climb the 257 steps from the Cathedral floor you will find the Whispering Gallery, which gets its name from a charming quirk in its construction \u2013 a message whispered against the walls of the gallery will be perfectly audible on the opposite side of the dome. This view of the famous landmark was made in 1848.\nAfter Thomas Hosmer Shepherd (1793\u20131864), View of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. Steel engraving, 1848.\n8. The Tower of London\nAs we head east along the River Thames, we arrive at an imposing sight \u2013 the Tower of London, which has loomed over this part of the city for over 1,000 years. Throughout its history it has been used as a fortress, a palace and a prison \u2013 nowadays it\u2019s famous for holding the Crown Jewels, for its well-dressed Yeoman Warders and its seven ravens. Legend has it that if the ravens leave the Tower, both it and the kingdom will fall.\nThis sunny watercolour shows the north west side of the White Tower in 1784.\nFrancis Grose (c. 1731\u20131791), White Tower of Tower of London. Watercolour, 1784.\n9. Tower Bridge\nSpin round from the Tower, and you\u2019ll set eyes on the majestic Tower Bridge \u2013 a landmark on the Thames for over 125 years. When the bridge was first built, the river was still a working thoroughfare for a huge variety of water traffic, so having a crossing that wouldn\u2019t disrupt the flow of boats was a priority. Hence the sophisticated design for movable roadways, originally powered by steam.\nIn this view from 1920, we\u2019ve crossed over the bridge (just in time to see the road section being raised!), and you can see the Tower of London in the background.\nAlexander Joseph Finberg (1866\u20131939), Tower Bridge, The Outward Bound. Etching with some surface tone, 1920.\nAfter all that sightseeing we\u2019re knackered! It\u2019s definitely time to stop for a cup of tea.\nWe hope you enjoyed this tour around some London landmarks \u2013 where would you like to go next time?

Being sheltered on all sides by mountains, the city has a pleasant climate with hot and dry summers and mild winters. Though a few miles from the sea, it is well-connected to its busy harbour, Piraeus.\nFictive view of Classical Athens.\nThomas de Thomon, Reste d\u2019une partie de la fameuse Ville d\u2019Athenes d\u2019ou l\u2019on voit le Temple de Thes\u00e9e, 1790\u20131800. Etching.\nBoth land and sea are vital to Athens\u2019 economy. Attica \u2013 where the Athenians have their farms and where two thirds of Athenians live \u2013 provides grain, olives and vines, figs, nuts and other fruit and vegetables.\nFarmers sowing and ploughing. Athenian black-figure drinking-cup, attributed to the Burgon Painter, about 550 BC.\nThe most important products the Attic land itself provides are olive oil and silver. In the silver mines of Laurion slaves mine the precious ore from which Athens mints its coins, considered the most solid currency of the Greek world. Athenian olive oil is also famed the world over. Olive groves sacred to the city\u2019s patron goddess, Athena, also provide the oil that is given as the prize at the city\u2019s Panathenaic Games.\nOlive harvest in the countryside. Athenian black-figure amphora attributed to the Antimenes Painter, around 520 BC.\nTravel\nArrival\nA merchant ship with sails and a long and narrow war ship, possibly a pirate ship preparing to attack the merchant vessel. Athenian black-figure drinking cup, about 520\u2013500 BC.\nMost visitors to Athens arrive by sea. Athens\u2019 port, Piraeus, has much grown over recent decades to become a bustling international town that is well worth a visit in its own right (see below). Here the visitor can change foreign currency into Athenian silver coins.\nA view of the bay of the island of Salamis and the city port of Piraeus.\nWilliam Simpson, Bay of Salamis and Piraeus from Xerxes\u2019 seat. 1880. Watercolour, strengthened with gum, over graphite.\nThe road to Athens is a busy thoroughfare, and visitors will have to fight their way through the heavy traffic of people and goods between the port and the city. Those with lots of luggage may wish to hire a mule or cart. The road, though, is safe to travel, being flanked by the famous \u2018long walls\u2019, part of the big fortifications the Athenians erected to protect their city and harbour following the catastrophic sack of Athens in the great war against Persia.\nAthenian silver coin (tetradrachm), 2nd half of the 5th century BC.\nIn the city walls, over a dozen major gates open to roads that give access to the countryside beyond. It is through these gates that travellers approaching the city overland will enter.\nGetting around\nAthens is a city best explored on foot, and visitors should do as locals do and walk. Having grown naturally over its long history, Athens has a maze of irregular streets that follow the natural terrain, many of them narrow unpaved alleyways.\nBenjamin Pouncy. After Richard Wilson. Athens in its Flourishing State.\nView of a classical temple, with a group in the foreground sacrificing a bull. Illustration to Willett\u2019s A Description of the Library at Merly. Etching and engraving. Around 1785.\nA key thoroughfare and point of orientation is the broad Panathenaic way that leads from the Sacred Gate up to the Acropolis, crossing the large market square at the heart of the city. Branching off here to the left, along the busy Street of the Tripods (lined by monuments erected by the victors in the city\u2019s Panathenaic Games), you will reach the far side of the Acropolis with its Theatre of Dionysus and other festival buildings. Branching off right will lead you to the hill of the Pnyx, where the Athenian citizens hold their democratic assembly.\nThings to do\nJohn Bailey (1750\u20131819), View of the Parthenon from the Propylea. Hand-coloured aquatint after Edward Dodwell, 1819.\nAcropolis\nAs a city governed by the people, Athens lacks the palaces of rulers that you find in many other countries and the houses of its citizens are generally simple. However, the city is rightly famous for its splendid temples, statues and public buildings, which few other cities in Greece can match. The undisputed jewel in the city\u2019s crown, and the one sight a visitor is not to miss, is the Acropolis, or \u2018high city\u2019.\nA reconstruction of how the Acropolis may have looked in ancient times, including the Parthenon. Illustration by Kate Morton.\nThe large rocky plateau that rises from the town is said to have carried a king\u2019s palace in the old days of the great heroes. Today though it is the preserve of the gods, being sacred to Athena, the patron deity of Athens, goddess of war and wisdom, and carries her splendid temples.\nMore than any other place in Athens the Acropolis embodies the spectacular rebirth of the city after Persian troops under King Xerxes had sacked and pillaged the city (480 BC). Following their ultimate victory, the Athenians decided to leave the ruined temples on the Acropolis untouched as a memorial to the barbarians\u2019 impiety. It was not until some 30 years later that they began a huge new building programme, the brainchild of the prominent and influential statesman Pericles.\nMarble portrait bust of Pericles. A Roman copy of an earlier Greek original. The name is inscribed in Greek. 2nd century AD.\nAs you pass through the gates of the Acropolis, don\u2019t be surprised by the extent to which monuments and dedications clutter every available space \u2013 all speak to the importance this sacred rock. The most impressive is undoubtedly the colossal bronze statue of a fully armed Athena that celebrates Athens\u2019 victory over Persia. The statue is one of many works by the famous Athenian sculptor Pheidias, responsible also for the sculptural decoration of the Parthenon, the large temple you will see just behind the statue.\nEngraving showing Pericles (seated) reviewing plans for the Propylaea (monumental gateway) on the Acropolis. William Sharp after James Stuart from Ralph Willett, \u2018A Description of the Library at Merly in the county of Dorset\u2019 (London, 1785).\nRichly sculpted and brightly painted, the Parthenon is a masterpiece of architecture, one of the largest ever built in Greece and the centrepiece of the building programme. Its sculptural decoration depicts myths and events relating to the city and its goddess, most notably, in the frieze behind the colonnade, a colourful sacred procession of Athenians and sacrificial animals.\nA cow being led for sacrifice. (Block XLIV) from the South frieze of the Parthenon. 438\u2013432 BC.\nDon\u2019t forget to catch a glance of the temple\u2019s interior, or you will miss out on the most astonishing sight. Though only visible on most days through grilles in the door, in the temple\u2019s eastern chamber stands the most elaborate of all of Pheidias\u2019 statues of Athena, made from gold and ivory. Gleaming brightly in the dim interior, it is said to have cost the extraordinary sum of about 800 talents, more expensive even than building the temple itself\nReplica of the Athena Parthenon statue in Nashville by Alan Le Quire.

Photo: Dean Dixon.\nPnyx \u2013 the Athenian assembly\nThe hill Athenians call the Pnyx offers good views over the city, but its main attraction is that it is the place to watch Athenian democracy at work. Every ten days or so Athenian citizens (that is, men from Athenian families \u2013 women, resident foreigners or slaves are excluded) assemble here to debate and decide on the fortunes of their city. Don\u2019t imagine these to be sombre and dignified gatherings, though. As they tuck into the bread and wine they have brought for sustenance, farmers and city-dwellers, rich and poor, and cobblers and generals alike all hold forth on current affairs while trading witty remarks and insult.\nAll citizens are allowed to speak and vote, though it is often skilled orators backed by family fortunes who achieve the greatest prominence. It is well worth watching a debate and seeing with what skill and eloquence Athenian orators are able to sway the masses.\nAgora \u2013 the marketplace\nNo visit to Athens is complete without a visit to its central marketplace, the Agora, the town\u2019s civic and commercial centre \u2013 and indeed also its geographic centre, as the Altar of the Twelve Gods serves as the central milestone of the city. In no other place can you watch citizens and foreigners, slave girls and market women, rich noblemen and penniless philosophers mix and mingle, for politics, worship, commerce, or gossip, and indeed nothing will bring you closer to the heart of Athenian life than when you haggle with a fishmonger, get into a dispute with a philosopher, or join the crowd of idle young men who hang out in the perfumer-sellers corner.\nDetail from a red figure kylix (cup) showing a cobbler at work making shoes. 480\u2013470 BC.\nThe central space of the Agora on most days is taken up by market tables, booths or carts, from which vendors offer everything and anything anyone could ever desire \u2013 from bread and figs to garlands and wine, cloaks and perfumes, dining couches and slaves. Athenian shop holders, however, have a reputation for cheating on tourists, so visitors should remember that the Athenian market overseers hold an official set of weights and measures in the Tholos.\nGymnasia\nTo exercise both mind and body, visit a gymnasium. First established more than a century ago as places for young men to take military and athletic exercise, gymnasia have developed into centres of learning, where teachers offer philosophical discussions and instruction in subjects ranging from mathematics and astronomy to zoology, botany, logic and rhetoric. They have also become popular places for men to meet to develop homosexual relationships.\nThere are three great gymnasia: the Lyceum, the Kynosarges, and the most famous of all, the Academy.\nTraining in the palaistra (wrestling school). Two youths practice boxing while a trainer is about to hit two wrestlers who have got carried away \u2013 eye-gouging was one of the few things that was actually forbidden. Athenian red-figure drinking cup, attributed to the Foundry Painter, 490\u2013480 BC.\nAlas, no similar facilities are available to women, unless you count the professional training schools for courtesans that instruct in dance, song and music and that enjoy a high reputation. For intellectual debate, Athenian women resort to meeting in private houses. Best known is the salon kept by Aspasia, the former mistress of the great statesman Pericles.\nTwo young girls receive a dancing lesson. Athenian hydria (water-jar). Around 430 BC.\nBaths\nFor those tired of sightseeing, debating and shopping, Athens offers some good recreational facilities. Weary travellers will be glad to soak their tired limbs in one of the city\u2019s public bath suites, located mostly outside the city walls. The baths outside the Dipylon Gate are particularly nice, with a pebble-mosaic floor and bathtubs supplied with hot water from a nearby cistern and furnace, but the baths of Diochares and Isthmonikos generally receive good reviews.\nShopping\nWith goods from across the Mediterranean world on offer, it is difficult to choose what to bring home from Athens. Popular are local specialities, such as Attic honey or olive oil, or imported spices such as North African silphium. Nor can one go wrong with a bottle of perfume, exotic imports from Egypt such as cinnamon scent, or the Athenian Panathenaikon, sold in miniature bottles imitating the large Panathenaic prize amphorae. Intellectuals will appreciate scrolls with the latest works of Athenian playwrights or philosophers. For those with space in their luggage, a set of exquisitely painted Athenian pottery is a must.\nPanathenaic prize amphorae (olive oil jar) showing the goddess Athena. 425\u2013400 BC.\nEntertainment\nNo other city in Greece has as much to offer in terms of entertainment and comforts of life. The best way to enjoy Athens is to visit during a major religious festival, when the whole city comes together to celebrate, and spectacles and competitions are staged that have their equal in few other corners of the known world. With some religious festival or other taking place on average every three days, visitors stand a good chance to catch some of the fun.\nAthenian marble relief with the goddess Bendis receiving a procession of worshippers. 400\u2013375 BC.\nThe main city festival is the Panathenaia, celebrated every year in the summer on the birthday of Athena. But it is only every four years that it features the spectacular games for which the best athletes, musicians and numerous spectators flock to Athens from all over the Greek world.\nFor five days there are public competitions in music, in reciting Homer\u2019s poetry, in gymnastic and in equestrian contests, including boxing, wrestling, pentathlon, footraces, horse-races and chariot-races. There are also events such as dancing in armour, torch races, a regatta in the harbour, and even a male beauty pageant called euandria.\nRed-figure Panathenaic ampora, showing two boys horse racing. Around 500\u2013490 BC.\nThe other great festival is the Great Dionysia, celebrated every spring \u2013 though to participate in this requires some stamina. After a lively procession, sacrifice and much revelry, dancing and drinking as befits a festival for Dionysus, god of wine and debauchery, there follows the highlight of the festival, as the audience settles into an open-air theatre set into the Acropolis hill for several days of watching performances put on by the greatest of Greek playwrights.\nAn Athenian terracotta figure of a comic actor playing the part of a young woman. About 350 BC.\nAnd if large crowds and bawdy jokes are not your cup of tea, there are also numerous smaller festivals where visitors may catch a glimpse of local rites or be invited to join the feasting. Of late these even include festivals to deities such as Egyptian Isis or Thracian Bendis, introduced by resident foreigners, or the peculiar Adonia, where Athenian women loudly wail on their rooftops in lament for the death of the Phrygian god Adonis.\nWhere to stay\nBoth the city and its port, Piraeus, offer lodgings for travellers at inns or taverns. For most tourists, Athens will be the first choice, though for those with business to conduct in shipping or sea trade, Piraeus will also be a good option. For those arriving from a city or country that has an honorary consul, a proxenos, in town, he should be the first point of call as it will be his business to assist and look after the interests of any visitors. If you cannot call on such services or prefer to make your own arrangements, here is what you need to know about the different parts of town.\nAn Athenian kylix (drinking cup) showing a youth surrounded by four large oared ships and dolphins. 510\u2013500 BC.\nAthens has a population of some 100,000 actually living in the city, and twice that in the Attic countryside. Not surprising, then, that the city may seem crowded, noisy and polluted. Inside the city walls is especially densely built up, notably so in the residential districts of Koile and Melite, towards the Pnyx. Leafier areas are found in the residential quarters just outside the city walls and along the three rivers that cross the city, Cephissus, Ilissos and Eridanos. Kolonos, close to the park and exercise grounds of the Academy, is a pleasant district that is best-known for being the home of the playwright Sophocles. Probably the most upmarket districts is Alopeke, south-east of the city walls, home to millionaires such as Kallias, one of the richest men of Greece notorious for his lavish life-style.\nThose looking for a more bohemian flair may be attracted by areas around the city gates. Many have a reputation as red-light districts and are popular with young men in search of a good time. A lively area with workshops in which philosophers and other idlers mix and mingle is also found on the fringes of the Agora, where sculptors, marble workers, iron and bronze workers, bone workers and cobblers, as well as some potters and terracotta figurine makers, have settled.\nAthenian black-figure oenochoe (wine jug) depicting a metal workshop with two men working at a furnace. 500\u2013475 BC.\nPiraeus is the port of Athens and one of the largest ports of Greece, served by three harbours. Under Pericles some decades ago the town was rebuilt and has since exploded in size. Piraeus today is far more than just an appendix to Athens \u2013 it is a densely populated town with a cosmopolitan flair thanks to the foreigners, from Egyptians and Thracians to Phoenicians and Syrians, who have made it their home. Bustling with sailors and merchants, Piraeus has a reputation for good but simple taverns and a wide selection of brothels.\nFood and drink\nA red figure fish plate showing a red mullet, sea-perch or bass, small torpedo, sargus, and a cuttle-fish. Made in Campania, 360\u2013330 BC.\nAthenians love to eat well, and travellers will not go hungry. Across town a wide range of establishments, from carts selling drink to well-regarded taverns such the \u2018Bald Man\u2019 kept by Kallias and Thraitta, serve wine and food and are much frequented by locals. In terms of food there is something to suit every taste and pocket. Visitors will be glad to find plentiful and decent supplies of bread and cheese, to be spiced up with garlic and onions, as well as lentil soup or cooked bulbs to keep them going throughout the day. For variety, small-fry fresh from the sea or sausages are widely available.\nTerracotta figure of a woman grinding grain. 5th century BC.\nSpecialities not to miss include tuna (imported from the Black Sea) in cheese and garlic sauce, tender roasted birds sprinkled with olive oil and grated silphion, or pig\u2019s belly and sow\u2019s matrix, seasoned with cumin, vinegar and silphion. Be sure to also sample Athenian cakes \u2013 the Athenian cheesecake considered second to none!\nA selection of cooking pots. 500\u2013400 BC.\nFine dining\nThe Athenians have perfected to an art the traditional Greek symposium, or drinking party, where dinner is followed by more drinks over cakes and nibbles. An invitation to a private symposium is the surest way to experience Athenian feasting at its best.\nAthenian stamnos (storage jar) showing men at a symposion, one of them sings while a woman plays the double pipes, another swings his cup by the handle, preparing to play kottabos. 450\u2013440 BC.\nPrivate symposia are usually small, with three to seven comfortable couches on which two diners each can recline. Even if guests will often contribute a prepared dish from home (fear not, this will not be expected of a traveller), your host will have hired a cook and probably some additional serving staff.\nAn Athenian drinking cup showing a dancing girl performing at a symposion, while a diner, reclines a couch. 490\u2013480 BC.\nProfessional female entertainers such as dancers, flute players and acrobats will have been invited, and they are likely to be available for more intimate entertainment as the evening wears on. Expect conversation to be lively and be prepared to perform bawdy ballads, to debate the latest scandals in Athenian politics, and especially to play kottabos, a popular but exceedingly tricky party game that has diners compete in flicking dregs from their wine cups at a target. Later on in the evening you may find that revellers from other parties gate crash your dinner, or that your party in turn takes to the road to continue revelling in the street \u2013 this is quite common and generally tolerated, as long as party-goers refrain from serious vandalism and sacrilegious acts.\nDrinking\n\u2018Drink\u2019 in Athens means wine, which Athenians drink frequently and in some quantity. Stalls and taverns sell wine in bulk, but also by the cup, and will serve anything from the cheap and simple local wines to the highly regarded imports from Mende, Magnesia, Thasos or Chios.\nThe rowdy end to a symposion. Athenian drinking cup. 490\u2013480 BC.\nWhile visitors need to take care not to fall prey to unscrupulous landlords who overly dilute their wines, it is important to remember that some dilution is indeed the norm in Athens: like other Greeks, Athenians, too, will drink their wine only mixed with water, with the mixing bowl \u2013 the krater \u2013 forming the centre of any symposium. Drinking wine neat is considered just as barbarian as drinking beer and will immediately disqualify any foreigner\nLocal customs\nThings to know\nAthenians welcome visitors, and with many of the city\u2019s residents and slaves coming from abroad, plus numerous passing traders and diplomats, locals are well used to (and generally tolerant of) even the strangest foreign customs. Nonetheless, Athenians are also proud and protective of their own privileges, and so some events and spaces, including some sanctuaries and festivals, are reserved for citizens alone, and unless invited by locals visitors should respect such restrictions. Special care to adhere to rules should be taken also in the religious sphere (see below).\nA bronze juror\u2019s ticket inscribed with the name of his owner, \u2018Aristophon, son of Aristodemos\u2019. Jurors were chosen by lot from among the citizens. 4th century BC.\nFor women travellers Athens may present some inconvenience, as to most Athenian men a respectable wife\u2019s place is in the home, far from the gaze of any man, and men generally consider themselves superior and naturally privileged. This means that a travelling couple is likely to have to dine separately when invited to an Athenian\u2019s house, and that also the best food and entertainment is reserved for men. Nonetheless, women are able to move around town freely. While some spaces (such as certain sanctuaries, or gymnasia where men exercise) may be barred to women, most attractions, including splendid theatre festival at the City Dionysia, are accessible, and there is feasting in women-only festivals just as much as in men\u2019s.\nFor Athenian men, a wife\u2019s place was in the home.

More of a problem may be fraud, as prostitutes, shop-owners or landlords are known to try and cheat unsuspecting tourists out of their hard-earned cash, though vigilance is all that can be recommended here.\nDetail of painting from red figure cup showing a woman in an interior setting. 480\u2013470 BC.\nGiven Athenians\u2019 views on women, male visitors should take care before approaching a citizen\u2019s wife or daughter, as well as avoid getting into arguments with drunk revellers (many of whom will be sons of influential politicians), and refrain from causing any damages to an Athenian\u2019s life or property. While all this is sensible in any foreign place, it is so even more in Athens, as Athenians are notorious litigious.\nReligion\nTo visitors from other parts of the Greek world will find Athenian religious customs will look familiar enough, but also visiting foreigners should encounter few problems. Athenians are tolerant of all foreign religion, but will expect visitors to adhere to basic rules, especially within sanctuaries. Special sanctuary rules are often publicly displayed, but it is useful to remember that generally it is not allowed to remove anything from a sacred precinct, so don\u2019t be tempted to walk off with a \u2018souvenir\u2019!\nBlack figure vase showing meat from a sacrifice to the god Hermes (represented by a statue on the right), being cooked on a fire. 520\u2013510 BC.\nWe hope you enjoyed your visit to Classical Athens!\nIn the mood for more time travelling?

It is by far the largest city in Japan, and, although few of its residents know it, one of the largest cities in the world. Founded as a fortified castle town in the late 1500s by the samurai general Tokugawa Ieyasu, during its more than 200 years of history, Edo has evolved into a diverse metropolis accommodating samurai administrators, farmers, artisans, tradesmen, and the wealthy merchants whose gleaming white storehouses line the Sumida River, the main river flowing north-south through the city.\nThe city stands on the southern edge of the vast Kant\u014d Plain and fronts Edo Bay (Edo-mae). It has no natural defences, so a spiralling network of canals was constructed around the castle as a kind of protective moat. Today Edo has reached the height of its prosperity in a period of peace, and these waterways function as a transportation network delivering produce and manufactured goods from every region of Japan.\nPublished by Nishimuraya Yohachi (1762\u20131835), map of Edo. Hanging scroll, woodblock print, 1785.\nAside from the castle, buildings in Edo rise no higher than two storeys, so from many neighbourhoods, but especially from the crests of hills and along the east-west canals, Mount Fuji is often visible low on the western horizon.\nWhen to visit\nOver the course of a year, Edo experiences the range of seasonal conditions that you might expect of a temperate climate \u2013 balmy springs, baking hot summers, mellow autumns and biting cold winters. Like the rest of Japan, Edo also has a summer rainy season (tsuyu) when, for around four weeks, rain is a constant, and everything stays at least damp if not entirely drenched. Try to avoid this time of year!\nIn the East Asian calendar, the months are numbered 1\u20133 for spring, 4\u20136 for summer, 7\u20139 for autumn, and 10\u201312 for winter. The calendar in use in the 1830s follows a lunar cycle that starts about a month later than the Western calendar. For example, New Year\u2019s Day is the first day of the first month but falls during the Western equivalent of February. Remembering this difference will help you to schedule around the rainy season in the 5th month (corresponding to June), and keep you from arriving at annual events (or your hotel) a month early.\nGetting there\nUtagawa Hiroshige (1797\u20131858), No 16 Yoshiwara, hidari Fuji (Yoshiwara: Fuji on the Left) from the series Fifty-Three Stations of the Tokaido Highway. Colour woodblock print, 1833\u20131834.\nMost visitors reach Edo on foot, travelling along one of the country\u2019s five major highways. The most famous is the Eastern Sea Road (T\u014dkaid\u014d), which runs for 500 kilometres between Edo and Kyoto. It is among the best maintained highways in the world. Its 53 main stations and numerous intermediate stations are equipped with a variety of inns, restaurants and stables. Large cryptomeria trees planted at regular intervals provide shade, and wheeled vehicles are prohibited, so the road\u2019s surface is usually smooth.\nGetting around\nMaruyama-Shijo School, empty sedan chair, (kago) under a full autumn moon. Surimono; colour woodblock print, 1856.\nWalking is the best way to get around the city. You will be able to move at your own pace and explore the sights or areas that interest you. High ranking samurai travel the city in ornate sedan chairs but Sedan chairs (kago), consisting of a cloth sling or a cushioned frame suspended from a pole, can be rented for excursions outside the city.\nAttributed to Utagawa Hiroshige III (1842\u20131894), two women under flowering cherry tree by the Sumida River, Senso-ji on far bank and Mt. Fuji in the distance. Hanging scroll painting, 1865\u20131894.\nA number of Edo\u2019s sights are located along the Sumida River. The wide embankments on both sides are planted with cherry trees and make for pleasant walking, particularly on spring and summer evenings. Large wooden bridges cross the river at various points, and there are many ferries. You can also travel up and down river via water taxi (ch\u014dkibune), a small boat that carries around three passengers. Larger groups of six or seven people might consider hiring a covered pleasure boat (yakatabune) for the day or evening.\nEishosai Choki (1781\u20131813, c. active), a large pleasure barge, possibly belonging to Takashimaya tea-house carving its way through boats on the Sumida. Colour woodblock triptych print, c. 1781\u20131813.\nThings to see and do\nAsakusa Temple\nTorii Kiyonaga (1752\u20131815), Sensoji no seiran (Clearing Skies over Sensoji (Asakusa Temple)) from the series Edo hakkei (Eight Views of Edo). Colour woodblock print c. 1781.\nWhether you are staying for several months or a few days, Edo has something to accommodate every taste and interest, ranging from Confucian study groups to the earthy entertainments available in the theatre and brothel districts. Some visitors may hope to catch a glimpse of life behind the walls of Edo Castle, but this heavily guarded compound is off-limits to the public. No matter, though, as there is plenty else to see. One place to start might be Asakusa Temple, formally called Sens\u014d-ji, a Buddhist temple dedicated to the Goddess of Mercy (Kannon in Japanese, or Avalokitesvara in Sanskrit). The avenue between the main gate and the worship hall is a sight in itself, with stands and vendors offering religious amulets, local snacks, and popular souvenirs such as bamboo toothbrushes. The streets around the temple (okuyama) present a range of amusements, sideshows, curiosities, and restaurants.\nSans\u014d Hall\nUtagawa Hiroshige (1797\u20131858), Gohyaku Rakan Sazaido (The Five Hundred Rakan Nautilus Hall) from the series Toto Meisho (Famous Places of the Eastern Capital). Colour woodblock print, c. 1833\u20131838.\nFor views of the city and Mount Fuji, try the balcony of the Sans\u014d Hall (also called the Sazae or Sazai Hall) at the Temple of Five-hundred Arhats (Gohyaku-rakan-ji). One spiral staircase takes you to the top of this unique three-story building, and a different spiral staircase leads you down, so visitor traffic flows smoothly.\nShopping\nUtagawa Hiroshige (1797\u20131858), No 44 Nihon-bashi-dori from the series Meisho Edo Hyakkei\u00a0(One\u00a0Hundred\u00a0Famous\u00a0Views\u00a0of\u00a0Edo). Colour woodblock print, 1858.\nTo find the latest in Edo fashion, head to the textile emporiums of Shirokiya and Echigoya, located in Tori-cho, one of the city\u2019s finest shopping districts, near Nihonbashi, Other places of interest include Nihonbashi\u2019s celebrated fish market; Susaki, at the southwest edge of the city, for worshipping the sunrise on New Year\u2019s Day; Ueno for cherry blossoms in springtime, although the less crowded Mt. Asuka and Mt. Goten have equally beautiful displays; and the areas surrounding Ry\u014dgoku Bridge on both sides of the Sumida River, which are known for fine restaurants with views of the fireworks in summer.\nArt and culture\nMultiple print artists, Maruyama-Shijo School, Tokaido meisho zue (Pictorial Guide to Famous Places on the Tokaido). Woodblock illustrated book, 1797.\nIf your interest is colour woodblock prints and the latest instalments of best-selling illustrated novels, visit the bookshops lining the last section of the T\u014dkaid\u014d Highway as you enter the city, the neighbourhood of Shiba. Here you can browse the stacks of brightly coloured prints designed by artists such as Katsushika Hokusai, Utagawa Hiroshige, Utagawa Kuniyoshi and Utagawa Kunisada among many others. Their subjects range from landscapes and warriors, to Kabuki actors and high-ranking courtesans and their works are surprisingly cheap \u2013 you can pick up a nice print for the price of two bowls of noodles. The first few prints in Hokusai\u2019s hit series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji are now available, although some designs like Under the Wave off Kanagawa (Ed. later known as the Great Wave) are in such high demand, that examples from the first printing may already be scarce.\nKatsushika Hokusai (1760\u20131849), Kanagawa oki nami ura (Under the Wave off Kanagawa) from the series Fugaku sanj\u016brokkei (Thirty-six Views of Mt. Fuji). Colour woodblock print, 1831.\nEntertainment\nThe residents of Japan\u2019s other large urban centres might disagree, but as far as the proud locals and many visitors are concerned, Edo is the entertainment capital of Japan. Even high-ranking samurai trained in the Confucian classics and burdened with the responsibilities of leadership cannot resist the pull of Edo\u2019s pleasure quarters.\nLeft: Utagawa Kunisada (1786\u20131864), Kan Shojo from the series Oatari kyogen. Woodblock print, 1814 . Right: Utagawa Kunisada (1786\u20131864), Iwai Kumesabur\u014d II as Yaoya Oshichi. Colour woodblock print, 1832.\nThe two most famous areas are Yoshiwara, the government-authorized brothel district where high-ranking courtesans charm their way into the purses of their wealthy clientele, and the theatre district, where the stars of the Kabuki theatre entertain the general public with historical dramas and scenes of contemporary romance. Kabuki performances start early in the morning and last for most of the day, with individual plays sometimes continuing for ten or more acts. The leading men (tachiyaku) and the men who specialize in women\u2019s roles (onnagata) have perfected their art over many years and sometimes over several generations. Celebrated performers include the leading actor Ichikawa Danj\u016br\u014d VII and the onnagata Iwai Kumesabur\u014d II (later Hanshir\u014d VI).\nUtagawa Kunihisa (active 1801\u20131818), group of geishas and young attendant playing musical instruments. Hanging scroll painting, 1801\u20131818.\nFor a more relaxed entertainment environment, head to the unlicensed pleasure districts, such as Fukagawa in the southeast corner of the city, where geisha (professional musicians and dancers) will perform their beguiling versions of popular ballads and tunes from the Kabuki theatre. Their instrument of choice is the three-stringed samisen, which has a twanging sound similar to a banjo. You will hear this instrument being played across the city, in both restaurants and private homes, as the daughters of wealthy merchants have also taken an interest in it, much to their parents\u2019 chagrin.\nWhere to stay\nUtagawa Hiroshige (1797\u20131858), No 86, Yotsuya Naito Shinjuku from the series Meisho Edo Hyakkei (One Hundred Famous Views of Edo). Colour woodblock print, 1857.\nThe immediate vicinity of Edo Castle and the hills to the west are occupied by large samurai estates. A wealthy daimy\u014d might maintain two or more estates throughout the city. These serve as the permanent residence of his wife and children, who by law cannot leave Edo, barring exceptional circumstances. Low-ranking samurai on a year\u2019s tour-of-duty in Edo live in row houses near their lord. The rest of the population is packed into low-lying areas close to the Sumida River. One of Edo\u2019s main hotel districts is Nait\u014d Shinjuku, the next-to-last station on the K\u014dsh\u016b Kaid\u014d highway as you enter the city.\nFood and drink\nEdo ry\u014dri\nUtagawa Hiroshige (1797\u20131858), Kachoga genre \u2013 large fish, katsuo, bonito or skipjack tuna with sprigs of creeping saxifrage, with poems. Colour woodblock print, c. 1832.\nEdo cuisine (Edo ry\u014dri) reflects the tastes of eastern Japan. It includes a high proportion of locally grown vegetables, such as Nerima radishes (daikon) and Japanese mustard spinach (komatsuna). An abundance of fresh fish reaches the city from Edo Bay, including red snapper (tai), flounder (hirame), bonito (katsuo), crayfish (ebi), and many varieties of small shellfish. A prized delicacy is the first bonito catch of the year (hatsu-gatsuo), enjoyed around the beginning of summer (East Asian 4th month, or May in the Western calendar).\nDoj\u014d\nA local specialty is fish stew made with freshwater pond loach (doj\u014d). In the earliest known version of the dish, which may have originated in 1804 at a restaurant near Asakusa, the loach is cooked whole. In a more recent version called Yanagawa (or nuki-nabe), it is filleted along the belly but kept in one piece and cooked with burdock root, and then topped with beaten egg (tamago-toji). This recipe may have originated at a restaurant called Yanagawa sometime in the past decade or so, but other restaurants are also credited with creating it, and there are other explanations for the origin of the name. The stew may also be served over a bed of rice (maiko-don).\nMiso\nA local specialty is Edo sweet miso (Edo ama-miso). Miso\u2019s main ingredients are fermented rice paste (k\u014dji) and soybeans, which may be combined in various proportions. People in western Japan generally prefer the sweet flavour of light-coloured miso, which has a relatively higher proportion of k\u014dji. People in eastern Japan tend to prefer the stronger salty taste of dark-coloured miso, which has a relatively higher proportion of soybeans. Bright red Edo ama-miso takes its flavour mostly from soybeans, but contains less salt, and has a sweeter flavour due to its higher k\u014dji content, compared with other types of eastern miso.\nOther delicacies\nOther favourite foods include: Edo nori (a type of red seaweed), pickled vegetables (tsukemono), dark soy sauce (koi-kuchi sh\u014dy\u016b), tofu, sweets made from melted syrup (often made and sold by street vendors), tempura, rice crackers (senbei), and different kinds of buckwheat noodles (soba).\nFine dining\nEdo is a city of luxury dining. Superior restaurants line the riverbanks around Ry\u014dgoku and populate the neighbourhood around Asakusa. Particularly famous is Yaozen (literally \u2018Yao quality\u2019 dining). When first established near Asakusa sometime around the late 1710s-early 1730s, Yaozen catered to local Buddhist priests, but their clientele has since greatly expanded and they have become known for fine cuisine in general.\nVarious artists, (Edo ry\u016bk\u014d) Ry\u014dri ts\u016b (Popular Edo Cuisine), vol.1. Woodblock-printed book, published 1822\nOver the past decade or so, the fourth generation proprietor Kuriyama Zenshir\u014d has cultivated a reputation as a man of cultural interests. He is so well-connected that his 1822 cookbook, All You Need to Know about Popular Cuisine in Edo (Edo ry\u016bk\u014d ry\u014dri ts\u016b), includes prefaces by the samurai poet and intellectual \u014cta Nanpo and the calligrapher and Confucian scholar Kameda B\u014dsai, along with illustrations by the samurai artist Tani Bunch\u014d and the popular artist Katsushika Hokusai. The second volume appeared in 1825, the third in 1829, and the fourth is expected in 1835, so if you take a fancy to the local cuisine, these are books to look out for.\nDrinks\nFor an alcoholic drink, it\u2019s usually rice wine (sake) which is served at most social occasions. Water is available for tea, but for health reasons, water is best consumed after being boiled.\nLocal customs\nThings to be aware of\nUtagawa Kunisada (1786\u20131864), Ichikawa Danjuro VII as Yuranosuke. Colour woodblock print, 1815.\nThere are a few things to look out for when wandering the streets of Edo. Samurai wear two swords, one long and one short, secured at the waist by a sash (obi). They are the only men allowed to wear two swords, and are therefore easy to recognize from a distance. If you are a samurai walking in the street and happen to encounter a superior, bow low until he passes. Everyone else should bow to every samurai.\nReligion\nAttributed to a follower of Sumiyoshi Gukei (1631\u20131705), scenes of cherry-blossom viewing in spring in Ueno, from Hirokoji (south) to Sanno shrine (north). Handscroll painting, 1716\u20131736.\nEdo has many Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines addressing a range of religious and spiritual needs, and each with a calendar of festivals and ceremonies. One of the largest temples is Kan\u2019eiji, built northeast of Edo Castle along the crest of Ueno Hill as a defence against the evil forces that might attack the castle from the unlucky northeast direction.\nTorii Kiyonaga (1752\u20131815), travellers at Enoshima: Collection of elegantly dressed pilgrim travellers waiting at tea-stall at Katase Beach. Colour woodblock print, c. 1788\u20131789.\nAn important pilgrimage destination is the Benten Shrine on the island of Enoshima, located off the coast southwest of Edo. The only female deity among the Seven Lucky Gods, Benten is associated with music, wisdom, and good fortune. She is also associated with water, and her shrines are often located on islands, or near rivers and waterfalls. She is worshipped in both Buddhist and Shinto contexts, and sometimes in a blending of the two \u2013 a feature of religion common at this time. The fresh sea-air along the coast makes a pleasant change from the hustle-and-bustle of Edo, and many visitors enjoy gathering seashells on Shichirigahama Beach opposite the island. A trip to Enoshima can be combined with a visit to see the ancient capital of Kamakura and its famous bronze Buddha, which sits stoically on a plinth, exposed to the elements.\nWant to continue your voyage of discovery around Japan?

We don\u2019t know a lot about Djedkhonsiu-ef-ankh\u2019s life, but we do know he was a priest in the temple of Amun at Karnak. Here he had two main roles \u2013 one was \u2018Opener of the Doors of Heaven\u2019, which meant he was one of the priests who was entitled to open the doors of the shrine in the temple sanctuary, containing the cult image of the god.\nAfter Djedkhonsiu-ef-ankh died, he was mummified, wrapped in fine linen and sewn into his plaster and linen mummy case. This case was beautifully painted in bright colours and gilded with gold leaf over the face. At the time of his funeral, he was lowered into his coffin, and carried to his tomb. Then several litres of warm black \u2018goo\u2019 were poured all over the mummy case, covering it completely, effectively cementing the case into the coffin. The lid was then placed on the coffin, and he was left to journey forth to the underworld.\nDjedkhonsiu-ef-ankh was not unique. Though not used by everyone \u2013 there are a number of instances of this \u2018black goo\u2019 being used in Egyptian burials. But what is it? And if we find out what it was made from, can we learn more about why the Egyptians used it?\nMummy case and coffin of Djedkhonsiufankh. Egyptian, 22nd Dynasty (945\u2013720 BC). Find out more.\nThere are many texts that deal with spiritual preparations for death in ancient Egypt, but very few texts that deal with practical aspects. Knowledge about the practices around mummification and burial appear to have been restricted. So one of the best ways to learn more about this black goo is to chemically analyse it to find out what it is. We can do this in our science labs hidden underground the museum.\nWhat is \u2018black goo\u2019?\nBritish Museum experts have analysed more than 100 samples of black goo from twelve coffins and mummy cases, all dating to the 22nd Dynasty in the Third Intermediate Period (c. 900\u2013750 BC). To do this, we take tiny samples and conduct a form of chemical analysis called \u2018Gas Chromatography \u2013 Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)\u2019. This involves vaporising each sample and pushing it through a long tube, which separates the molecules in the sample. At the end of the tube, the molecules go into a mass spectrometer which separates them according to their mass to charge ratio. From this we can tell which molecules are present and in what quantities.\nAnalysis of black goo samples in laboratories at the British Museum.\nWe discovered that the goo is made of a combination of plant oil, animal fat, tree resin, beeswax and bitumen \u2013 which is solid crude oil. The exact ingredients vary from one coffin to the next, but the goo was always made from some of these ingredients. It is possible there were other ingredients as well, that we can no longer detect, because they were volatile and evaporated, or have degraded to undetectable levels over the 3,000 years since the goo was applied.\nWhere did the ingredients come from and how were they sourced?\nSome of the products we have identified only naturally occur outside of Egypt, indicating that these were imported. The two tree resins we often find in black goo are pistacia tree resin and conifer tree resin. Tree resin is a liquid that trees produce in response to injury, which hardens to a brittle solid.\nMummy of Djedkhonsiufankh. Egyptian, 22nd Dynasty (945\u2013720 BC). Find out more.\nPistacia trees grow around the Mediterranean, from Greece to Western Asia. Amphorae (pots) that contained resin from pistacia trees have been found at Amarna, the Egyptian royal city from 1347 to 1332 BC, and in the Uluburun shipwreck (off the coast of west Turkey) from approximately the same date. Analysis of the ceramics shows that these pots were most likely made in the region around Haifa in modern Israel, which is probably also where the resin was collected. Pistacia resin was also used as incense in ancient Egypt, and as a golden varnish on painted coffins, so we know it was being imported in reasonable quantities.\nConifer resin may come from a variety of trees, including pine, cedar, fir and juniper, but it\u2019s difficult to distinguish between these resins after so many years. The furthest south that these types of tree grow is Lebanon, which indicates that this resin was also imported into Egypt from somewhere further north. Conifer resin has also been found in jars relating to other ritual or funerary uses, again suggesting it was a common import.\nBitumen is an umbrella term for crude oil products. There are many sources known to have been used in ancient times, some liquid and some solid. Bitumen is made from living things (like plants, animals and single-celled organisms) that have died and been compressed over millions of years. Because these living things vary due to the local environment, bitumen also varies from place to place.\nMummy case with gilded face (cleaned in the 1970s) containing the mummified body of a young girl called Tjayasetimu. The mummy case has been covered in black goo. Egyptian, c. 900 BC. Find out more.\nExamining the remains of these livings things, which we call \u2018biomarkers\u2019, is the key to finding out the source of the bitumen. By comparing the biomarkers in the goo sample to those from known sources, we can see that the bitumen came from the Dead Sea. This makes sense as ancient Greek texts refer to solid blocks of bitumen floating to the surface of the Dead Sea and people rowing out to these to hack pieces off and sell them in Egypt.\nWhat was it used for and why?\nWe can\u2019t say for certain but, significantly, previous analyses of mummification balm (used on the bodies themselves) have shown it to be made of the same ingredients as the black goo that we have been studying on the outside of coffins and mummy cases. This means the black goo was being used at different points in the burial process \u2013 during the preparation of the dead body, and then again during the funeral, on top of the mummy case or coffin.\nAn example of another coffin with \u2018black goo\u2019. Coffin of Padihorpakhered, Milk-bearer of Amun. Egyptian, 22nd Dysnasty (945\u2013720 BC). Find out more.\nWhen someone died, they were said to become a form of the god Osiris, who is associated with death and rebirth. Osiris was called \u2018the black one\u2019 in various funerary texts and is often depicted with black skin and in the guise of a mummified body. Black is also the colour associated with the alluvial silt deposited on the banks of the River Nile after the annual flood receded. Since this fresh and fertile soil provided the ideal environment in which seeds for crops could germinate and grow, it was viewed it as being inherently magical and regenerative. Clay and wooden seed beds in the shape of Osiris, filled with black soil from the Nile and sown with germinating seeds, were sometimes included with the funerary equipment in New Kingdom burials. So, we have interlinking concepts of black, Osiris, and regeneration. It could therefore be reasoned that the practice of coating coffins in black goo links the coffins to regeneration associated with Osiris.\n\nSeated wooden figure with the head in the form of a turtle, from the tomb of Ramesses I or Seti I. The black goo was analysed 20 years ago and found to be made from pistacia tree resin. Egyptian, 19th Dynasty (1292 BC\u20131189 BC) Find out more about this object.\nIn addition to mummy cases, black goo was also painted on funerary statues of deities. There are several examples of this in the British Museum from the tombs of New Kingdom kings from about 1300 BC, including the seated figure pictured below. Many statues from the tomb of Tutankhamun were also covered in black goo, although these examples have not been analysed. Some shabti boxes (boxes used for holding figurines to be left in the tomb of the deceased) were also coated in black goo. So, it appears that the goo was a ritually important anointing fluid used for a range of purposes, all relating to the burial of the deceased and their transformation into Osiris.\nWooden figure of a baboon that has been covered in black goo. Egyptian, 18th Dynasty (1549/1550\u20131292 BC). Find out more.\nBut not everyone got the goo treatment. Evidence suggests that it was likely to have been reserved for social elites. Some of the earliest examples are from royal burials. Tutankhamun\u2019s innermost gold coffin was cemented into the middle coffin with \u2018bucketfulls\u2019 of black goo (since cleaned off). The black goo was also available to non-royals but the family had to be able to afford the treatment. Even among social elites, not everyone had black goo, and it seems to have been a matter of personal choice. Examples of the use of black goo are more common in the Third Intermediate Period (c. 1069 BC\u2013c. 664 BC), which may be related to changes in funerary practices, or because more coffins are preserved from this time.\nKite photograph facing west across the ancient town at Amara West towards Ernetta Island.\nCourtesy of the British Museum Amara West Research Project.\nRecent excavations at the ancient town of Amara West, conducted by the British Museum in collaboration with the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM) in Sudan, have uncovered a crumbly black substance in a tomb dating to the end of the New Kingdom c. 1100 BC. Analysis of this black substance found that it contained oil, wax, pistacia resin, and bitumen, which means that this is an example of black goo. Amara West is in Nubia, an area to the south of Egypt that the Egyptians sought to control because of its gold deposits. This is the first example of black goo being found in Nubia and shows Egyptian funerary rites being used far away from the centre of power in Egypt.\nThe black goo discovered at the site at Amara West.\nThere is more to be discovered! Most of the research so far has been into later examples of black goo, we hope that looking at examples from earlier times will tell us how the ingredients changed over time. We also hope to make some of the black goo ourselves to enable us to think more about how it was stored, transported and poured, what it smelt like, and how hot it had to be. This will help us to reimagine what a funeral might have been like in ancient Egyptian times.\nThe Department of Scientific Research and Dr Kate Fulcher\u2019s work are supported by the Wellcome Trust."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/historical-city-travel-guide-rome-1st-century-ad/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Historical city travel guide: Rome, 1st century AD", "author": "Francesca Bologna, Project Curator, Department of Greece and Rome", "timestamp": "2020-05-15 00:00:00", "text": "Location\nRome in Latium, central Italy, is the capital of the Roman Empire. The great city is said to have been founded by Romulus, who was raised with his brother Remus by a she-wolf. He was a descendant of the prince Aeneas, who escaped his home city of Troy after it was sacked by the Greeks. However, the city\u2019s origins are likely to have been slightly less romantic, developing in the 8th century BC through the merging of several villages.\nReconstruction of the classical city of Rome as a bird\u2019s-eye view.\nAmbrogio Brambilla, c. 1580s. Etching. Find out more.\nSpanning seven hills on the left bank of the river Tiber, Rome is located about 22 km (14 miles) inland from the Mediterranean Sea as the crow flies. The area is suitable for farming and characterised by warm weather, but the plains between the hills were originally swampy and subject to flooding. That is why, initially, different villages developed on the hilltops rather than in the Tiber valley.\nThe city now sits at the centre of an empire which stretches from Spain to Syria and is rapidly growing.\nIt is not without good reason that gods and men chose this place to build our city: these hills with their pure air; this convenient river by which crops may be floated down from the interior and foreign commodities brought up; a sea handy to our needs, but far enough away to guard us from foreign fleets; our situation in the very centre of Italy. All these advantages shape this most favoured of sites into a city destined for glory.\n\nLivy, History of Rome, 5, 54.4\nTravel\nArrival\nThe saying \u2018all roads lead to Rome\u2019 is true. A complex network of roads connects the whole empire to Rome, so wherever you\u2019re coming from you can be sure of finding your way into the capital.\nYou are likely to see tombs on alongside the roads outside the city.

Some have inscriptions asking travellers to respect and pity the dead, while other incorporate benches and invite you to take a rest on your journey.\nRome can be accessed by sea as well as land.

The emperor Claudius has recently built an artificial harbour called Portus, 2 km to the north of Ostia. This artificial harbour is connected to the river Tiber by a canal and to the city of Rome by road (Via Campana/Portuensis).\nGetting around\nMembers of the upper classes often use litters to move around the city, but most people\u00a0walk or use carriages.\nCoin showing a carpentum, a type of carriage drawn by two mules. AD 37\u201341. Find out more.\nTraffic congestion is a real problem in Rome, and to limit it, heavy vehicles cannot be used within the city from sunrise to late afternoon (exceptions are made for constructing temples or other public works, religious festivals or if you are a priest, Vestal Virgin or triumphing general). As a result, most business deliveries are made at night \u2013 if you are staying in the centre of the city you may be kept awake by the sound of wheels and hooves hitting the streets, the loading and unloading of carriages, and the occasional shouts and bickering among coachmen.\nThings to do\nThe capital is full of incredible monuments and buildings. We recommend taking your time and just walking around the city.\nHere are a few things not to miss:\nTemple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus\nThis temple, dedicated to the \u2018Capitoline Triad\u2019 (the gods Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva) on the Capitoline Hill, is the most important temple of the capital, completed at the beginning of the Republic in 509 BC. It was destroyed by fire in 83 BC, but reconstructed in 69 BC, and recently restored by the great Emperor Augustus. According to Plutarch, the assassins Brutus and Cassius locked themselves inside this temple after killing Julius Caesar.\nSilver coin showing the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, 78 BC. Find out more.\nForum Romanum\nThe forum is the main political, ritual, and civic space in the city, located in the valley between the Capitoline and Palatine Hills. The forum has existed since Rome\u2019s early history and it is here you can really experience the hustle and bustle of city life. It has a number of temples, which are worth visiting (Temple of Saturn, Temple of Concordia, Temple of Vesta, Temple of the Castors). There are also some of the most important political buildings of the city, the Curia (the council house of the Roman Senate) and the Comitium (the meeting space for the public assembly).\nThe Roman Forum.

As well as the emperor, powerful senators and skilled orators frequent the Curia, and the Vestal Virgins, Rome\u2019s most important priestesses charged with keeping the sacred fire alight, live behind the Temple of Vesta.\nThe Sacra Via\nThe Sacra Via, a sacred route used for important ceremonies, passes through the forum square and leads to the Capitoline Hill and the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. This is the route taken by Roman Triumphs \u2013 processions held to celebrate and sanctify the victories of Rome\u2019s military commanders, which comprise sacrifices and dedications to the gods, feasting, and public games. Triumphs are rare, so count yourself lucky is you manage to see one during your visit.\nDrawing of a relief from an honorary monument to Marcus Aurelius showing a triumph. 18th century. Find out more.\nCampus Martius\nThe Campus Martius can be found right outside the city walls next to the River Tiber. In the past this area was used for assemblies and as a military exercise ground, however, since the end of the Republican period new temples have sprung up as well as a circus (Circus Flaminius) for track racing. Today, it is largely covered by public buildings, including the Ara Pacis, an altar dedicated to Pax, the goddess of peace.\nBaths\nIf you want to treat yourself to a spa day during your visit, there are plenty of public and private baths to choose from. If you\u2019re lucky enough to know a wealthy city dweller, you might be invited to bathe at a private heated bath house \u2013 there are nearly 200 throughout the city. Alternatively, try the public baths built by Agrippa in the Campus Martius in 25 BC, or the even more spectacular baths of Nero nearby.\nRoman women in the baths as imagined by tbe artist, Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema.

Throughout the city there is plenty to keep you entertained. There are lots of circuses, where you can see the celebrities of the chariot racing world compete in edge-of-your-seat spectacles. Charioteers belonging to four different factions (the Red, White, Green, and Blue) who race against each other on two or four-horse chariots (bigae and quadrigae). If you\u2019re feeling lucky, take a bet on your favourite team.

Find out more.\nThe commercial district of the city is called the Emporium, and it can be found just outside the city walls and south of the Aventine Hill. It is characterised by quays, warehouses and other buildings for the unloading, storage, and distribution of commodities brought up the river. This part of the city is constantly bustling with activity, with sailors manoeuvring among quays, porters loading and unloading ships, merchants carrying on with their trades, and imperial officers inspecting documents, ships, and goods.\nIn the valley between the southern end of the Viminal and the western end of the Esquiline, is the Subura, a residential and commercial neighbourhood. Its lower half, toward the Forum, is notoriously crowded, dirty, noisy, and crime ridden and may be best avoided. Roman authors have repeatedly commented on the widespread prostitution and low-quality building materials in this area.\nIf you want to escape from the bustle of the city, private gardens (horti) belonging to the emperor and other aristocratic families can be found on the northern and eastern borders of the city, often expanding beyond the city walls. Here there are buildings of considerable size and luxury, used as secluded residences or for private entertainment.\nFood and drink\nMeals in Rome are structured around key times of day, which vary seasonally. The day starts at dawn (1st hour), by the 6th hour (around noon) people usually stop for rest and to eat, while dinner typically takes place at the 9th hour (early afternoon).\nBronze baking-pan for cakes and bread-rolls.

Here you can enjoy a cup of wine (which will be diluted with water) and snack on a range of food from salt-meat and sausages and peas and beans, to confectionery. Romans use different kinds of sauces to season their food, but the most common is garum, made from fermented fish (locals love it but it might not be to everyone\u2019s taste!) \u2013 watch out though, garum can sometimes be used by butchers to conceal the smell of rotting meat, so check your produce before you buy it!\nA street bar in Pompeii.\nThese taverns are usually characterised by a wide opening towards the street and a serving counter placed at the very front, to attend clients quickly. Some of these establishments also offer rooms where customers can sit to enjoy their meal, chat, and play dices or other games. However, Roman authors warn us that these sorts of eateries are often frequented by people of dubious morals and low social standing, so keep an eye out.\nFine dining\nMembers of the Roman elite tend not to eat or drink in public. They enjoy their dinners at private gatherings, where the meal is accompanied and followed by some sort of entertainment. These dinners can often be incredibly lavish \u2013 so put on your best tunic if you are lucky enough to be invited to a dinner party during your visit.\nPanel from a mosaic floor showing fish from the Mediterranean area.

These include flamingo (especially its tongue), peacock, different kinds of songbirds, snails, and dormice, allegedly fattened up in jars. There will be cultured discussion during the meal, moving from politics, to philosophy and poetry, to current gossips, sports, how to best manage one\u2019s slaves, and the price of different goods. Entertainment is also provided in the form of music, poetry, or more extravagant activities. This can easily escalate, among the aristocratic circles, in shows of one-upmanship, with friends and acquaintances trying to outdo each other.\nDrinking\nWine is the main drink among the Romans, but it is stronger than the wine that we are used to drinking. Therefore, it is diluted with cold or warm water (usually one part wine to three parts water) and sometimes mixed with honey, herbs and spices (a kind of mulled wine). Many different varieties of wine are drunk in Rome, and some are particularly sought after. Chian wine is possibly the most prized Greek wine. The emperor Augustus is said to have particularly appreciated the Setinum wine produced in Latium. Falerian wine from Campania is also prized and, among imported wines, those from Spain are highly valued.\nAt a Roman party you may drink from a cup like this.

First published in 1831, the woodblock print has inspired generations of artists \u2013 one of the official posters of the Paralympics in Tokyo, now postponed until August 2021, is The Sky above The Great Wave off the Coast of Kanagawa by manga artist Araki Hirohiko that depicts sporting gods descending on Japan from a stormy sea of clouds.\nThree impressions of the Great Wave in our new Collection online.\nYou may not know that there are many impressions of the Great Wave, and there isn\u2019t one \u2018definitive\u2019 version. For example, the British Museum has three impressions in the collection, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has four and Maidstone Museum (UK) has one that was recently displayed in its exhibition Japan: A Floating World in Print. My work, in collaboration with researchers in the Department of Asia, has focused on finding out how we can tell the differences between these impressions, aiming to piece together a chronology of these amazing prints, so we can tell when in the sequence they were made.\nWoodblock prints were inexpensive (you could buy a print of the Great Wave for the same price as about two helpings of noodles in the mid-19th century) and prints of a given design were produced as long as there were customers willing to buy them.\nEarly printing of the Great Wave.\nHokusai\u2019s famous work was among the first prints in Japan to use Prussian blue, a new synthetic pigment that resisted fading, imported from China and the Netherlands (the only countries Japan traded with in the 1830s). Before Prussian blue reached Japan, printmakers used the blue dyes indigo and dayflower blue, which are much less vibrant. The drama of the gigantic wave about to engulf the three small boats together with the new blue colour made the print incredibly popular in Japan.\nThe making of woodblock prints\nJapanese woodblock prints of the same design vary in the exact colours and printing effects used. The example of Kajikazawa in Kai Province by Hokusai below shows how a print can evolve over time,\u00a0a phenomenon that intrigues art historians and collectors. Surprisingly, although The Great Wave is probably the most famous Japanese artwork of all time, its evolution has rarely been studied in detail.\nKajikazawa in Kai Province by Hokusai printed using different colour schemes. Top and bottom.\nPrints like this are not dated or numbered, but woodblocks suffer damage during the printing process, which can be used as a way to determine the evolution of a design through time. We can search for signs of woodblock wear in the prints, which is what I have been doing as part of this project. For instance, when prints of the Great Wave are compared carefully, you will notice that lines in the image have disappeared in some prints, but not in others, like in the example below. The prints without lines were made with a woodblock that had missing ridges, hence we can say they were made after the prints with the lines, which were printed when the woodblock was still in good condition.\nClose up on the area under the boat on the left hand side of two prints of the Great Wave: the wave outline is well-defined in the print on the left (British Museum 2008,3008.1.JA) but has almost disappeared in the print on the right (British Museum 1937,0710,0.147).\nCatching the waves\nNo records of the number of prints of the Great Wave produced during the Edo Period exist, and how many of these have survived to this day has not been established. But given the commercial success of the design, printmakers would have produced prints until the woodblocks literally wore out. Experts have estimated that this might represent around 8,000 prints. And because the prints were not considered valuable at the time, their owners did not take much care of them and in most cases would end up throwing them away! Earthquakes and fires were also frequent in Japanese cities and many prints were destroyed. Therefore, it is likely that the majority of the prints of the Great Wave have been lost, so we have a limited number that we can compare and analyse.\nTo study the evolution of the design of the print, I have been searching for surviving impressions. I consulted the online collections of numerous museums, galleries and libraries as well as the records of major auction houses. I also examined books and approached art dealers and private collectors. I found several photographs of the Great Wave using the Google Arts & Culture and online on Flickr, Pinterest, Twitter, Instagram and even TripAdvisor (the Great Wave is very popular on social media!). In total, I managed to obtain photographs of 111 original prints. During the detective work I also came across some reproductions (i.e. later prints made with a different set of woodblocks) that were falsely labelled as originals, but that is another story\u2026\nAnalysing the details\nKeyblock of a modern reproduction of the Great Wave.\nThe main outlines you see in the Great Wave were printed using the \u2018keyblock\u2019, which is carved with very fine ridges. The set of woodblocks used for the original prints of the Great Wave are long lost, but you can see the keyblock of a modern reproduction above. The keyblock suffered the most from wear and tear, in particular in the delicate title cartouche (the box with writing in) in the top right hand corner (left on the actual print of course). Looking at different editions of the print, I observed losses in three areas in the double frame of the cartouche, as highlighted below.\nOver time, the ridges of the title cartouche in the Great Wave suffered damage in three areas. Compare the pristine cartouche on the left (British Museum, 2008,3008.1.JA) with the three breaks in the cartouche on the right (British Museum 1937,0710,0.147)\nThe print of the Great Wave in the first image of this blog has no breaks in its outlines \u2013 it is an early printing. Early printings are very important as experts believe that the artists only chose the colours and printing effects for these prints. Later on, the publisher (whose role was to commission and sell prints) would make changes in order to appeal to more customers or lower the cost of production.\nI noticed that breaks in the keyblock also occurred in the outline of Mount Fuji in the background and in the outline of a wave on the right. You can see the location and the order in which the losses took place on a late printing below. Note how different this late printing looks compared to the early printing \u2013 the sky is much more colourful and the printmaker has inked the grey woodblock in such a way as to depict rain in the sky, which is incredibly rare.\nLocation of the breaks in the keyblock on a late printing of the Great Wave. The numbers indicate the chronological order in which the breaks occurred. (Katsushika Hokusai. Under the Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura), 1830/33. The Art Institute of Chicago 1952.343, CC0 Public Domain Designation)\nI was excited to discover that printmakers used two new woodblocks in very late printings of the Great Wave \u2013 one for the light blue patterns in the sea and another one for the yellow parts of the boats. These new woodblocks were far from perfect replacements of the original woodblocks, though. See, for example, below how the light blue areas in the late printings have a more angular shape than in earlier printings. There are also areas on the late printing where the boats should have been printed yellow originally but were left white. If you look back at the image above, there is no yellow at all in the boat on the left hand side.\nLight blue areas in late impressions (left: Katsushika Hokusai. Under the Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura), 1830/33 The Art Institute of Chicago 1952.343, CC0 Public Domain Designation) were not printed with the same woodblock as in early printings (right: British Museum 2008,3008.1.JA).\nFinally, I came across four prints that look completely different from all the others and ones that I had never encountered before starting this research \u2013 the boats were pink and the clouds were printed dark brown with a gradation effect (below). Nevertheless, when I examined these four prints in detail, I came to the conclusion that they are indeed originals. To be more precise, they are the very last printings of the Great Wave. There are signs of woodblock wear in all the expected areas and the printmaker had used a new woodblock for the boats to print them in pink. The reason for carving this new woodblock remains a mystery, but I find it fascinating that, even when the woodblocks were very damaged, there were still people wanting to buy a print of the Great Wave!\nOne of the latest prints of the Great Wave (1916.685, Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M. Sackler Museum, Gift of Dr Denman W. Ross, \u00a9 President and Fellows of Harvard College).\nWhat does this tell us about the making of this masterpiece?\nMy findings raise some questions. Why did the publisher commission new woodblocks? Why did the woodblock cutter carve them so differently from the original ones, and even make obvious mistakes?\nPerhaps the original woodblocks became so damaged that they had to be replaced. Nevertheless, it would not have been difficult for an experienced woodblock cutter to make new woodblocks very similar to the original ones. This might suggest a rushed operation or lack of care.\nA woodblock is carved as part of our 2017 documentary on Hokusai.\nBut the publisher of the Great Wave, Nishimuraya Yohachi, was recognised for having a very high standard of carving and printing, so this lack of care would be surprising. According to a letter dated 1836, he experienced economic difficulties in the mid-1830s so this might provide an explanation. Maybe Nishimuraya sold the woodblocks to another publisher with lower standards. Another possibility is that he had to commission cheap woodblocks because he didn\u2019t have the resources for high quality ones anymore.\nWe may never know\u2026 but I hope that the next time you come across an image of the Great Wave, you will take time to look carefully, and see if you can spot any differences.\nZoom\u00a0in\u00a0to\u00a0this\u00a0incredible\u00a0work\u00a0using\u00a0our\u00a0revamped\u00a0Collection\u00a0online.\nYou\u00a0can\u00a0now\u00a0pan\u00a0and\u00a0zoom\u00a0over\u00a0images\u00a0to\u00a0reveal\u00a0details\u00a0you\u00a0might\u00a0not\u00a0have\u00a0noticed\u00a0before and\u00a0there\u00a0are\u00a0also\u00a0lots\u00a0of\u00a0new\u00a0behind-the-scenes\u00a0images\u00a0too.\u00a0See\u00a0more of\u00a0the\u00a0Great\u00a0Wave\u00a0here.\nFind\u00a0out\u00a0some\u00a0other\u00a0things\u00a0you\u00a0might\u00a0not\u00a0have\u00a0known\u00a0about\u00a0this\u00a0iconic\u00a0image\u00a0in\u00a0our\u00a0blog\u00a0post, or read more about the famous wave in our Objects in Focus book."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/historical-city-travel-guide-nineveh-7th-century-bc/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Historical city travel guide: Nineveh, 7th century BC", "author": "Gareth Brereton, Curator: Ancient Mesopotamia", "timestamp": "2020-05-07 00:00:00", "text": "Location\nThe city of Nineveh has recently undergone extensive development to become the new capital of the mighty Assyrian empire. It is now a vast metropolis surrounded by massive walls some 12 kilometres in length that encompass an area of 750 hectares (7.5km2) in size. While official statistics on the population of Nineveh are not available, it reportedly takes three days to cross the city.\nThis cosmopolitan city is located on the eastern bank of the River Tigris at the intersection of the road which connects the highlands of the north with the prosperous lands of Babylonia and Chaldea in the south.\nRelief showing orchards and gardens watered by an aqueduct and how the reliefs would have been originally coloured.\nA veritable paradise on earth, the fertile lands surrounding Nineveh are perfect for growing the huge volumes of staple crops such as wheat and barley needed to feed the population of this colossal city. Benefitting from plentiful rainfall, the city is also situated where the River Khosr meets the River Tigris, which guarantees an abundant supply of water. A monumental aqueduct brings water over a vast distance to feed the city\u2019s network of canals. Upstream from the city you will find orchards planted with vines, fruit trees and olive groves.\nWhen to visit\nThe summer months in Assyria are ferociously hot and are best avoided. Winters are often very wet and the city is transformed into a quagmire. The best times to visit are autumn and spring, when the city has warm days with cool mornings and evenings.\nGetting there\nBy river\nTravelling from the north, the city can be easily reached via the River Tigris using the quppu ferry service, a local round-boat woven from bundles of reeds and waterproofed with bitumen. If travelling by river from the south expect a longer journey as you sail against the flow of the river. Most quppus dock in the city quay.\nOverland\nThanks to the Assyria royal road network, travelling to the city on donkey or mule is quick and convenient. Major routes include the north-south road from the foothills of the Taurus Mountains down to Babylonia, and the east-west road from the Zagros Mountains to the Levantine coast. Accommodation and food stalls are plentiful along the major routes. Government officials with an appropriate authorisation will be able to stay at the posting stations which can be found every 20-30 km along all major routes.\nRelief showing a mule carrying equipment for a hunt. Assyrian, 645\u2013640 BC.\nGetting around\nWhile Nineveh is huge, it is still possible to reach most destinations on foot. Should you wish to travel by donkey or mule, there are numerous rental places throughout the city. Nineveh and its surrounding area is famous for its network of canals so make sure you take a ride in a guppu boat or one of the local gondolas.\nThings to see and do\nThe city walls and gates\nOn reaching the city you will be amazed by its massive walls and the 18 city gates, which are flanked with colossal human-headed bulls carved from blocks of gypsum alabaster. They are known locally as Iamassu and are believed to prevent evil forces from entering the city.\nSculpture of a winged bull (lamassu) from the Assyrian city of Nimrud. 865\u2013860 BC.\nThe \u2018Palace Without Rival\u2019\nThis fabulous palace was built by King Sennacherib at the turn of the century to be a wonder for all people and is not to be missed. Its name, the \u2018Palace Without Rival\u2019, is well deserved, as it covers around 500m x 250m and is situated on a high terrace overlooking the city. The exterior facades of the palace are made from tens of thousands of baked bricks erected on a foundation of limestone blocks which are faced with polished white plaster and capped with blue-glazed bricks. Huge doors of cedar wood are adorned with decorated shiny copper bands while the arches and copings are adorned with colourful glazed tiles.\nDrawing of a relief showing city walls. Assyrian, 645\u2013640 BC.\nThe palace is formed of several large paved courtyards surrounded by suites of rooms and corridors. Be sure to look out for some of the cast bronze columns with bases in the form of fierce lions. A technological marvel! Visit the in-vogue b\u012bt-\u1e2bil\u0101ni room, said to be a perfect replica of a Hittite palace.\nArtist\u2019s impression of a hall in an Assyrian palace from\u00a0The Monuments of Nineveh by Sir Austen Henry Layard, 1853.\nShould you be lucky enough to visit the throne room you will be greeted by a towered facade with three entrances flanked by colossal human-headed winged bulls. Beyond the throne room you will find the administrative, ceremonial and domestic quarters of the palace, but these are definitely off limits to visitors.\nGrander rooms in the palace are decorated with stone wall panels carved with narrative scenes and protective magical figures, all of which are brilliantly coloured. It is said that if the reliefs were all placed together, they would extend for a length of 3km!\nThe botanical gardens\nThe famous gardens of Nineveh are a must for any plant and animal lover. The terraced palace gardens are said to be a replica of Mount Amanus (Ed. in modern-day Turkey) and feature all kinds of aromatic plants and fruit trees. Just outside of the city are botanical gardens with a unique collection of aromatic trees from the land of \u1e2aatti (Ed. in modern-day Turkey), fruit trees, and trees from the mountains and the lands of Chaldea (Ed. in the south of modern-day Iraq). The gardens are watered by an intricate network of canals. In the game reserves you will find wild boar, roe deer, and if you\u2019re lucky, you might even spot a lion! The garden shop is well stocked with flowers from across the empire, as well as a wide variety of cooking herbs and medicinal plants.\nCarved panel depicting a lion and lioness relaxing in a lush garden setting. Assyrian, 645\u2013640 BC.\nThe ziggurat\nThis massive temple tower stands proudly on the citadel mound and can be seen from all corners of the city. The tower features successive receding stories accessible by a series of steep stairways. It is built from a core of sun-baked bricks faced with fired bricks that are glazed in different colours. Sadly, the ziggurat is closed to general visitors and only accessible to the priesthood, so you will need to admire its grandeur from afar.\nTemple of Ishtar\nDedicated to Ishtar of Nineveh, the goddess of warfare and passion, this temple complex has stood in the same place for over a thousand years. The nearby temple of Nabu is dedicated to the god of literature, scribes and wisdom. Both sanctuaries are notable for their facades of colourful glazed tiles and bricks, interior rooms lined with carved stone wall panels and numerous rich embellishments of gold and silver.\nEntertainment\nFestivals\nMusicians and priests take part in a religious procession. Assyrian, 705\u2013681 BC\nNineveh\u2019s busy cultic calendar sees citywide festivals take place throughout the year. A must for any visitor, these colourful events are a time when the city\u2019s devout populace take to the streets to enjoy the festivities and to receive fresh bread, beer, and honey cakes (delicious!).\nLion hunts\nNineveh is famous for the spectacular and brutal lion hunts that take place in the game parks located outside the city. By combining sport, ritual and theatre, the Assyrian kings publicly display their valour and military skill as they slay ferocious lions from their battle chariots. The best spot to view the action is the hill beside the hunting grounds \u2013 get there early to beat the crowds.\nRelief depicting king Ashurbanipal hunting a lion. Assyrian, 645\u2013640 BC.\nRecitals\nDon\u2019t miss the weekly shows of the Epic of Gilgamesh, performed by dancers and acrobats acting out the hero\u2019s adventures, and the monthly recitals of the Epic of Creation, with the Assyrian state god Ashur as the lead role.\n\nSports and exercise\nDaily exercise is important. The citizens of Nineveh love to take a stroll along the Tigris in the early evening and children can always be seen running around and playing tag (though note that ball games are not played). Renting a horse can be expensive, but well worth it on public holidays, when racing is permitted in the parade ground below the Arsenal. Fishing is also popular.\nGames\nThe most popular board game is the Game of Twenty Squares (also known as the Royal Game of Ur), over a thousand years old but still going strong! Luxury sets made of gold, ivory and precious stones are available at high-end outlets, but you can just as easily make your own version by scratching the outline on a brick and using pebbles as pieces. It is rumoured that a few years ago some soldiers scratched the board into one of the king\u2019s winged bull sculptures. They were punished by being sent to work in the quarries.\nFind out how to play the Game of Twenty Squares here.\nThe Game of Twenty Squares board. Wood and shell. Ur, 2600\u20132400 BC.\nVictory parades\nSome say that the Assyrian war machine is unstoppable, crushing all that stands before it. If you\u2019re lucky, you may get to witness an Assyrian victory triumph, as prisoners and war booty are paraded through the city streets. But beware, they aren\u2019t for the faint hearted \u2013 often the grizzly spectacles end in the severed heads of enemies being displayed on the city\u2019s ramparts!\nShopping\nNineveh is a major centre of trade and there are plenty of shopping opportunities to be had throughout the city\u2019s markets. Payment is generally in silver or copper, most larger retailers will also accept grain or dates. Many outlets will accept credit if backed up by a personal seal.\nDrawing of an Assyrian door sill in the form of a carpet. Assyrian, 645\u2013640 BC.\nLocal crafts can be purchased in the artisanal quarter, located in the north west of the city, best accessed by the Sin Gate or Nergal Gate. Nineveh\u2019s bronze workers are renowned for their skill and technological innovations, while Assyrian woven carpets and hemmed garments are highly sought after.\nMarkets and stalls selling fresh mountain produce and livestock from the highlands can be found in the north eastern quarter of the city, especially along the road that runs from the Halahhu Gate. Exotic merchandise and bulk bargains can be found in the city quay and the surrounding merchants quarter. Look out for goods such as purple cloth and ivory from Phoenicia (Ed. modern-day Lebanon), spices and incense from Arabia, textiles and woods from Turkey and Iran and wine from Syria.\nPhoenician ivory of a winged sphinx. 9th\u20138th century BC.\nAssyrian literature is famous and includes a wide range of stories, prayers and historical and other texts. While the famous state Library of Ashurbanipal can only be visited by appointment (restricted to established scholars), the city has numerous bookshops.\nFood and drink\nThe lavish banquets held by the Assyrian aristocracy are something to behold. On the inauguration of a new place, thousands of VIP guests flock to the city where they are fed, bathed and anointed to the sounds of music and joyful celebration. Hundreds of fattened oxen, thousands of sheep and vast quantities of game such as deer, ducks, pigeons and turtle doves are served at these extravagant banquets!\nDetail from a relief showing king Ashurbanipal\u2019s queen feasting in a garden.\n645\u2013635 BC.\nHumbler dishes can be found at street stalls located in the markets and by the city quay. On offer are various broths, flatbreads stuffed with mutton and tasty vegetable fillings, cheese, fresh fruit, honey cakes, sweets and delicious dates sourced from Chaldea. Local delicacies include the nutritious snack of crunchy roast grasshoppers served on a stick as well as spiced grilled river-carp.\nSilver beaker decorated with gold leaf. Assyrian, c. 750\u2013700 BC.\nCraft beer is booming, and new taverns are opening up all over the city, so it\u2019s best to ask a local for up-to-the-minute tips, but make sure you sample the local fig-beer. The best drinking spots are located to the northeast of the city and by the city quay, many of which have live music. Taverns located in the merchants\u2019 quarter have a seedy reputation and are best avoided after dark. Wine lovers should head to the north west of the city, near the wealthier residences that surround the citadel mound. The local custom is to drink wine from bronze and silver bowls. Look out for the rich reds sourced from the kingdom of Urartu\u2019s celebrated cellars.\nBusiness Information\nBanking\nLoans of silver, copper and barley are available at most major temples, at competitive rates. Try not to default on your loan though \u2013 you may be charged with a penalty in excess of 1000%, as well as being subjected to ritual humiliations.\nInvestments\nNineveh has a vibrant economy. For those wishing to buy futures in grain prices or options on temple services, the results of the daily examination of sheeps livers (used to read the future) are published at midday (except festivals days).\nBuying property\nAttracted to this wonderful city? Considering investing? Purchasing property is easy. All you need is your personal seal (both stamp seals and cylinder seals are accepted) and at least two witnesses. Payment is generally in silver. You can also buy plots of land and build your own home \u2013 but please make sure not to encroach on the Royal Road, for which the penalty is death.\nLocal laws and customs\nDespite its size, Nineveh is a relatively safe place for visitors. Crime and dissent is low as the punishments are severe. Violation of state property, theft and abduction are commonly punishable by impalement! Visitors to the city would be wise to respect local laws at all times!\nTo discover more about ancient Assyria you can read our Introduction the Assyrians blog here."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/100-years-of-science-and-conservation-recent-conservation-highlights/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "100 years of science and conservation: recent conservation highlights", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2020-05-05 00:00:00", "text": "2020 marks 100 years since the creation of the \u2018Research Laboratory\u2019 \u2013 a space for developing and conducting scientific research and conservation on the British Museum collection, which would later become the Departments of Scientific Research and Collection Care. Continuing our centenary celebrations, we highlight some of the recent success stories from our conservation teams, reflecting the diversity and range of their work.\nThe variety of objects in the British Museum collection offers our conservators the opportunity to work in specialised areas within the inorganic materials (stone, metals, ceramics, glass); organic materials (wood, textiles, plant and animal materials, plastics); pictorial art (graphic art on paper, photographs, papyrus, conservation mounting) and preventive (reducing the rate of deterioration in objects) teams. These projects highlight how conservators use their in-depth knowledge of materials and expert hand skills, plus how they utilise both low-tech solutions and high-tech equipment in their work.\nBringing the Sherborne cartonnage back to life\nOne of the challenges facing conservator Verena Kotonski in the organic materials studio when we re-open is a newly acquired Ptolemaic period Egyptian coffin. Excavated in 1907 during the First Archaeological Survey of Nubia, the location and context of the coffin\u2019s burial are well-documented. However, its whereabouts following excavation remained mysterious until recently, when it was realised that it was the coffin acquired in 1915 by Colonel Wingfield Digby of Sherborne Castle, Dorset, and displayed at the Castle until 2000. In 2018 it came to the British Museum, and is the only example of this type of coffin in the collection.\nMade of painted cartonnage \u2013 layers of linen cloth glued together and covered with paint \u2013 the coffin had deteriorated badly after years of standing upright in damp conditions. The cartonnage had slumped, with textile layers separating and damage to the paint layers occurring \u2013 it looked almost beyond repair.\nThe coffin lid (L) and base (R) before conservation.\nThanks to Verena\u2019s ministrations, both parts of the coffin are now being gradually brought back to their original shape. Sat inside polythene humidity tents, a combination of the controlled introduction of moisture and application of just the right amount of pressure enables Verena to manipulate the material. An earlier reinforcement of cardboard, glued to the inside of the coffin base, was exacerbating the distortion and is being painstakingly removed. The complex task is made all the more tricky when the presence of mould means that Verena must work with suitable protective equipment.\nVerena Kotonski in the process of reshaping the lid of the cartonnage.\nVerena Kotonski working on the coffin base, wearing protective equipment to minimise the health risk posed by the mould.\nLook out for a forthcoming film following the conservation treatment. Following the completion of conservation, a detailed description and images of the cartonnage coffin will also be made available on Collection online.\nThis work is funded by the John S Cohen Foundation.\nCombining \u2018traditional\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019 in conservation\nThe Ceramics, Glass and Metals Conservation Team combine a variety of skills and use a range of materials and techniques which can be adapted to both ancient and modern objects.\u00a0One example is the use of old shimbari technique on metal objects. The technique is a traditional Japanese method for restoring lacquer objects. By surrounding an object in a three-dimensional frame, padded bamboo or plastic sticks can be modified to apply pressure to the surface of unusually shaped objects for extended periods of time.\nMetals conservator Rachel Weatherall used the shimbari technique on a silver mirror casket to re-adhere silver. The silver on the exterior of this mirror casket was cracked and lifting in several places, and the underlying wood and lacquer substrate (base layer) was very fragile. She injected consolidant under the lifting areas with a syringe and could apply just the right amount of light pressure to fix the silver in place without damaging the wooden structure beneath.\nRachel Weatherall using the shimbari technique to conserve historical silver objects.\nThis technique is also useful when it is necessary to apply significant pressure for a long period of time, as in the case of a bidriware (a type of metal handicraft) bowl, which had loosening silver inlays. The silver was so thick and hardened that it would lift up again while the adhesive applied was setting. Using a shimbari frame and thick bamboo sticks, it was possible to hold the silver in place for several days to allow the adhesive to set.\nThe technique is applied to a bidriware bowl.\nBigger objects, different challenges\nThe work of conservators in Stone Conservation can sometimes take several months to complete because of the sheer size of the objects. Karen Birkh\u00f6lzer worked for more than 220 hours to conserve this pentelic marble sarcophagus with the scenes of the life of Achillies for our 2019 exhibition on Troy.\nKaren Birkh\u00f6lzer in-painting new repair fills on the sarcophagus.\nKaren worked with two other conservators, Tomasina Munden and Francesca D\u2019Anellio on the sarcophagus. Francesca came to the Museum for work experience as a recent conservation graduate. The Conservation Section regularly hosts students in placements which are a great way for them to get hands-on practice while learning and collaborating with experienced conservators.\nTomasina Munden and Francesca D\u2019Aniello cleaning the sarcophagus and removing plaster repairs which have deteriorated over time.\nPreventive Conservation\nWhen we re-open, the preventive team will continue the process of moving the collections from the Museum\u2019s satellite sites at Blythe House and Orsman Road, to the purpose built storage facilities at the World Conservation and Exhibition Centre in Bloomsbury. The movement of these objects means the preventive team can ensure that each item is correctly supported with conservation-grade materials, which will reduce the stress and strain on vulnerable edges and remove unnecessary folds from fragile textiles.\nThe WCEC has a dedicated air conditioning system so it can provide a stable environment for the collections in terms of humidity and temperature. This is vital as many materials, particularly wood, expand and contract with variations in humidity \u2013 similar to the way in which metals react to changes in temperature. The move to the central site will also enable greater access and make it easier for both British Museum staff and external experts and researchers to see these collections.\nBethany Skuce and Rachel Howie adjusting packing materials in the new WCEC store.\nThe preventive team monitors the environment across the British Museum estate using sensors that send measurements of the humidity and temperature to a central system so that all areas can be seen from a computer. There are over 700 sensors that each send information back every 15 minutes, and Fabiana and a team of conservators are now monitoring these from home. These sensors also need to be calibrated once a year to ensure that they are providing accurate information. Each sensor must be exposed to three different salts that have defined levels of humidity, and then can be individually adjusted to correct any \u2018drift\u2019 in the readings.\nFabiana Portoni calibrating the environmental monitoring equipment.\nGetting up close and personal to a masterpiece\nMichelangelo\u2019s cartoon Epifania was, for many years, on display in the Prints and Drawings gallery. The opportunity to take a much closer look came in 2018 when the unframed cartoon came into the Western Art on Paper studio for examination and essential treatment. The first priority was to remove the cartoon and its 19th-century paper backing from the heavy wooden panel, on which it had been mounted for some time before its acquisition in 1895.\nJude Rayner, Megumi Mizumura, Sam Taylor and Caroline Barry lifting the cartoon from the wooden panel.\nAn extended period of examination under different lighting and magnification, alongside new techniques such as digital mapping and 3D scanning, has given conservators a way to describe in detail the manufacture, history and condition of the cartoon for the first time. As conservation is still underway, we look forward to sharing this information when the cartoon is back on display.\nA detail of the cartoon overlaid with the digital damage map.\nThis work has been funded in memory of Melvin R Seiden.\nMore science and conservation stories\nWe\u2019ll be sharing more stories and revealing new work from both the Department of Scientific Research and the Department of Collection Care over the coming year. Stay tuned to find out more about the amazing work that goes on behind the scenes here at the Museum to help us care for the collection and continue uncovering stories from history.\nYou can read abut our recent Scientific Research success stories here."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/fake-antiquities-made-for-unsuspecting-collectors/", "category": "News", "title": "Fake antiquities made for unsuspecting collectors", "author": "St John Simpson, Assistant Keeper in the Middle East Department, British Museum", "timestamp": "2020-05-05 00:00:00", "text": "On 1 July 2019 two metal trunks were opened at Heathrow Airport after catching the attention of an eagle-eyed Border Force officer. They were consigned from Bahrain to a private address in the UK. The trunks were found to be filled with what initially looked like objects from ancient Mesopotamia, modern day Iraq, and dating between about 2000 BC and 500 BC. The trunks had as many as 190 clay tablets covered in cuneiform script (a type of writing used in Mesopotamia), figurines, cylinder seals (made in order to make impressions in wet clay), and some rather unusual and imaginative animal-shaped pots. All were individually packaged in bubble-wrap and parcel tape. Photographs of a selection were immediately taken and sent to the British Museum, rapidly followed by the objects themselves for closer expert identification. This is an important but little-known part of our job at the Museum and it is crucial to be swift in our response so that cases can be investigated carefully by law enforcement\nFake cuneiform tablets in their wrapping\nEvery case is different and it is always exciting to open up trunks like these and call in the most appropriate curators to assess the items in detail. In this instance the cuneiform tablets represent a virtually complete range of basic types known from ancient Mesopotamia: school texts for trainee scribes, administrative texts, royal inscriptions, mathematical texts and others resembling official documents from temples and public buildings. There was also an inscribed amulet resembling a unique example excavated at the Late Assyrian capital of Nimrud.\nIt is as if the whole genre of ancient Mesopotamian writing is on display, an entire collection ready for a single informed buyer. But there is one glaring problem. Not one is ancient. Some of the inscriptions contain real signs and the royal inscription begins with a known formula and imitates an inscription carved from stone; the amulet is undoubtedly copied from another found at Nimrud. The rest of the inscriptions are a jumble of signs, some invented, others upside-down, a complete mish-mash which made no sense when read.\nThe clay is all a similar type, which would be impossible for such a wide chronological and functional range of genuine inscriptions from different sites. If real, these tablets would simply have been sun-dried clay but these have all been fired deliberately and consistently, and to a relatively high temperature, proving that they are the product of a modern workshop with a kiln. The clay itself is also the wrong kind for the types of tablet. Additionally, the sizes and thicknesses of the tablets don\u2019t match those of the originals \u2013 a common error of forgers who often work from photographs in books, and don\u2019t get a sense of the true dimensions of these objects.\nFake cuneiform tablets unwrapped for assessment\nThe cylinder seals found in the trunks were also made of fired clay rather than characteristic stone, and some curious figurines looked like \u2018teasers\u2019 for a prospective buyer interested in widening their collection yet further. Not long after the first trunks were opened, two more arrived at Heathrow, this time with many more of the figurines and some animal-shaped pottery vessels. It immediately confirmed our suspicions and made us realise that there are surely more trunks of fakes somewhere out there\u2026\nAn Addams Family of fake figurines\nThis is evidence for a side of the trade in antiquities which is rarely discussed \u2013 there are more fakes in circulation than genuine articles. It is easier and cheaper to make copies than it is to hire dozens of workers to look for originals. Fakes can also be conveniently complete, whereas almost everything from antiquity has been broken, either deliberately in episodes of destruction, or accidentally in the case of everyday items. There is also the simple economic truth of the laws of supply and demand.\nLooting causes terrible destruction to archaeological sites like this one in southern Iraq where the illegal diggers were looking for ancient cuneiform tablets and cylinder seals\nIt is highly risky to loot archaeological sites in countries such as Iraq and Iran \u2013 the death penalty has been awarded for such offences as they are considered such serious breaches of national antiquity laws. The largescale looting of sites in southern Iraq which took place in the immediate chaotic aftermath of the overthrow of government, law and order after the American-led invasion in 2003, ended long ago, and today there is a highly efficient and armed archaeological police service who regularly patrol sites and guard museums and archaeological projects 24/7.\nThe archaeological police of the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage in Baghdad seize antiquities, as featured in Iraqi media\nSomeone has therefore chosen to find another solution to fuelling the market, and that is through making crude copies and passing them off as originals. The whereabouts of the workshop is uncertain but it is within the Middle East. Faking tablets has been known for over 200 years and they began to appear even before cuneiform had been deciphered. However, this is the first time that we have seen fakes of this particular type \u2013 this is a new production line aimed at private individuals with little or no knowledge of the originals. They didn\u2019t get far as they caught the attention of Border Force and were stopped from reaching their intended destination. The fakes will instead now be used for teaching and training purposes and a selection will go on display for a short period at the British Museum when it reopens. This display will be in the special showcase in Room 53 where we have previously shown Gandharan sculptures and the temple carving from Surkh Kotal, stolen from the National Museum of Afghanistan \u2013 all of which are going back to Kabul when the lockdown eases.\nThe British Museum is the main advisory body in the UK in the case of enquiries over stolen or possible illicit trafficking of antiquities. If objects are considered suspicious by the UK Border Force, Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs, the National Crime Agency, Metropolitan Police, auction house or private individuals, we are notified and our expert advice sought. If the items prove to be stolen or trafficked, we notify the national museum in the country where we believe them to have originated, request permission to proceed and inform their embassy in London. We produce a report for the investigating agency, catalogue and photograph the objects and, if resources allow, we scientifically analyse them in order to answer any specific questions. Our part is then done until we are notified that the objects may be returned to the country in question. At that point we produce a press release, work with the relevant museum and embassy to ensure a smooth handover, and keep relevant parties updated. This is a protocol we developed many years ago with the National Museum of Afghanistan, and we are delighted to share some of these successes here on the British Museum blog.\nTo discover more, you can read a blog about the Museum\u2019s work in identifying and returning looted objects, and a blog on returning objects from the ancient site of Tello in Iraq. \u00a0You\u00a0can\u00a0also\u00a0read\u00a0an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Dr\u00a0St\u00a0John\u00a0Simpson about collaboration with foreign museums, restoring stolen art, and the museum\u2019s role as expert witness to looting."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/make-your-own-origami-inspired-by-japanese-prints/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Make your own origami inspired by Japanese prints", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2020-04-29 00:00:00", "text": "Origami (from\u00a0ori\u00a0meaning \u2018folding\u2019, and\u00a0kami\u00a0meaning \u2018paper\u2019) is the ancient Japanese art of paper folding. It is believed that paper was first invented in China around the second century AD however many people believe that paper is even older than this.\nPaper was brought to Japan around 500 AD by Buddhist monks. In Japan folding paper became an art form. At first it was mostly used in religious ceremonies, because paper was expensive, and most people couldn\u2019t afford to buy it. Origami was also used to create paper butterflies for wedding ceremonies. By the 1600s, play-origami was used throughout Japan and had spread to Europe as well.

What facts and inaccuracies will future historians read about the events of 2020, and how will artists, writers and thinkers present them?\nI learn about our present and future by looking to the past \u2013 that\u2019s why I am a historian. In the documents of lost civilisations and the creations of long-dead individuals I try to understand both the exceptional and the enduring aspects of life. Humanity has faced disease, famine, war and more over the millennia. Cities have fallen and societies have disappeared. Yet despite moments of devastation and annihilation, there are more humans on the face of the earth than at any other time. Humanity is resilient. We do leave our mark.\nOur beloved galleries and museums have shut their doors \u2013 something only done previously as an extreme measure during wartime.

Suffragette penny\nPenny of Edward VII defaced to promote the suffragette cause c.1913.\nFor me, what makes an artwork enduring is its ability to capture a shared experience or sensation that speaks to our deeper needs as human beings \u2013 those timeless things that bind us across time. But the British Museum also preserves objects that document specific moments. It can be a moment that heralds new hope and change for the better, as this simple coin records.\nThis English penny shows the face of a man \u2013 King Edward VII \u2013 defaced by women. It\u2019s an act of civil disobedience, a rebellion on a small scale but still a criminal act. Each letter has been individually stamped to create the words \u2018VOTES FOR WOMEN\u2019 covering the face the head of government and the church \u2013 the king. This simple penny helps connect us directly with the powerful aims of the suffragettes. It certainly has shock value and brings home the importance of what women were fighting for at the turn of the 20th century. I for one thank the women who turned this coin into a political protest. I wouldn\u2019t be speaking to you today if it wasn\u2019t for their efforts.\n2. C R W Nevinson\u2019s A\u00a0Dawn\nC R W Nevinson (1889\u20131946), A\u00a0Dawn. Drypoint, 1916.\nThe impact of the two world wars are still very real nearly a century later. Our modern world has been shaped by them. As women gained the vote, millions of young men were sent to their deaths. We can read about their experiences in their letters, their poems, their diaries. But I find the art produced after the wars some of the most moving testaments to the horrors and brutality experienced by so many.\nC R W Nevinson went to the front line in 1914 and as an ambulance driver saw the violent results of war carved on the bodies of those he helped. This evidence of the destruction modern weapons could do stayed with him his whole life and led him to create some of the most moving images from this time. His Vorticist style shows a seething mass of soldiers reduced to mechanical forms.\nIn the unforgiving light of an autumnal morning in Flanders overloaded soldiers march to a life in the trenches with no one to cheer them on. They are downtrodden yet stoic, part of a machine of destruction and Nevinson\u2019s powerful style captures this with such bite and immediacy that is very hard to forget.\n3. Day of the Dead figures\nWorkshop of the Linares family (1980s onwards), The\u00a0Atomic\u00a0Apocalypse. Day of the Dead figure made from papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 over cane framework, 1980s.\nThe British Museum continues to add to its collection, preserving artworks and objects that will tell future generations of our present time. These Day of the Dead models made in Mexico by the Linares family and called Atomic Apocalypse walk a fine line between laughter and terror. Here the skeletons reflect on actual events, like the bombing of Hiroshima, while the four horsemen of the apocalypse \u2013 War, Pestilence, Famine and Death \u2013 ride horrifying creatures around a small and fragile-looking planet earth. The bright colours and antics of the skeletal figures give a carnival feel to the scene. But for me it captures the glaring horrors of our modern world which all too often feel all too close.\n4. 16th-century tabernacle\nMiniature boxwood tabernacle, carved in Flanders 1500\u20131530.\nI include this last one for no reason other than that its technical virtuosity never fails to blow me away. The miniaturist detailing exhibited on this 16th century tabernacle not only invite a kind of spiritual play \u2013 unravelling the various parts while contemplating the religious scenes depicted \u2013 but also makes me ask time and again \u2018how was it possibly made\u2019?\nAs I stare dumbfounded at the minute spears held by the soldiers in the crucifixion scene, as I look at the drapery which almost needs a magnifying glass to be seen, I wonder at the skills our predecessors possessed. This wonder is a source of hope. This search for beauty is a worthwhile quest.\nAs part of BBC Arts\u2019 Museums in Quarantine series, which starts on Monday 27 April, tune in to BBC Four at 19.30 BST on Thursday 30 April as Janina goes behind locked doors at the British Museum, telling you more about her favourite objects from the collection and how they resonate today.\nWatch Museums in Quarantine: British Museum online on BBC iPlayer here.\nThe British Museum allowed a small crew into the Museum to film a selection of objects.

Three years old, I think.\nI remember the smell of cold fried chicken mixed with the smell of cardboard. The chicken was part of the meal that our mother had prepared for the family. Fried chicken in a shoe box. I could not know then that we were on a train from our home in Chicago, heading down South.\nIn those days, in the early 1950s, the train would have been racially segregated. We would have been seated, by law and custom, in a crowded section of the train. We would not have been allowed to eat in the dining car.\nPostcard of Chicago station. c. 1915.\nWe were going to rural Mississippi, the most racially segregated section of the entire United States.\nThis was where my father\u2019s beloved mother, my grandmother lived. In a town called \u2018Money\u2019 on\u00a0the Mississippi Delta. Blues country.\nI remember her yard, full of dust and chickens picking the ground. And her bedroom, the dresser crowded with beautiful things. I really loved those chickens. I really loved those beautiful things.\nPhotograph of Emmett Till.\nLibrary of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division, LC-USZ62-104052.\nA few years later, a young boy from our part of Chicago went to visit his grandmother in Money, too.\u00a0But he never came back. His name was Emmet Till and his brutal murder at the hands of local white men and their subsequent acquittal helped spark the next phase of the Civil Rights Movement.\nI was too young and sheltered when all this happened to know.\nBut what I did know about, even at three, was the fresh air and the space and the sky of Mississippi.\u00a0So different from the overcrowded conditions of our life in the big city.\nI did not know that my family and I had been confined to a ghetto.\nI did not know that my entire childhood was being defined by the question of whether I and my father and my mother and my gran and my brothers and my sisters were actually full human beings.\nThe second \u00a0journey\u00a0took place when I was a teen. I had been sent, for the summer, to a posh, all-white suburb north of Chicago. I was there to de-segregate the local school. This was the 1960s and efforts were being made by people of goodwill to give my life a future.\nThe train that I took home after school was filled with maids going back to where I lived. Going home to their own kids. Once they all smiled at me and one of the ladies asked what I was\u00a0 doing \u00a0going to school \u2018up there\u2019. I did not know. All that I knew, then, was that America was not my home. I had been told by my father that we had come, long ago \u2018from Africa\u2019. That we had been \u2018taken away\u2019 and made into slaves. That one day we would return. In Africa, our lives would be better because we would have our inheritance.\u00a0 Our kingdoms. Our language. Our clothing. Our music. Our gods.\nA mother with her daughter on the steps of the Supreme Court following the 1954 ruling in\u00a0Brown\u00a0v.\u00a0Board of Education of Topeka. 19 November 1954.\nLibrary of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division, LC-USZ62-104052.\nThe third journey in my memory now was to the former slave fortress at Elmina, on the Atlantic Coast of Ghana, over two decades ago.\nI was in the country to teach at the film school, and the day after my course was over, I and the class were to be taken on a day trip to the Coast.\nAlso in my hotel were my fellow African Americans, decked out for the journey.\nI recall a man wearing the insignia of one African nation on his shirt lapel. And another on his belt.\u00a0He, like all of us from the US, had created a kind of country of the mind and of the heart and of the will. And we were \u2018back home\u2019.\nPhotograph of Elmina castle, Ghana. Around 1905.\nI cannot recall how I missed the tour bus and ended up with a European photographer in a taxi. The heat made him very uncomfortable and disagreeable and he only had conversation for his Leica.\nOur first stop was the compound of the Ashatene. The photographer wanted to take photos.\nI quickly distanced myself from him and made my own way around.\nSuddenly there was a revelation like a bolt of lightning: I noticed him sweating. Profusely. And wiping his face and fanning himself with his hat.\nIt was then that I\u00a0thought to myself that, in the main, Europeans would have suffered here in this place, in this area. Would they have come nevertheless? And if they did not\u2026 then\u00a0who took me to the coast? To Elmina?\u00a0To the boats?\u00a0Into The Void to my unwilling\u00a0transformation.\nPhotograph of Elmina Castle, Ghana. Photo by Mary S R Sinclair. 1936.\nAfter we drove to the coast, I walked into Elmina Castle.\nMy fellow African Americans from the hotel were there crying and singing.\nI was not.\nI saw the slave caves stark and white and cold and precise.\u00a0 I saw on an upper level the photo of an Asantehene exiled by the British. I saw where the governor of the castle lived. I imagined that I saw a crucifix on the wall there.\nAfter that, I climbed the steps to the top of the castle and looked at the deep, dark ocean.\nPlan and cross-section of the slave ship \u2018Brookes\u2019 of Liverpool, 1789.

And at the places that it docked.\nI consider myself part of a people and a nation that I call: Meta Africa.\nKara Walker (b. 1969), no world, 2010. Print. \u00a9 Kara Walker.\nWhen the Director of the British Museum, Hartwig Fischer, asked me, a former Trustee, if I would like to return and do something at the Museum, I said yes.\nThe result of a series of conversations that we had, that we are still having, is the idea of reclamation as a sign of our time. We call the project \u2018The Era Of Reclamation\u2019.\nWe, all of us, want to take something back; have something back. What that is differs from person to person; from community to community; from nation to nation.\nAnd in these days, it might just simply be that we want back the lives we had before the pandemic.\nMaybe it is our human connection that, above all, we want back, that we need back right now. This includes our ancient connections, as well as the whole and full and complex truth about them. And what better arena for this journey, this conversation, this debate,\u00a0 than a global museum. The greatest of them.\nPanelists at the first \u2018Era Of Reclamation\u2019 event at the British Museum, 10 January 2020.\nLeft to right: Professor Olivette Otele PhD, Bristol University, and Vice President of the Royal Historical Society; Bonnie Greer: Dr Miranda Lowe, Natural History Museum, London; Dr Valika Smeuthers, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.\nThe conversations, debates, performances and art that have emerged, and will emerge from \u2018The Era Of Reclamation\u2019 will contribute to a kind of marker for our time.\nHere, inside the British Museum, a theatre of human connection, reclamation can find the seeds that can begin the process of an even deeper, more profound engagement.\nWe need now to see and know that we are the same species, with the same stories.\nAnd that we have always been in search of what we ultimately are seeking to reclaim: ourselves.\nI hope that the \u2018Era Of Reclamation\u2019 can become a signpost on the long journey to truth, reconciliation, justice, peace. And healing.\nMy posts on the British Museum\u2019s blog will document that journey.\nRead more about the Era of Reclamation in Bonnie\u2019s blog here.\nBonnie Greer\u2019s Audible podcast \u2018In Search of Black History\u2019 is free for 30 days, find out more and download episodes here."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/13-landscapes-to-lose-yourself-in/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "13 landscapes to lose yourself in", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2020-04-14 00:00:00", "text": "If you\u2019re longing for new vistas, you might enjoy a wander through these lovely landscapes. From the blissful tranquillity of Turner\u2019s Tintern Abbey, to the depiction of marshes in the tomb of Egyptian nobleman Nebuman over 3,000 years ago, they provide some much-needed escapism.\nJ M W Turner (1775\u20131851), Tintern Abbey, the transept. Watercolour on paper, c. 1794.\nRising from the banks of the lush Wye Valley in the south of Wales, roofless and magical, Tintern Abbey has stirred the imagination for generations. Wordsworth wrote of the 12th-century abbey\u2019s situation on the \u2018sylvan Wye\u2019, beneath \u2018steep and lofty cliffs\u2019 and J M W Turner made this magnificent watercolour in around 1794 while still a teenager. Turner was as much impressed by the way nature had reclaimed the abbey as by its grandeur \u2013 and his time as an architectural draughtsman is evident in this detailed study.\nMinjung Kim (b. 1982), Mountain. Ink on hanji paper, 2009. \u00a9 Minjung Kim. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nDeep understanding of materials and media can give stunning results, as South Korean artist Minjung Kim shows. Kim trained in calligraphy for 15 years, getting to know ink and mulberry paper (hanji) so well that she says, \u2018today, I only have to touch the paper with my fingers to know how it will absorb the water, how the ink will spread on it\u2019. In Mountain, ink was brushed on while the paper was wet, bleeding upwards to create delicate tidelines suggesting a hilly landscape \u2013 where does it remind you of?\nRelief showing orchards and gardens watered by an aqueduct. Nineveh, Iraq, 7th century BC.\nThis palace relief from ancient Assyria shows gardens watered by an aqueduct built by then-king Sennacherib. Dating to the 7th century BC, it shows aqueducts in lush parkland, watered by several channels that cut across the landscape. The panel would have originally been painted with rich colours, recreated here. A feat of engineering, the aqueduct was constructed over 500 years before the Romans started building their aqueducts \u2013 read more about Assyria\u2019s ancient gardens here.\nFragment of painting from the tomb of Nebamun, Egypt, 1350 BC.\nAround 600 years earlier in 1350 BC in Thebes, Egypt, a great tomb was created in honour of the recently deceased nobleman Nebamun. To accompany him on his journey in the afterlife was a fine painting of showing him fowling and fishing in the marshes. Nebamun stands, throw-stick in hand, on a small papyrus boat with his wife Hatshepsut behind him and their daughter between his legs.

Mostly made by brush painting or engraving the surface of the rock, the sites depict a range of images \u2013 human figures, large animals like giraffe and antelope, personal ornaments and musical instruments, geometric shapes, animal tracks as well as human hand and foot prints.\nSee more spectacular landscapes and photography from our African Rock Art Project, get close to hundreds of examples of in-situ rock art and even go on a VR tour of selected sites from the comfort of your home here.\nFresco of a coastal landscape from a villa in Boscoreale, Italy, c. 30 BC.\nWealthy Romans loved to decorate interiors with wall paintings, such as this panel dating from around 30 BC, from a villa at Boscoreale, near Pompeii. In this charming scene a boat leaves harbour, its sail billowing in the wind, watched from a seaside villa by several people, one of whom raises an arm to wave goodbye. We can almost feel the brisk sea breeze from the artist\u2019s impressionistic brushstrokes.\nTerry Frost (1915\u20132003), Bow movement; Black and white movement. Drypoint print, 1956. \u00a9 Terry Frost. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nAnother harbour \u2013 this time in St Ives \u2013 is captured here by Sir Terry Frost (1915\u20132003), a key member of the \u2018St Ives School\u2019 of artists associated with the fishing town in Cornwall, on the south west coast of England. This drypoint print is based on the boats moored in the harbour, a subject Frost had explored since the early 1950s.\nHe described in 1954 the sensations he had tried to capture in an earlier treatment of the theme: \u201cI had spent a number of evenings looking out over the harbour at St Ives\u2026 Although I had been observing a multiplicity of movement during those evenings, they all evoked a common emotion or mood \u2013 a state of delight in front of nature.\u201d (Frances Carey & Antony Griffiths, Avant-Garde British Printmaking 1914\u20131960, British Museum Press).\nKunmanara Hogan, Tjaruwa Woods, Yarangka Thomas, Estelle Hogan, Myrtle Pennington, Ngalpingka Simms; Kungkarangkalpa (Seven Sisters). Acrylic on canvas, 2013. \u00a9 the artists, courtesy of the Spinifex Arts Project.\nThis painting, titled Kungkarangkalpa (Seven Sisters), depicts a spiritual landscape in the Great Victoria Desert of Western Australia. It was painted collaboratively in 2013 by a group of senior Aboriginal women of the Spinifex People.\nIt shows the story of Seven Sisters, a major ancestral (or Dreaming) narrative. The Sisters sang and danced across the land, followed by a lustful man. The women escape his unwanted attention by launching themselves from a hill into the sky, where they become the Seven Sisters constellation (the Pleiades). Such paintings from the deserts of Australia commonly depict the great travelling paths of ancestral beings. In the guise of humans, plants or animals, they crossed the land creating its features such as hills and waterholes. Some of these ancestral journeys cover thousands of miles.\nUtagawa Hiroshige (1797\u20131858), No 17 Yui, Satta-mine (Yui: Satta Peak), part of the series Tokaido gojusan-tsugi no uchi (Fifty-Three Stations of the Tokaido Highway). Colour woodblock oban print, 1833\u20131834.\nAnother coastal landscape \u2013 and another print \u2013 but wonderfully evocative again. This colour woodblock print was made in Japan by renowned artist Utagawa Hiroshige (1797\u20131858). It shows three tiny figures high on the Satta pass. A woodcutter trudges with a large load, oblivious to the spectacular view, but the other two travellers gaze and gesticulate towards Mount Fuji, perfectly symmetrical and elegantly white on the horizon across Suruga Bay. Find out how Japanese woodblock prints are made in our curator\u2019s blog.\nXiang Shengmo (1597\u20131658), Reading in the Autumn Mountains. Ink on paper scroll, 1623.\nFrom the Japanese coastline in the 19th century to the mountains of China 200 years earlier, take a deep breath and immerse yourself in this painted scroll titled \u2018Reading in the Autumn Mountains\u2019.\u00a0Made by Ming dynasty artist Xiang Shengmo (1597\u20131658), this painting transports you to the forest near Mount Baiyue (now Mount Qiyun) in Anhui province in the east of China. See the birds fly and the mountains soar!\nSchool of Miskin (active c. 1560\u20131604), mounted painting in gouache on paper of the crow addressing the animals, Mughal style. Gouache on paper, c. 1590\u20131620.\nStaying in the mountains, we join a throng of creatures, from dragons and cheetahs, to crocodiles, vultures and frogs, gathered around a rocky outcrop to listen to the wise crow, perched on the peak. This Mughal dynasty gouache painting, attributed to India\u2019s School of Miskin in around 1590\u20131620, may be an episode from the popular fable of the crows and the owls, whose quarrel begins when a crow speaks out against the election of an owl as the leader of the animals.\nAlfred Maudslay (1850\u20131931), Black-and-white photograph of the ruins of Tik\u00e1l in Guatemala. Photograph printed on paper, 1890 \u20131891.\nThe birth of photography in the mid 19th century meant new ways to document the world. This photograph was taken in the late 1800s by British archaeologist Alfred Maudslay (1850\u20131931), who took over 800 photos of Maya ruins and also created plaster casts of these amazing monuments, documenting the ancient urban environments. This photo looks towards the Maya site of Tik\u00e1l in Guatemala.\nYou can read more about Maudslay\u2019s work, including how casts of Maya sites are being used today, in our virtual exhibition.\nKiliii Yuyan (b. 1979), Boreal Forest Dash. Archival inkjet print, 2019. \u00a9 Kiliii Yuyan.\nTo finish our round-up of landscapes is this spellbinding photo taken by Kiliii Yuyan (b. 1979). It shows Taiga (referred to as the Boreal forest in North America) which has small, but in some places, thick tree growth. You might have seen Yuyan\u2019s amazing photography used for our upcoming exhibition about the Arctic. He showcases the diverse landscapes and hidden stories of the northernmost region of the world in photography and film, exploring Arctic Peoples\u2019 relationship with the natural world.\nSee more of Yuyan\u2019s photography and learn more about the Arctic in our curator\u2019s blog.\nTake a (virtual) step outside and get lost in all kinds of landscapes by searching our Collection online.

He was referring to another type of ceramic vessel \u2013 a Grecian urn \u2013 but I think of his immortal lines when I look at these beautiful blue-and-white porcelains, with designs of birds resting on blossoming branches. They are delicate, but they also represent strength, specifically the strength of the ties between nations.\nThey were made in China, yet the form of the moon-shaped flask derives from Middle Eastern glass, while the geometric borders are copied from the patterns found on Middle Eastern metalwork. They inspire me to think of beauty and strength simultaneously, and the links between the two.\nJoanne Dyer, Scientist: Colour Science\nNewton\u2019s\u00a0prism\nAs the British Museum\u2019s Colour Scientist, the inspirational object that immediately comes to mind isn\u2019t on display, yet it probably played a huge part in defining our modern understanding of light and colour.\nMeasuring a little under 20 cm, the unassuming object is a glass prism once owned by Sir Isaac Newton himself. It remained in his family until 1927 when it was donated to the British Museum. Almost 350 years ago in 1672, Newton published a series of experiments to prove that the refraction of light was responsible for colours. He used a series of glass prisms (maybe even this one!) to refract white light, resolving it into its component colours, and disproving the belief at the time that colours were made from a mixture of light and darkness.\nJim Peters, Collection Manager: Care and Access\nLindow\u00a0Man\nWhen the body of a 25-year-old male was discovered in Cheshire I was a 10-year-old boy with an interest in history. However, hearing the story of his discovery on TV changed this \u2018interest\u2019 into a full-on obsession. The discovery of Lindow Man subsequently influenced my subject and career choices.\nAt this time, I was in University College Hospital having surgery on my legs and was bed bound while the Lindow Man story was revealed. To keep me stimulated I would be taken to the British Museum \u2013 and during these visits I fell in love with the place. On the day Lindow Man was put on display I was right at the front of the queue to be one of the first people to see him.\n20 Years ago I started work at the Museum and it felt like my story had come full circle from a wide-eyed 10-year-old to becoming the person responsible for the daily care of Lindow Man.\nDavina Seelumbur, Security Warder\nStatue of Amenhotep III\nI have been captivated by ancient Egypt ever since my mother first spoke about her visit to the British Museum in 1972 to see the golden mask of the boy king Tutankhamun. Now, as an employee of the Museum, it is always a pleasure to walk through the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery to view my favourite object \u2013 Amenhotep III.\nThe imposing granodiorite seated statue depicts the official image of the pharaoh \u2013 half human, half divine, with head dress complete with a cobra for divine authority. The pharaoh\u2019s enchanting face and strong form evokes images of the fascinating art and culture of ancient Egypt.\nSir Paul Ruddock, Museum Trustee\nThe\u00a0Lewis\u00a0Chessmen\nFor my 8th birthday (in 1966!), my parents bought me the British Museum\u2019s replica set of the Lewis chess pieces. They were incredibly realistic and were coloured to look like the original weathered walrus ivory. The pawns on the two sides are different shapes and the kings, queens, bishops, knights and rooks are all slightly different, as they are in the originals.\nIt was on this set that my father taught me to play chess 53 years ago. I still have the entire set (intact!) and colleagues at the Museum tell me that occasionally people still bring in a piece of their own thinking that it is real, only to be disappointed when the tiny \u2018BM\u2019 stamp on the back is pointed out!\nWithout a doubt, this is what started me on a life-long love of medieval works of art which continues to this day.\nJasmine Lota, Visitor Assistant\n18th-century\u00a0chocolate\u00a0cups\nNestled away in the corner of one of my favourite rooms, the Enlightenment Gallery, lie some inconspicuous cups, so easily skimmed over but behind which lie a fascinating story. It\u2019s such a pleasure to really have a good look around the collections to find small treasures.\nThese little cups are for drinking chocolate \u2013 promoted for its health-giving properties by the founder of the Museum, Sir Hans Sloane. His advice, which is still relevant today was to \u2018take it in moderation\u2019 as he found it in great quantities \u2018nauseous and hard of digestion\u2019.\nFrom its origins in Central America thousands of years ago, to its travels around the world, chocolate truly is a global phenomenon. So, as you tuck into your eggs this Easter, take heed of Sloane\u2019s words, and enjoy.\nSebastien Rey, Lead Archaeologist\nTemple\u00a0guardian\u00a0from\u00a0ancient\u00a0Sumer\nAmong all the treasures from Mesopotamia exhibited in the British Museum, the one which holds the most symbolic meaning is this 4,000-year-old Temple guardian from the Sumerian site of Girsu in Iraq. Made from copper in the form of a kneeling god with the horned crown of power, it holds a foundation peg marked with the name of the temple\u2019s divine owner, Ningirsu, and the seal of the ruler, Gudea. Also known as praying wizards in Sumerian, they were placed in temple foundations to commemorate the ruler\u2019s piety.\nNew research at the temple site in Girsu has shown that they were far more than ordinary votive objects dedicated to Sumerian gods \u2013 they delineated the sacred space and moored the temple symbolically to the ground protecting it from the supernatural forces of chaos.\nDr Kate Fulcher, Research Assistant\nAncient\u00a0Egyptian\u00a0paintbrushes\nIn ancient Egypt people used plant materials to make paintbrushes. The simplest ones were just sticks with frayed ends, but some were complex, using different plants, or different parts of the same plant. During a research trip to the ancient Egyptian town at Amara West, now in Sudan, I attempted to recreate the process of making and using paints in ancient times.\nNo paintbrushes survive from Amara West, so I took these ancient Egyptian brushes in the collection as my inspiration! I experimented with various local plant resources to attempt to manufacture a paintbrush. I had the most success with the fruit-bearing branches of the date palm. The broken end can be beaten with a hammerstone to create bristles, which can be held together using a thin strand tied around. It\u2019s harder than it looks!\nAprille P Tijam \u2013 Senior Manager, Exhibitions and Collections, Ayala Museum, Philippines. ITP Fellow 2019\nAltarpiece\nLooking at this 18th-century Philippine retablo \u2013 an altarpiece from the Ayala Museum Collection with elaborate wooden framework enclosing religious sculptures \u2013 allows me to step back in time when life was perhaps less complicated. I appreciate the natural beauty of the local wood transformed by artisans with beautifully hand-carved estofado design, simulating local foliage. I admire how creative the artisans were, with no computers to aid them, in putting together this huge altarpiece with wooden pegs alone, akin to Lego bricks.\nI reflect on the role of this altarpiece which served as sanctuary to parishioners for more than 300 years.\u00a0 It provided them solace where prayers were offered, allowing momentary quiet and peace in their hearts for the difficulties in life. For me, the retablo represents faith in a powerful being.\nDavid Noden, Collection Manager: Loans and Display\nYaxchilan lintel\nFor me, the Yaxchilan Maya lintels proved to be a gateway into a world I knew nothing about. I joined the Museum as a technician in 1983, straight from a building site, so my knowledge of museums was limited.\nBut the thing about objects is that they inspire you to learn more \u2013 the lintels did that for me. I started to read about Mesoamerican cultures, to take more notice of other objects in the collection, and to read about them. My interest may have moved on to other parts of the collection over the years but I still love going into Room 27.\nFind an object that sparks something in you, learn about it, and go where it takes you.\nHartwig Fischer, Director\nThe\u00a0Gayer-Anderson\u00a0Cat\nClosing the British Museum to the public and asking colleagues to stay home during the Corona crisis was a very emotional moment. The Museum wants to welcome visitors from all over the country and the world, the objects want to be looked at, the collections want to be explored; when walking through the deserted galleries just before leaving myself, sunlight directed me towards this bronze cat, an avatar of the Egyptian goddess Bastet, donated to a temple by a wealthy worshipper. I love cats, admire their elegance, independence, sensuality, and caprice. I marvel at their enigmatic silence, their unfathomable gaze. Time stands still when they sit motionless, languidly opening their eyes that disdain to see us.\nThis cat has traversed millennia; sitting motionless it holds the past, awaits the future \u2013 I felt consoled in its unperturbable presence, thinking that it was there to guide us silently to another epoque, full of promises and new directions. Then I read the label: \u2018The scarab beetles on the cat\u2019s head and chest symbolise rebirth, while the silver udjat-eye on the pectoral invoke protection and healing.\u2019\nSir Richard Lambert, Trustee and Chairman of the British Museum\n14th-century\u00a0alabaster\u00a0carving\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Virgin\u00a0and\u00a0Child\nShe\u2019s not the biggest star of the collection, but it\u2019s her backstory I find compelling. The Madonna with Child was made in the Midlands in the 14th century out of alabaster that had been mined nearby. That\u2019s remarkable enough, but what makes her really special is that she survived the English Reformation in the 16th century, when most of her sisters were smashed.\nShe\u2019d found her way to Belgium, and there she survived another round of destruction, when her abbey home was pillaged in the French Revolution. Somehow, she\u2019d found her way into safe private hands. She arrived in Bloomsbury in 2016, and the only marks on her face are those of devotion \u2013 worn from centuries of caresses by pilgrims.\nJiyi Ryu, Curator of the Korean Collections\nDecorated\u00a0roof\u00a0tile\nThis Korean roof tile from the ancient capital city of Gyeongju was made in the 7th or 8th century AD. Decorated roof tiles with beastly faces \u2013 \uadc0\uba74\uc640 (Guimyunwa) \u2013 started to become widespread in the late 7th century and enjoyed a golden age throughout the 8th century in the Unified Silla Dynasty (AD 676\u2013935) of Korea. These kind of tiles were placed at the top corners of the roofs of royal buildings, Buddhist temples and houses.\nThis particular tile is around 30cm tall with the moulded decoration of a striking face. The fierce face features a monster mask or portrays a dragon \u2013 it was designed to ward off evil spirits as a cause of sickness, death and disasters.\nSarah Jaffray, Project Officer, Bridget Riley Art Foundation\nHenry\u00a0Moore\u2019s Shelter\u00a0Sketchbook\nAfter his studio and home were destroyed during the London blitz, Henry Moore (1898\u20131986) sheltered in a nearby tube station. His experience of regularly sheltering was explored in a series of drawings that we now call The Shelter Sketchbook (1940\u20131941). Respecting the vulnerability of his fellow \u2018shelterers\u2019, Moore did not draw from them directly. Instead, he drew them from memory in the privacy of his studio as an outlet to express himself during the war.\nHe described the works as reflecting the tension and apprehension shared by everyone at the time. The Shelter Sketchbook provides us with imaginative, poetic interpretations that are also historically accurate, documenting what it felt like to live through sudden devastation. For me, they are some of the most inspirational artworks in the collection.\nElizabeth Morrison, Marketing Manager\nEl Anatsui Man\u2019s\u00a0Cloth\nOne of the most striking objects in Room 25 is what looks like a large, flowing tapestry \u2013 it\u2019s directly in front of you as you walk into the gallery. As you get closer, you\u2019ll realise that it\u2019s not quite what it seems to be \u2013 although the panel says it was inspired by traditional West African woven textiles, Man\u2019s Cloth is actually made up of strips of recycled bottle-neck wrappers that are stapled together with wire, creating a wonderful three-dimensional work.\nThe object is a reminder that small actions or moments, when put together among many others, can add up to great effect. It\u2019s currently on loan to Kunstmuseum Bern, in Switzerland in an exhibition dedicated to Anatsui\u2019s work aptly called Triumphal Scale \u2013 hopefully re-opening soon.\nSaeed Ba Yashoot, Documentation Collections Curator, Seiyun Museum, Yemen. ITP Fellow 2016\nRose-water\u00a0sprinkler\nThis object, a rose-water sprinkler, is just one of many related to the Hadhrami culture donated to the Museum by the late Ms. Leila Ingrams and her parents who lived in the Hadhramaut region of the Aden Protectorate (later part of Yemen) during the 1930s and 1940s.\nI was inspired by the story behind this object and its similarity to objects at my museum. This sprinkler, made in India and taken to Hadhramaut, helps us understand the link between the Hadhrami community and the Indian Ocean. The people of Hadhramaut travelled the Indian Ocean region and East Africa for many centuries, and when emigrants returned back to their homeland they brought objects with them which would influence their home cultures.\nEleanor Ghey, Curator: Iron Age and Roman Coin Hoards\nFigurine of Senuna\nMy inspirational object is the Romano-British figurine of Senuna found at Ashwell, Hertfordshire in 2002 (show in the centre above). This silver statuette of a previously unrecorded deity was found in fragments alongside a spectacular collection of gold and silver plaques and jewellery. An excavation was carried out by local archaeologists working with the British Museum to understand more about this hoard. Was it a temple treasure? When was it buried, and by whom?\nThe results of this excavation are inspiring to me because they revealed an important deposit of Iron Age coins at the same place, buried several hundred years earlier. This shows that people in Roman Britain had a continued understanding of special places in their local landscape that survived the Roman conquest. Senuna also inspires me in the knowledge that there is always more to discover about our past.\nSue Brunning, Curator: Early Medieval Collections\nShoulder-clasps\nThese spectacular shoulder-clasps were buried in a ship with a VIP \u2013 possibly a king \u2013 at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk in the early \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019 period. They are decorated with hundreds of glass and garnet inlays, arranged to create intricate geometric and animal designs. Despite the technique\u2019s limitations, the maker achieved incredible levels of detail. At the curved ends, boars \u2013 powerful symbols in Early Medieval thought \u2013 have sharp tusks, bristled backs and curly tails. Below, the chequered panel is bordered by sinuous beasts with blue glass eyes, as small as a dot from a felt-tip pen.\n20 years ago, as an undergraduate visiting the British Museum, these clasps inspired me to study the Early Medieval period. I suppose you could say they are responsible for me being a curator here today!\nClarissa Farr, Museum Trustee\nDawn\nDeep in the Mitsubishi Corporation Japanese Galleries is a beautiful ceramic plate, a suspended celestial disc glowing with blue, green and yellow glaze, like liquid light. Made in 1992, Dawn by Tokuda Yasokichi III (1933\u20132009) shows us how a traditional Japanese glazing method has been given a mesmerizing modern interpretation through Yasokichi\u2019s\u00a0 blended, watercolour-like technique.\nWhen I learned that Japan was the birthplace of ceramics 17,000 years ago, I marvelled at how different forms of making, developed across millennia, connect us to our past. In times of trouble, the British Museum\u2019s collection shows us how stories of survival can strengthen our imagination for what lies ahead. Dawn is not only a beautiful object in its own right \u2013 it speaks of the future\u2019s infinite possibilities.\nStay\u00a0tuned\u00a0for\u00a0more\u00a0staff\u00a0picks\u00a0to\u00a0inspire\u00a0and\u00a0delight\u00a0coming\u00a0soon.\nWe\u2019d love to hear what inspirational tales you\u2019ve found in museums or galleries, or which artworks you think are powerful \u2013 share your stories by tweeting us @britishmuseum."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/mary-beards-top-five-objects/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Mary Beard's top five objects", "author": "Mary Beard, Professor of Classics, University of Cambridge", "timestamp": "2020-04-08 00:00:00", "text": "I am very excited to become a Trustee of the British Museum (after some hiccoughs along the way). And I am realistic that there is going to be quite a lot of work involved. In part I see this as a way of paying back my debts to the Museum. I first went there with my Mum, making the trip from Shropshire in 1960, when I was just five years old. I remember being amazed by the sculptures from the Parthenon, asking myself how people could possibly have made something as good as that so long ago. It was I think the first time I realised that human history hadn\u2019t simply been a story of continuous progress!\nWhat really made my visit, though, was a small piece of ancient Egyptian cake or bread, thousands of years old. I was amazed that a bit of cake could have survived from the time of the pharaohs and was desperate to get a closer look.\nBack in 1960 museum displays were nothing like so child-friendly as they are now, and this particular case was too high for me to see into clearly. But, as my Mum struggled to lift me up, a man walked past and asked what was going on. When we explained, hesitantly, that I was trying to get a proper view of the cake, he reached for some keys, opened up the case, took the cake out, and held it right in front of my eyes.\nI\u2019ve never forgotten the excitement of that first close encounter with the distant past. I have no idea who the kind man was (a curator presumably), but he played a big part in setting me on the road to a career in history. His message was clear \u2013 if you really wanted to explore the ancient world, there were people who would act as your guides; whether literally or metaphorically, museum cases could be opened.\nSo here I have chosen five objects from the Museum\u2019s collection to take out of their cases. It\u2019s been a tough choice out of the eight million there are (and I am already regretting not having some of the Roman soldiers\u2019 letters from Vindolanda near Hadrian\u2019s Wall, or a Lewis chessman, a replica of which has stood on my mantelpiece for decades).\nTrying to come down to a final five, I have gone not only for those with wow factor \u2013 but also those that challenge our assumptions, open our eyes, and encourage us to think differently about the world. For, partly at least, that challenge is what museums are for.\n1. Ancient Egyptian baking\nThree-cornered loaf of bread. Egypt.\nOf course, I have to start with that piece of cake. The truth is, as I have since discovered, that the British Museum has quite a collection of genuine foodstuffs from ancient Egypt, preserved in the hot dry sand (which has also preserved all those wonderful papyrus documents that have given us such vivid information about daily life there, from shopping lists to letters home from travellers). Anyway, I think that this is what I saw; it\u2019s identified as a piece of bread from around 2000 BC, found in excavations of a temple in the early twentieth century, not far from the modern town of Luxor.\n2. Michelangelo\u2019s Adam\nMichelangelo Buonarotti (1475\u20131564), studies of a reclining male nude: Adam in the fresco The Creation of Man on the vault of the Sistine Chapel. Dark red chalk over some stylus underdrawing, c. 1511.\nThis one really is wow factor. It\u2019s one of Michelangelo\u2019s preliminary chalk drawings for Adam on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, dated to 1511. We featured this in a recent BBC documentary on the Nude (The Shock of the Nude). We were lucky not only to film this (one of the most valuable drawings in the world \u2013 \u2018valuable\u2019 in all senses), but also to have former Museum Director, Neil MacGregor talk us through it.\nI remember Neil explaining that what was extraordinary here was the way Michelangelo made Adam\u2019s whole body expressive. Many artists can get expression and emotion out of, for example, hands or feet \u2013 but here Michelangelo can make even the muscles of the abdomen speak to us. 60 years on it was another eye-opening moment outside the case; but on this occasion we were able to share the fun with the TV viewers at home.\n3. Bronze head of the Roman emperor Augustus\nThe Mero\u00eb Head. Roman, 27\u201325 BC.\nA bronze head of the Roman emperor Augustus (who died in AD 14), and one of the classic images of Roman power. Here, as in all his other portraits, at whatever age, the emperor appears as a youthful image of perfection \u2013 parading the face of Roman rule to millions of his subjects across the Roman world. This is a rare specimen, partly because of the survival of his inlaid eyes (in most surviving ancient sculptures these have not survived, giving the subject a rather vacant expression).\nThe survival in this case is thanks to the unexpected find spot. For the head was discovered at the ancient city of Mero\u00eb, in what is now Sudan \u2013 it had been carefully buried under the steps leading up to a major temple. Mero\u00eb lay outside the borders of the Roman empire, and almost certainly this head was a trophy from a statue that the local people had destroyed on a raid into the Roman province of Egypt. That\u2019s partly what I mean by \u2018challenging assumptions\u2019. How unexpected is it that one of the most famous portraits we have of a Roman ruler actually survived, because it was the triumphant war loot of Rome\u2019s enemies?\n4. Lyme Regis Museum badge\nBadge depicting Mary Anning holding a tool next to a fossil, made by the Carole Group. Metal, paper and plastic, c. 1995.\nA reminder here that the Museum is not just full of precious, expensive, ancient objects. Part of the collection is the revealing bric-a-brac of modern times, the kind of thing that any one of us might have owned, that will become the history of the future. These include any number of cheap badges, celebrating political leaders from Ronald Reagan to Chairman Mao, warning of climate change, or acting as souvenirs of a visit to the Museum itself (\u2018Veni Vidi Museum Britannicum\u2019, runs one of my favourites; \u2018I\u2019ve been to the British Museum\u2019).\nBut I have chosen a souvenir from the Lyme Regis Museum in Dorset, decorated with the figure of local woman Mary Anning, the early-19th-century geologist and \u2018fossil hunter\u2019, who made all kinds of important discoveries in the area. She is one of the many women whose efforts, often unsung, underlie the collections in museums across the world. They are worth being taken out of their cases too!\n5. Brass head\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0Ooni\u00a0(king)\u00a0of\u00a0Ife\nBrass head of an Ooni (king) of Ife, Nigeria 1300s \u2013 early 1400s.\nThere\u2019s wow factor here too \u2013 the expertly modelled brass head of a man wearing an elegant headdress, once painted bright red (you can still see the traces). It was made in the 14th or 15th century in the ancient town of Ife, in Nigeria, and was found by accident along with a number of other brass heads during the course of house-building in the 1930s in the modern town. This one was bought by the editor of the Nigerian Daily Times, who took it to Britain; the rest remained in Nigeria (with copies now in the British Museum).\nIt goes without saying that these extraordinary works of art must have played an important part in Ife culture. But this one has opened people\u2019s eyes in the UK too. When it first went on display, critics almost refused to accept that it could be what it really was. So reluctant were they to believe that the people of Ife 600 years ago were \u2018capable\u2019 of making something of this quality, that they invented all kinds of tall tales (like they had with the \u2018Benin Bronzes\u2019) about them being made by Europeans. This head, in other words, has been a powerful challenge to common assumptions about cultural hierarchy, pulling the wool from the eyes of Western complacency about its own \u2018artistic superiority\u2019.\nThat thought, of course, raises all kinds of questions about where objects belong, who \u2018owns\u2019 them, and what their cultural purposes are (complicated questions often rolled up together under the title \u2018restitution\u2019). I have no doubt that, during my time at the Museum, the Trustees will be engaging with all these questions (indeed they already are), and I hope I can add a useful perspective of my own. But don\u2019t let\u2019s imagine that debates like this are new in the history of museums across the world.\nMuseums have always been controversial. Who should be allowed in? And on what terms? What should they put on display? Who has the right to choose? And many more. I guess that one job of a Trustee is to ensure that those debates continue \u2013 constructively.\nHave\u00a0you\u00a0been\u00a0inspired\u00a0by\u00a0objects\u00a0you\u2019ve\u00a0visited\u00a0in\u00a0museums\u00a0or\u00a0galleries?\nDo\u00a0you\u00a0have\u00a0a\u00a0favourite\u00a0object\u00a0with\u00a0an\u00a0inspirational\u00a0story?\nShare\u00a0it\u00a0with\u00a0us\u00a0by\u00a0tweeting\u00a0@britishmuseum."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/pushing-paper-an-introduction-to-contemporary-drawing/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Pushing paper: an introduction to contemporary drawing", "author": "Isabel Seligman, Bridget Riley Art Foundation Curator", "timestamp": "2020-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "The British Museum holds more than two million prints and 50,000 drawings in its collection. While lots of people know about the Museum\u2019s outstanding works by Rembrandt and D\u00fcrer, they might be less familiar with the contemporary parts of the collection. Pushing paper: contemporary drawing from 1970 to now is the Museum\u2019s first exhibition to focus on this aspect of the collection, selected from more than 1,500 contemporary works. It\u2019s been a real pleasure to bring these diverse and thought-provoking drawings to a wider audience around the UK as the show travels to Durham, Stromness, Swansea and Barnsley.\nIn the last 50 years, artists have continually pushed the boundaries of what a drawing can mean and be \u2013 radically redefining drawing in an \u2018expanded field\u2019 (a term coined by art historian Rosalind Krauss in 1979 referring to sculpture, but which applies equally well to the expansion of drawing practice during this period). While artists continue to use traditional tools like pen, pencil or brush, artists in this show also used processes such as burning, cutting, scratching, sticking, writing and sewing, and unusual materials from wax and gold to rattlesnake poison. Drawings were made using a stopwatch, by rolling dice, while blindfolded, or while walking. These works blur the boundaries between drawing and other mediums such as sculpture, land art and even performance.\nWhile some might not consider these works to be drawings at all, this exhibition shows how diverse the practice of drawing can be. The definition of what makes a drawing \u2018contemporary\u2019 is also up for grabs \u2013 while some might define this as work by artists who are alive, we decided to select artists whose work was made in the past 50 years, and still resonates with drawings made today. Now we\u2019ve discussed how the terms \u2018drawing\u2019 and \u2018contemporary\u2019 are themselves open to debate, let\u2019s explore some current themes in contemporary drawing.\nIdentity\nGrayson Perry (b. 1960), Untitled. Coloured crayons, watercolour, gouache, pen and ink, with collage of photographs, magazine illustrations and silver glitter, c.1984. \u00a9 Grayson Perry. \u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nContemporary artists have often used drawing to think through questions of identity. One of the most glittering works in the show (literally!) is an early drawing by British artist Grayson Perry, made with collage, crayons and silver glitter. While he is better known as a potter (we also have his ceramic works in the collection) this drawing was made long before he won the Turner Prize in 2003. This is one of the earliest representations of his transvestite alter-ego Claire, dressed in a hoodie and rah-rah skirt. While the photographs are roughly cut from magazines (like the feminine lingerie model, or the pendant nestling in manly chest hair) Claire is much more carefully drawn and seems to take a dim view of these clich\u00e9d symbols of normative gender.\nMarcia Kure (b. 1970), Power: The Players II. Gouache, kolanut pigment, pencil and watercolour on Arches watercolour paper, 2012. \u00a9 Marcia Kure. \u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nAnother artist who uses drawing to explore questions of identity is the Nigerian-American artist Marcia Kure. Contemporary artists have made drawings using unusual materials including make-up, hair and blood. As well as gouache and watercolour, Kure uses traditional pigments such as coffee and kolanut. She also uses elements typical of traditional Nigerian Uli art, practiced by Igbo women to decorate bodies and buildings, such as sinuous line and attention to negative space (there\u2019s no background to the figure in this drawing, for example). Kure\u2019s combination of colour, pattern and form suggests the way history and culture shape who we are, and having spoken about the difficulties of leaving Nigeria to live in America, the artist has described her work as \u2018an argument for people who do not have a defined place\u2019.\nPlace and space\nMinjung Kim (b. 1982) Mountain. Ink on hanji paper, 2009. \u00a9 Minjung Kim. \u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nContemporary artists have often used drawing to examine questions of place and space. South Korean artist Minjung Kim trained in the art of calligraphy for 15 years, getting to know the materials of ink and traditional mulberry paper (hanji) so well that she says \u2018today, I only have to touch the paper with my fingers to know how it will absorb the water, how the ink will spread on it, how the flame will burn it\u2019. In Mountain (2009), ink was brushed on while the paper was wet \u2013 bleeding upwards to create delicate tidelines which suggest a hilly landscape receding into the distance, but which could also suggest the ocean or soundwaves. Kim was inspired by a trip to southern Italy, but the drawing also recalls the mountainous landscape of South Korea, which she left more than 25 years ago to settle in Europe.\nLiliane Lijn (b. 1939), Hanging Gardens of Rock City. Collage of magazine cuttings touched with green crayon, on a support of a photograph of the New York skyline, 1970. \u00a9 Liliane Lijn. \u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nMeanwhile, this drawing by American artist Liliane Lijn was made as an idea for a project to create luxuriant walkways across the tops of the skyscrapers of Manhattan \u2013 a bit like the High Line public park, but nearly 40 years before it opened. Lijn doctored photographs of her hometown, collaging garlands of greenery and adding a haze of green crayon. Lijn has said \u2018I have always found the rooftops of the buildings in Manhattan exciting and strange as if their architects had allowed their fancies free at that distance from the ground\u2019. This drawing shows her desire to open up these rarefied spaces for all to enjoy.\nTime and memory\nJan Vanriet (b. 1948), Ruchla. Watercolour over black crayon with white gouache, 2011. \u00a9 Jan Vanriet. \u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nDrawing is an inherently time-based practice, as opposed to the instantaneousness of photography, for example, and it\u2019s no wonder that contemporary artists have used drawing to think about the workings of time and memory. One drawing concerned with the act of remembering, by Belgian artist Jan Vanriet, depicts Ruchla, a young girl who, along with more than 25,000 other people, was deported by the Nazis from Dossin barracks in Mechelen, Belgium, to the death camps of Auschwitz. The drawing is based on a black and white photograph, and is rendered in slightly acidic watercolour, the most fugitive (or light sensitive) of mediums. Details such as her open smile, and the broad ribbon pulling back her hair, attempt to restore her humanity in the face of the devastating scale of Nazi atrocities, offering a poignant and evocative memorial.\nMichael Ditchburn (b. 1991), One sat, another sitting. Graphite on paper, 2018. \u00a9 Michael Ditchburn. \u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nOne of the most recent drawings in the show is by the British artist Michael Ditchburn. It creates an uncanny sense of rhyming and repetition through the use of axonometric perspective. This system of perspective was developed by Asian artists hundreds of years before traditional linear perspective (sometimes called vanishing point perspective) was discovered in the 15th century. Things further away do not appear smaller, which makes you feel as if you\u2019re hovering at an uncertain distance from the drawing. The Department of Prints and Drawings acquired it at a recent show at Camberwell College of Arts and, along with canny acquisitions such as early drawings by Rachel Whiteread and Peter Doig \u2013 which are also on display \u2013 it was my inspiration to apply for an Art Fund New Collecting Award, which will now provide funding to acquire more drawings by emerging British artists.\nPower and protest\nHew Locke (b. 1959), Sovereign 3. Watercolour on Arches paper, 2005. \u00a9 Hew Locke. \u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nContemporary artists have often used drawing to engage with the world around them and to draw attention to systems \u2013 and abuses \u2013 of power. This drawing by British artist Hew Locke examines the role of the Queen as a symbol of nationhood and keeper of political secrets. Locke grew up in Georgetown, Guyana, which had achieved independence from the UK in 1966, but where the Queen\u2019s head still appeared on school exercise books, signs and statues. Drawn in acid greens and yellows and surrounded by gurning skulls, eyes and devils horns, this drawing prompts us to question the Queen and what she represents.\nEllen Gallagher (b. 1965), An Experiment of Unusual Opportunity. Graphite on handmade paper, 2008. \u00a9 Ellen Gallagher. \u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nThis work was made by the American artist Ellen Gallagher to draw attention to a gross injustice that was perpetrated in the name of science. The delicate strokes of pencil show a nurse\u2019s cap perched on an elaborate hairstyle, giving a clue to the profession of the person it commemorates \u2013 Eunice Rivers, a nurse who co-ordinated the Tuskegee Syphilis experiment. In 1932 she recruited 399 black men from Alabama who were denied treatment for syphilis so that doctors could observe the untreated progress of the disease, even after penicillin was found to cure it in the 1940s. The drawing is a study for Gallagher\u2019s \u2018medal of dishonour\u2019, seeking to bring to light this dark chapter of American history.\nSystems and process\nRoger Ackling (1947\u20132014), An hour walk along forest paths from one shaft of sunlight to the next/ Ashridge Hertfordshire/ May 1978 England. Sunlight on found wood, 1978. \u00a9 Roger Ackling. \u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nI really enjoyed finding out about some of the more experimental drawing processes represented in the collection, for example British artist Roger Ackling, who used a lens (like a magnifying glass) to burn marks into a piece of wood, \u2018drawing\u2019 on the wood with the heat of focused sunlight. The gaps between these marks are where he moved from one patch of sunlight to the next, under the shadow of tree branches or when a cloud passed over the sun. This way of thinking about drawing, as a way of recording how we spend time \u2013 or a way of translating experience \u2013 is perhaps suggested in its visual similarity to Morse code. Ackling used this particular system of working throughout his life \u2013 on driftwood, broken branches or other found objects, the particularities of time and place creating a great diversity and subtlety in his work while remaining dedicated to this particular process.\nKenneth Martin (1905\u20131984), Metamorphoses Blue. Blue and white gouache, ink and graphite on graph paper, c. 1973\u20131977. \u00a9 Kenneth Martin. \u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nKenneth Martin was known as one of the pioneers of kinetic art \u2013 art concerned with movement, especially gracefully moving sculptures. But he noted that his art was kinetic \u2018whether the result is still or moving\u2019 as they are concerned with change. He used rolls of a dice to dictate the lines in this drawing \u2013 creating a dynamic illustration of the workings of chance.\nCurators collaborate\nThis exhibition was the result of collaboration between five different museums and is a new way of working for the British Museum. Curators from Durham University (Alix Collingwood-Swinburn), the Pier Arts Centre in Stromness (Andrew Parkinson) the Glynn Vivian Gallery in Swansea (Katy Freer) and the Cooper Gallery in Barnsley (Alison Cooper) were all involved in the curation of the exhibition, from developing its themes and concepts to deciding which works would be included.\nThe process began with the partner curators visiting the British Museum to view works in the Departments of Prints and Drawings, Asia and the Middle East. After viewing drawings in the collection and using our database and Collection online to view other works, we discussed themes and currents in contemporary drawing, and decided which would be most relevant to our various audiences.\nThe decision process was aided by a giant spreadsheet listing all the drawings, and allowing each of the curators an equal number of votes on what should be in the show. Once the votes had been cast, we then got out all of the longlisted drawings in the gallery for a \u2018dummy run\u2019 to see which drawings worked in the gallery space, and spoke to each other. This allowed us to make connections both within each theme and between the different sections. This was a difficult process, with many fantastic drawings left on the cutting room floor. Don\u2019t worry though, when we re-open you can always make an appointment to come and see any of these in our Study Room (which is where you can see prints and drawings not on display in our exhibitions).\nOnce we had decided on the final works to be included in the show, each curator adopted a theme. Alix wrote about identity, Alison place and space, I looked at time and memory, Katy power and protest and Andrew systems and process. Each of the curators then came back to the Museum to research the works in their section, and write the exhibition labels and text for the book that accompanies the exhibition. The exhibition will now tour to each of the partner venues, and each museum will add works from their own collection to create a new version of the exhibition at each place, highlighting the diversity of contemporary works on paper nationwide.\nYou\u00a0can\u00a0buy\u00a0the\u00a0accompanying exhibition\u00a0book\u00a0from\u00a0Thames\u00a0and\u00a0Hudson\u00a0here.\nThe exhibition will be touring to:\nThe Oriental Museum, Durham\nThe Pier Arts Centre, Stromness\nThe Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea\nThe Cooper Gallery, Barnsley\nPlease note, the exhibition is temporarily closed in Durham.

Black chalk on brown paper, 1920\u20131962. Reproduced by permission of the artist\u2019s estate. \u00a9 Dorothy Hawksley\nBorn in London in 1884, Hawksley grew up in a large family \u2013 the fifth of eight children \u2013 with a history of artistic talent. Her mother Maria came from a family of maritime painters and Dorothy showed an early aptitude for drawing, enrolling in St John\u2019s Wood Art School at the age of 15. Here she undertook a rigorous artistic training. In 1906, she transferred to the Royal Academy Schools where she spent a further five years.\nDorothy Hawksley (1884\u20131970), study of foliage. Graphite and bodycolour, 1920\u20131970. Reproduced by permission of the artist\u2019s estate. \u00a9 Dorothy Hawksley\nAs an emerging artist, she became interested in Japanese prints and Chinese artists from the Song (960\u20131279) and Ming (1368\u20131644) periods. She absorbed these influences, creating work with an almost calligraphic precision and line, as seen in her studies of flowers and foliage.\nDorothy Hawksley (1884\u20131970), study of foliage. Graphite and bodycolour, 1920\u20131970. Reproduced by permission of the artist\u2019s estate. \u00a9 Dorothy Hawksley\nPost-Impressionists and the Aesthetic movement had been inspired by Japanese artworks before Hawksley, but she blended these styles with those of Renaissance Italy. Her subtle colour palette, floral motifs and graceful compositions could be said to echo those of Sandro Botticelli (1444/5\u20131510). Art historian William Connelly has researched Hawksley\u2019s early works and notes that she developed an interesting method of mixing tempera (egg-based paint) with watercolour to build up layers of wash with which to achieve subtle gradations of tone. She experimented with gold underpainting, as well as painting on silk, which combines techniques from both Japanese and Italian Renaissance works.\nDorothy Hawksley (1884\u20131970), Sir Sydney Cockerell. Graphite and watercolour, 1960. Reproduced by permission of the artist\u2019s estate. \u00a9 Dorothy Hawksley\nInsights into Hawksley\u2019s art can be drawn thanks to a collection of her work and papers acquired by the British Museum as part of the John Christian collection. John Christian\u2019s friendship with Hawksley was formed through Sir Sydney Cockerell \u2013 a former Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, portrayed above \u2013 who had known key figures in the 19th and 20th-century art world. Cockerell met Hawksley in 1917 when she was a successful professional artist, and she became a trusted friend who assisted him in his later years. It was during this time that art historian John Christian, then an enthusiastic student also began visiting Cockerell to hear his memories and ideas on 19th-century art.\nDorothy Hawksley (1884\u20131970), artist\u2019s working proof for The\u00a0Story\u00a0of\u00a0Jesus\u00a0According\u00a0to\u00a0St\u00a0Luke.

Reproduced by permission of the artist\u2019s estate. \u00a9 Dorothy Hawksley\nTheir friendship continued after Cockerell\u2019s death in 1962 and Hawksley handed down a rich archive of highly accomplished sketches, letters, reproductions, sources and an artist\u2019s working-proof copy of a children\u2019s book The Story of Jesus According to Saint Luke, shown above.\nCopies of books like this were used by artists and illustrators to mock up their ideas, and test schemes for the placement of images with text. In the image, Hawksley has used ink and wash to create the dramatic and atmospheric scene. A printed version was then created to be used in the final book.\nShe contributed to women\u2019s magazines and publications throughout her career, often integrating themes of the female body and maternity.\nTwo printed examples of Peace.

She was closely involved in the contemporary art world of her time, regularly exhibiting at the Royal Academy\u2019s Summer Exhibition, and was elected a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolour. However, her work and significance justify greater attention today \u2013 the acquisition of Hawksley\u2019s work and archive coincides with the timely reappraisal of the canon of art and interest in the careers and practice of women artists.\n\u2018For her, all effort and aspiration were focussed on what went on within the limits of a picture frame; everything else was irrelevant and beside the point.\u2018 \u2013 John Christian\nDorothy Hawksley (1884\u20131970), A\u00a0View\u00a0of\u00a0Venice.

Boots\nBoots are vital in the Arctic for keeping feet warm in cold temperatures and for allowing you to traverse ice and snow.\nThese beautiful boots are from the Gwich\u2019in People of northern Canada and Alaska. They are made from beaver fur and caribou hide and decorated with beading. The boot soles are made from moose hide that has been smoked over a fire to create a soft velvety leather, smelling of wood smoke.\n\nElizabeth Cadzou (1936\u20132019, Gwich\u2019in), boots. Moose hide, caribou hide, beaver fur, cotton, sinew, glass beads. Alaska, USA, 1993.\n2. Snow goggles\nThe intense sunlight reflecting off snow and ice, particularly in spring, can be very harmful and even cause blindness. To protect their eyes, Arctic Peoples have long fashioned their own snow spectacles. This Dolgan example from north-central Russia is made of reindeer skin. Decorated with beads, they were worn when riding reindeer across the taiga, the forests of the Arctic.\n\nMan\u2019s snow-spectacles. Reindeer skin, metal, glass beads, uranium beads. Dolgan, Russia, before 1879.\n3. A winter parka\nWarm clothing is essential to cope with the blistering cold during Arctic winters. This Inupiat coat, for a small child, was made by Nancy Myers of Kivalina, Alaska. She chose a number of different materials to make it both beautiful and cosy, showing her skill and knowledge of animal fur and materials. The hood, for example, is trimmed with wolverine fur, which doesn\u2019t freeze against the face as it doesn\u2019t absorb moisture.\nToddler\u2019s parka.

A sled\nSleds enable people to travel easily and for long distances. These hard-working vehicles need to be flexible enough to withstand the constant jostling of travelling across rough terrain.\nThis sled was made in the early 1800s by the Inughuit people of northern Greenland. The sled is made of narwhal and caribou bone, willow and spruce driftwood, and sealskin. It is an excellent example of the technological innovation of Arctic Peoples, despite limited materials, as they scavenge wood and waste nothing from the animals they hunt.\nSled made of bone, ivory, wood and seal skin and sinew. Inughuit, Greenland, about 1818.\n5. Needles and a needle case\n\nIn the Arctic, warm tailored clothing is essential for survival. The earliest Arctic innovations came with the needle 30,000 years ago. This enabled people to sew and mend well-fitted clothing that allowed the wearer to stay warm and to move around easily.\nThis needle case from the mid-19th century secured a woman\u2019s precious needles so they would not get lost or broken. Such cases were attached to a belt along with other sewing tools.\nIvory needle case. Yupiit or Inupiat, USA, before 1855.\n6. An ulu\nUlus are multipurpose tools, used for slicing meat, skinning animals and even cutting fabrics. While regional styles and materials vary, all ulus share the elegant crescent shape designed to reduce wrist fatigue during long hours of processing food and hides. This ulu has a copper blade and musk ox horn handle.\n\nCopper and horn ulu. Inuit, Canada, before 1835.\n7. Waterproofs\nWaterproofs, like this parka made from seal gut, help the wearer stay dry. They serve various functional, decorative and ceremonial purposes. In the past, gut parkas were used for kayaking, so that even in bad weather or in the event of capsizing, the wearer would stay dry.\nThis parka from western Alaska, was made and used by its owner, Flora Nanuk, for berry picking, keeping her dry when it rained and protecting her from being bitten by the mosquitos of the summer tundra.\nFlora Nanuk (1925\u20132004, Yupiit), women\u2019s gut parka. Bearded seal gut and colon, beach grass. Hooper Bay, Alaska, USA, 1980s.\n8. Knife and pouch\n\nKnives are one of the most important tools for reindeer herders. Men use them to castrate and slaughter reindeer and, in the past, to score their unique ownership marks onto their reindeer\u2019s ears. This knife from Russia hangs from a belt, which also held bags containing personal amulets, fire starters and tobacco.\nBelt with knife and bag, made of reindeer fur, cloth, metal and wood. Khanty or Nenets, Russia, before 1898.\n9. Cooking equipment\nAnimals continue to be the main source of food and materials for many Arctic Peoples. Fish and meat are prepared in a variety of ways in the Arctic. Before propane stoves were used, Inuit boiled food in soapstone kettles, like this one, over a flame. But kettles and other vessels were also essential for melting ice into drinking water.\nSoapstone kettle. Inuit, Canada, before 1904.\n10. Guardian spirit figure\nAlong with practical items, spiritual help has also been called on by Arctic Peoples to help survive in the Arctic. This wooden figure embellished with beaded eyes and mouth and ermine or sable hide clothing was a personal guardian spirit that protected households. It was made and used by Evenki People of north-central Siberia.\nGuardian spirit figure made of wood, glass beads and hide.

It was in poor condition, with light-damaged silk borders and flaking paint, so it needed to be treated by conservators before it could be displayed safely in the upcoming exhibition Tantra: enlightenment to revolution (24 September 2020 \u2013 24 January 2021). During conservation, an exciting prospect arose to also carry out scientific analysis to find out more about this devotional object and its origins.\nThangka depicting the Mahasiddha Saraha, after conservation.\nThangkas are portable sacred objects with a central painted image, usually painted on a cotton fabric prepared with a ground layer, surrounded by highly decorative silk brocade borders. Wooden rods are attached to the top and bottom to allow for hanging and a silk veil protects the image. Thangkas are traditionally stored rolled and then unrolled for display \u2013 this causes damage to the paint layer and textile over time.\nThis thangka depicts the Mahasiddha Saraha \u2013 who you can find out more about in our \u2018What is Tantra\u2019 blog. Unusually, this thangka has a stupa (Buddhist shrine) painted on the back and a set of hand prints from when it was consecrated.\nTeresa Heady and Alice Derham removing the silk borders.\nAs religious objects, thangkas require utmost care and respect during conservation treatment. In the past, original brocade borders were sometimes removed from thangka paintings by art dealers, and in some cases paintings were restored using techniques traditionally used for easel paintings. At the British Museum, we take a holistic approach to treating thangkas and use contemporary conservation techniques from both East Asian Art and textile conservation disciplines.\nThe first step in the treatment of the thangka was to carefully unpick the stitching that joins the silk brocade border to the painting. The borders were then separated from the painting so the fragile silk could be stabilised. To our delight, this revealed colourful pigment tests in the margins around the painting.\nPigment tests in the margins of the thangka painting.\nDuring preliminary examinations of the painting we observed extensive underdrawing in areas where the pigment had been lost. Scientific imaging was carried out to investigate the full underdrawings, as well as to determine the nature of the pigments in the painting and how they related to the pigment tests in the margins. This was a unique opportunity that will not be possible after the textile borders are reattached. Through a combined approach of multispectral imaging (visible, ultraviolet-induced visible luminescence, infrared-reflected, infrared-reflected false-colour) followed by non-invasive analysis it was found that the palette was in-line with traditional thangka painting practices of the 17th and 18th centuries.\nThe red pigments (red lead and cinnabar) were transparent in the infrared-reflected image, so it was possible to \u2018see\u2019 the carbon-based paint underdrawings below the painted surface. In the image below you can see how the folds of the fabric on the left arm of the figure have been changed in the final painting.\nDetail from the visible and infrared-reflected images of the thangka, showing a revision of the underdrawing beneath the red paint layer.\nFurther reworkings were revealed using X-radiography, which uses a source of radiation that penetrates even further beneath the paint layers than infrared light. In the X-ray image below, two sets of gold lines can be seen radiating from the Mahasiddaha Saraha, indicating that the artist chose to cover up the first set of lines with blue azurite pigment and then apply new gold lines in a more upward direction. You can also see the broad brush strokes used to apply the fluid red pigment, as well as the stupa from the back of the painting.\n\nDetail from the visible image and X-Radiograph of the thangka. The latter shows two sets of gold lines radiating from the Mahasiddha Saraha.\nFollowing scientific analysis, pigment consolidation was carried out to re-adhere any loose or lifting media to the cloth support below. The powdery pigments were stabilised by applying a synthetic cellulose-based adhesive ( Bermocoll\u00ae \u2013 ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose) as a fine mist, using an air-brush spray. Under the microscope, a slightly higher concentration of the same adhesive was applied with a tiny brush to adhere loose flakes of paint.\nConsolidating unstable pigments under the microscope.\nSome areas of the light-damaged textile were splitting and very weak, so these areas were sandwiched between two different support materials \u2013 hand-dyed silk crepeline and a fine nylon netting, which were coated in advance with a synthetic heat-set adhesive (Lascaux 498). The crepeline was inserted behind each damaged area and attached to the textile by applying heat with a spatula, and then the fine nylon netting was placed on top of the damaged area and attached in the same way. Some stitching was worked through all three layers to ensure the repairs would withstand future rolling and unrolling of the textile. To complete the treatment, the border and painting were stitched back together.\nReattaching the silk borders to the painting using a long running-stitch.\nDuring treatment it was possible to see the inside of the border, where the dyes used to colour the textile remain as bright as they would have looked originally before extensive fading. Dye analysis revealed that light-sensitive natural dyes, including safflower, indigo, pagoda, sappanwood and probably turmeric, often in combination, were used to create the vivid colour scheme. To ensure that the dyes do not fade further, the thangka will be on display for a limited period of time only, at low light levels (below 50 lux).\nLight-sensitive natural dyes on the reverse side of the silk borders.\nAll of these elements of close interdisciplinary study and examination were crucial in planning and carrying out an effective treatment of this sacred piece.

Staff across the museum work together to rid the galleries and stores of this dusty danger, helping to preserve and protect the collection.\nLayers of dust can obviously affect an object\u2019s appearance, but dust can do more than just impact on the looks of an object. Dust poses a health threat to humans, and can also be a risk to museum collections.\nConservation teams working on the 12-metre-tall Totem Poles in the Great Court.\nDust has been identified as one of the \u2018ten agents of deterioration\u2019 that can cause damage to museum collections. It doesn\u2019t just affect the aesthetics of the collections, but in combination with other environmental factors (temperature and relative humidity) it has the potential to cause serious damage to objects. This is especially true for objects outside display cases like the Totem Poles in the Great Court. But first, let\u2019s take a look at what dust actually is.\nWhat is dust?\nA sample of dust as seen under the Scanning Electron Microscope, magnified 30 times.\nWe can define dust as particulate matter that can be suspended in the air. The sizes of these particles vary from really small with a diameter of less than one micrometre (\u03bcm, which is one thousandth of a millimetre), to larger particles with a diameter of 20 \u03bcm or more. The components of this particulate matter vary greatly and can have organic sources (originating from people, animals, plants and insects etc.) or inorganic sources (for example plastics, silt or metal particles). Dust can be composed of many different things \u2013 keep reading to find out what we\u2019ve found lurking in the microscopic world of dust at the Museum.\nHow can dust damage collections?\nPreventive Conservator Fabiana Portoni collecting a sample of dust in the Great Court.\nDamage to objects can happen in a variety of different ways. Dust particles can get ingrained in objects over time, making it extremely time consuming to remove without damaging the surface material. Organic and particularly inorganic dust particles can also be abrasive to the object\u2019s surface, meaning that they slowly wear away the material underneath. Dust particles are hygroscopic (i.e. they absorb water from the air), which can corrode metallic objects. It can also contain mould spores which can thrive in certain temperature and humidity conditions. Mould can stain material surfaces as well as affect their structural stability, and mould spores are also a health and safety concern for people accessing the collections.\nLastly, dust and debris with organic particles in can be a source of food for insect pests that could cause damage with their activity. Common insect pests in a museum setting might be the webbing clothes moth Tineola bisselliella and carpet beetles Anthrenus and Anthrenocerus.\nKnowing what type of dust is present, as well as its source, is useful so we can prevent or mitigate its potential damage as much as possible. Using different scientific tools we are able to be transported into a fascinating microscopic world and see what hides behind that familiar layer of dust.\nHow do we analyse dust at the Museum?\nCollection Care Student Sindy Mak takes a slide with the sample of dust from the base of the Totem pole.\nFirst we need to sample the dust. We do this by using carbon-based, electrically conductive, double-sided adhesive discs on microscope slides to collect the dust that will then be analysed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). We then place the glass slides either on the object or on the plinths surrounding the object \u2013 eagle-eyed visitors may have seen some of these around the Museum. After four weeks, we collect them and take them to be analysed in the lab.\nScientist Laura Perucchetti shows Sindy and Fabiana close-ups of the dust samples.\nBehind the scenes in one of the Scientific Research laboratories, we analyse the dust samples using the SEM. The SEM can produce high-resolution images by scanning the surface of the sample with a focused beam of electrons. This gives us a lot of information about the topography (features on the surface) of the samples and can see details down to about 5 nanometres (nm). This means that we can see very small insects or grains of pollen in a lot of detail. The SEM can also be paired with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX), which allows us to identify the chemical elements present in the samples so we can tell if a small piece of something that looks like a seed might actually be a piece of metal.\nWhat does dust look like under the microscope?\nLooking at the samples under the SEM allows us to see dust in a new light, and reveals so much more than we can see with the naked eye. Some images can be easy to recognise \u2013 like insects or fibres \u2013 but others were surprising. Small things can look very different up close! Have a look and see if you would recognise our findings.\nWhat looks like a little creature is actually a cotton fibre.\nWe initially thought this small fragment was a seed, but it\u2019s really a very small piece of aluminium.\nThis is what a small part of a feather looks like magnified 100 times!\nWe contacted Adie Doyle, who is responsible for Integrated Pest Management in the Museum, and consultant entomologist and museum pest expert David Pinniger to confirm the type of insect we saw here. David confirmed it looked like a mite, but it was a bit too squished to confirm the exact species. It was also missing some legs, but that is common when we find insect evidence around the Museum.\nThis small blob is what an example of pollen looks like under the microscope, magnified 1,000 times.\nHere is a small sample of skin found on one of our slides.\nAnd finally, an insect\u2019s wing shown under 300 times magnification.\nThe work we do at the museum to protect the collection from dust is a good example of collaborative work across the institution. It requires several departments and colleagues to work together to identify its constituents, understand the risks associated with the particulates present, and work on different strategies to mitigate against them.\nTop ten tips for keeping your home dust-free\nIf all this talk of dust has got you preparing for a spring clean, we\u2019ve compiled our best advice to keep your home and any artworks free from dust!\nFrame your work\nDisplay art in a closed cabinet or sealed case\nMove it away from an open window\nHave an entrance mat to remove dirt from your shoes\nClean and vacuum the nearby area regularly\nUse a dry, soft brush to carefully dust off a sculpture or painting\nUse a damp microfibre cloth to gently wipe off dirt or stains and then a dry cloth to remove moisture from a ceramic surface\nUse a dry, soft brush to remove dust or a small air brush to blow away any dirt from a photograph or print\nUse a vacuum with adjustable suction and small nozzle on your tapestry or textile through a mesh screen\nRead The National Trust Manual of Housekeeping for more comprehensive information!\nYou can read our colleagues\u2019 blog posts to find out how we go about removing dust from objects \u2013 for example an 18th-century suit of samurai armour, or on D\u00fcrer\u2019s monumental Triumphal Arch print."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/100-years-of-science-and-conservation/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "100 years of science and conservation", "author": "Carl Heron, Director of Scientific Research and Sandra Smith, Head of Collection Care", "timestamp": "2020-02-12 00:00:00", "text": "2020 marks 100 years since the creation of the \u2018Research Laboratory\u2019 \u2013 a space for developing and conducting scientific research and conservation on the British Museum collection.

We hope you enjoy them. Please keep an eye out over the coming months as we share recent conservation success stories, the latest applications of scientific research and report news of the latest work from both the Scientific Research and Collection Care teams.\nCarl Heron, Director of Scientific Research and Sandra Smith, Head of Collection Care\nBreaking down black \u2018goo\u2019\nResearch Assistant Dr Kate Fulcher\u2019s analysis of the mysterious black \u2018goo\u2019 found in ancient Egyptian coffins, on the Museum podcast, makes for compelling listening. After analysing \u201ccrumbly black stuff\u201d (her words) found in tombs at Amara West for her PhD, Kate was inspired to continue looking into unusual funerary substances, and so began to research mummy goo.\nThe goo \u2013 a black liquid that was applied to coffins during funerals \u2013 was poured over the outside of the coffin, the mummy case (the box between the mummy and the coffin), or the wrapped body itself. In some cases, the dead person had only a small amount of goo poured onto their face, in others a large amount was poured into their coffin.\nMummy of Pedihorpakhered in wooden coffin. Thebes, Egypt, 22nd dynasty (945 \u2013 720 BC).\nGas Chromatography\u2013Mass Spectrometry (a type of chemical analysis) revealed that the goo is made up of plant oils, animal fat, beeswax and bitumen. The analysis was performed on tiny samples, so Kate and her team were able to understand the components of the goo while still leaving the coffins entirely intact.\nMummy of Djedkhonsiufankh in wooden coffin. Egypt, 22nd dynasty (945 \u2013 720 BC)\nYou can hear more about Kate\u2019s work on black goo in the May episode of the Museum podcast, or read her blog here.\nKate\u2019s research is funded by the Wellcome Trust.\nExploring X-rays\nNot many people know that the Museum has its very own X-ray lab, headed up by Dr Dan O\u2019Flynn \u2013 X-ray Imaging Scientist and self-styled Curator of Photons. It sits four floors down, in the bowels of the Museum, and was purpose-built with extra-thick walls to prevent X-rays leaking into the building. An incredible six metres tall, the X-ray room itself is large enough to house even the largest objects in the collection and the equipment can support weights of up to 2,000kg.\nDr Dan O\u2019Flynn at work in the Museum\u2019s X-ray lab.\nDan\u2019s findings include information about the assembly of the Townley Discobolus, showing how the limbs of the 800kg ancient Roman statue were attached to the body. This information is particularly pertinent to the statue\u2019s outstretched throwing arm which comprises several fragments joined together and is otherwise unsupported. Identifying if and where metal dowels have been used inside a joint means that the stability of the object can confidently be assessed. This helps conservators determine what treatment the object requires so they can ensure its safety for future display.\nThe Townley Discobolus in the X-ray room.\nBut it\u2019s not just large objects that benefit from a trip to Dan\u2019s lair; X-ray imaging has revealed mummified snakes hiding inside an ornately wrapped ancient Egyptian bundle, the cuneiform writing on a 4,000 year-old tablet sealed in clay, and even the contents of a Kinder Surprise.\nYou can hear more about what it\u2019s like in the X-ray lab on the September 2019 episode of the Museum podcast.\nCT-scanning Afghan sculptures\nAt the end of 2019, curator St John Simpson told us how the Museum is helping to identify and return looted objects to Afghanistan, Iraq and Uzbekistan. Among the 2,345 objects that the Museum has helped to return over the past decade are a group of Buddhist sculptures from Afghanistan. Seized as part of an operation involving the Art and Antiques Unit of the Metropolitan Police, the sculptures were brought to the Museum for identification. They date from between the fourth and sixth centuries AD, when Buddhism was the main religion in Afghanistan.\n\nSeized Buddhist sculptures on temporary display in Room 53.\nSt John explained how scientific analysis \u2013 carried out by Dr Joanne Dyer \u2013 of the 1,500-year-old stone sculptures revealed the nature of the pigments used on the objects\u2019 heads. Through this work we were able to ascertain that the red pigment was made from iron-rich ore and applied over a carbon black layer to deepen the colour. The sculptures were also CT-scanned to determine how the heads were made. The scans revealed a two-layered construction: a centre of coarse clay, overlaid with a finer and more compact material which was then painted.\n(L) Moulded and painted clay head of a female bodhisattva wearing a diadem (crown).\n(R) Image highlighting the red pigment.\nDecoding ancient tattoos\nIn 2018 the Museum made headlines around the world with the discovery of the oldest figurative tattoos in the world. Curator of Bioarchaeology Daniel Antoine (who works closely with the Department of Scientific Research) and his team used infrared scanning of two 5,000-year-old natural mummies \u2013 known as \u2018Gebelein Man A\u2019 and \u2018Gebelein Woman\u2019 \u2013 to reveal a range of tattoos on the pair.\nCurator of Bioarchaeology Daniel Antoine explains how his team discovered the earliest known figurative tattoos in the world.\nBoth mummies were discovered around 100 years ago, but the markings on the pair remained unexamined. When Daniel\u2019s team re-examined them for signs of body modification, they found that Gebelein Man A has a tattoo of two horned animals on his arm. These have been identified as a bull and a Barbary sheep.\nDetail of S-shaped tattoos on the Predynastic female mummy from Gebelein.\nThe Gebelein Woman has a series of \u2018S\u2019 shapes on her shoulder \u2013 a motif also found on pottery of the same period. Below it, on her arm, is a linear design, perhaps a baton for a ritual dance or a crooked stave, symbolising power.\nMore science and conservation stories\nWe\u2019ll be sharing our favourite Conservation projects and revealing new work from both the Department of Scientific Research and the Department of Collection Care over the coming year. Stay tuned to find out more about the amazing work that goes on behind the scenes here at the Museum to help us care for the collection and continue uncovering stories from history.\nIf you\u2019d like to find out more about any of the terms used in this blog, head to our Scientific Research, Care of Collection and Conservation glossary.\nRead more about recent scientific research on our website here."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/disposable-cups-and-recycled-exhibitions/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Disposable cups and recycled exhibitions", "author": "Kayte McSweeney, Community Partnerships Manager and Julia Farley, Curator, British and European Iron Age Collections", "timestamp": "2020-02-11 00:00:00", "text": "The current Asahi Shimbun Displays, Disposable? Rubbish and us, begins with two very different disposable cups. Disposable and single-use objects are about convenience, but they\u2019re also more than that. Investing valuable labour and resources in things that may only be used once can be a way to show off wealth, power and status.\nA single-use cup made for Air India by a company in Finland.\nThe one cup shown above may well be familiar \u2013 a small waxed-paper cup which displays the logo of Air India. It was used for serving hot drinks on flights and at airports, and was acquired by a British Museum curator travelling through Delhi in 1991. But, rather than being made in India, the cup was commissioned from a company in Finland. The logo style also speaks to the global trend for minimalist design in the early 1990s. Together these international connections helped to position the airline as a global brand.\nThe other cup is perhaps more surprising \u2013 it was made on Crete during the Minoan period around 3,500 years ago. Looking closely at the cup shows that it has been hastily made. It was turned on a potter\u2019s wheel, and the finger impressions of the maker are still visible inside. The bottom is uneven where string or wire, used to take it off the wheel, has cut into the base on the first attempt.\nSingle-use clay cups like this were made for feasts and celebrations on the island of Crete.\nThousands of these cups were made, often in quite a standard shape and size. They are found in large dumps, sometimes of hundreds of cups, at palaces like Knossos \u2013 urban centres with a main building known as a \u2018palace\u2019. They are often thrown away in one piece \u2013 they could have been used again, but were discarded instead.\nWe know that large numbers of people gathered at Minoan palaces for celebrations, festivals and feasts. While simple fired-clay cups like these could have had many uses, their low-effort production, standardised size, the places they were used and the way they were dumped all suggest that many were designed to be disposable \u2013 used to serve wine to guests, and thrown away at the end of the event. Other ancient societies, including cities in Bronze Age India, also used single-use clay cups. Many present-day communities in North India and Pakistan use similar disposable \u2018kulhar\u2019 cups for serving tea and yoghurt, but these are increasingly giving way to plastic-coated paper cups.\nTwo disposable cups made 3,500 years apart.\nToday, we are more and more concerned about the impact of disposable objects, and for good reason \u2013 the materials used and the scale of production have changed dramatically in the last 3,500 years. Disposable cups made from clay will have little environmental effect when they are thrown away, whereas plastic or plastic-coated paper will take decades or even centuries to biodegrade, and may even break down into microplastics which can enter the food chain if they are not disposed of properly.\nAncient societies were also not producing anything like the quantity of disposable cups that we do. Over 300 billion disposable paper cups are now made globally every year, and even more single-use plastic cups. These levels of production and consumption are unsustainable, not just because of the vast amount of waste they generate, but also the materials required and carbon emissions from the manufacturing process. Modern paper cup production uses millions of trees and billions of gallons of water every year.\nA selection of infographics on display in the exhibition.\nWe all have a part to play in this international problem. At the British Museum, we are committed to reducing our environmental impact. Last year we had over 6.2 million visitors, and providing refreshments to thirsty Museum-goers is essential. As part of the research for this exhibition we spoke to Benugo, the Museum\u2019s catering partner, about the disposable cups that are used in our caf\u00e9s and restaurants. In 2018, Benugo served over a million hot drinks at the Museum. They use ceramic cups wherever possible, and encourage visitors to bring reusable cups if they can, but in busy areas and for visitors who have travelled a long way to reach us, these solutions are less likely to work. 630,000 disposable cups were used at the Museum in 2018.\nThe Great Court Restaurant.\nWherever possible, Benugo source packaging made from recycled materials and recycle the waste that we produce, but it is very hard to recycle paper cups \u2013 the plastic lining which makes them waterproof is difficult to separate from the paper. None of the waste from the British Museum goes to landfill, and all our non-recyclable rubbish is collected and compacted on site to reduce the number of lorry collections needed. To further reduce emissions, the waste is shipped by barge along the River Thames to an energy recovery facility, where it is incinerated. The energy produced is then sent to the National Grid. In 2018, energy recovered through the Museum\u2019s waste operation was enough to power 223 UK homes for a month.\nInside the Asahi Shimbun Displays Disposable?\u00a0Rubbish\u00a0and\u00a0us showing the recycled and re-purposed exhibition build.\nThe Disposable exhibition itself was also built from recycled materials. The design team worked hard to find materials and equipment which could be given a second life, and the designer\u2019s idea was not to use any new materials. All of the display cases and plinths were repurposed from last year\u2019s major exhibition on manga, and the labels were screen-printed onto paper cut from the banners that originally hung in the Great Court .\nThese small steps are part of a much bigger global conversation about more sustainable and environmentally conscious production, consumption and disposal. Creating rubbish is an unavoidable by-product of being human, but the choices we make, and the actions we take to reduce waste are more important now than ever before.\nYou can see the Asahi Shimbun Displays Disposable?\u00a0Rubbish\u00a0and\u00a0us in Room 3 until 23 February 2020."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/what-is-tantra/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "What is Tantra?", "author": "Imma Ramos, Curator of South Asia", "timestamp": "2020-01-23 00:00:00", "text": "From its inception to the present day, Tantra has challenged religious, cultural and political norms around the world. A philosophy that emerged in India around the sixth century, Tantra has been linked to successive waves of revolutionary thought, from its early transformation of Hinduism and Buddhism, to the Indian fight for independence and the rise of 1960s counterculture.\nThe Sanskrit word \u2018Tantra\u2019 derives from the verbal root\u00a0tan, meaning \u2018to weave\u2019, or \u2018compose\u2019, and refers to a type of instructional text, often written as a dialogue between a god and a goddess. The exhibition features some of the earliest surviving Tantras (see image below). These outline a variety of rituals for invoking one of the many all-powerful Tantric deities, including through visualisations and yoga. Requiring guidance from a teacher, or guru, they were said to grant worldly and supernatural powers, from long life to flight, alongside spiritual transformation.\nFolio from the Vajramrita Tantra (Nectar of the Thunderbolt Tantra). Palm leaf, Nepal, 1162. \u00a9 Cambridge University Library.\nMany texts contained rituals that transgressed existing social and religious boundaries \u2013 for example, sexual rites and engagement with the taboo, such as intoxicants and human remains. Tantra challenged distinctions between opposites by teaching that everything is sacred, including the traditionally profane and impure.\nThe rise of Tantra\nThe development of Tantra in medieval India coincided with the rise of\u00a0many new kingdoms across the subcontinent after the breakdown of two major dynasties, the Guptas in the north and the Vakatakas in the southwest. Although this led to political precariousness, there was also a great flourishing of the arts. Many rulers were drawn to Tantra\u2019s promise of power and public temples often incorporated Tantric deities as guardians.\nGranite sculpture of the god Bhairava, Tamil Nadu, India, 11th century.\nThis included the Tantric Hindu god Bhairava, seen above. He famously decapitated the orthodox creator god Brahma to show the superiority of the Tantric path and used his skull as a begging bowl. Early Tantric practitioners (Tantrikas) emulated his fearsome and anarchic appearance in order to \u2018become\u2019 him, while rulers worshipped him in order to strengthen their political positions.\nOne of his early followers was the poet-saint Karaikkal Ammaiyar, who abandoned her role as an obedient wife to become his follower. Tantric initiation was open to people from different social backgrounds. This challenge to the caste system made Tantra especially appealing to women and the socially marginalised.\nBronze sculpture of Karaikkal Ammaiyar, Tamil Nadu, India, late 13th century.\n\u00a9 Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\nDivine feminine power\nThe Tantric worldview sees all material reality as animated by Shakti \u2013 unlimited, divine feminine power. This inspired the dramatic rise of goddess worship in medieval India. Tantric goddesses challenged traditional models of womanhood as passive and docile in their intertwining of violent and erotic power.\u00a0Their characteristics were tied to a uniquely Tantric tension between the destructive and the maternal.\nGranite sculpture of a Yogini goddess, Tamil Nadu, India, 10th century AD.\nThe seductive but dangerous Yoginis were shapeshifting goddesses who could metamorphose into women, birds, tigers or jackals as the mood took them. Initiated Tantrikas sought to access their powers, from flight and immortality to control over others. The Yogini above is part of a group that would have once been enshrined in a Yogini temple. Her earrings are made of a dismembered hand and a cobra, and she has fangs.\nThe Yoginis were believed to offer protection to kingdoms against epidemics or enemy forces and assist in the acquisition of new territories. Most Yogini temples were circular and unique in their roofless design \u2013 you can see an example below. The exhibition will feature an immersive and imaginative recreation of this space.\nSixty-four Yoginis encircle the interior walls of a 10th-century temple in Hirapur, Odisha, Eastern India.\nTantric yoga\nThe allure of Tantra, with its promise of longevity and invulnerability, retained a hold over those in positions of power between the 16th and 19th centuries, including Rajput, Mughal and Sultanate rulers. One form of Tantric practice that became especially popular was Hatha yoga (\u2018yoga of force\u2019).\nYogis used complex postures and muscular contractions to direct the flow of breath. Techniques included visualising the goddess Kundalini, an individual\u2019s source of Shakti, as a serpent at the base of the spine. Around her is a network of energy centres known as\u00a0chakras, each of which contains a deity. Together, they make up the \u2018yogic body\u2019. Through breath control, Kundalini rises like a current, infusing the\u00a0chakras\u00a0with power. Awakening Kundalini became the practitioner\u2019s ultimate goal. This is what is being visualised in the painting below, a loan from the British Library. This is very much about\u00a0transformation\u00a0in\u00a0the world, via the body, rather than\u00a0transcendence\u00a0of it.\nPage from Hatha yoga manuscript depicting the \u2018yogic body\u2019. India, early 19th century.\n\u00a9 British Library.\nThe spread of Tantra across Asia\nAlso known as Vajrayana, the \u2018Path of the Thunderbolt\u2019, Tantric Buddhism flourished in Eastern India. Buddhist monasteries studied and taught the\u00a0Tantras,\u00a0and attracted pilgrims from across Asia. This led to the rapid transmission of Vajrayana teachings. Tibet saw the founding of major monasteries which became the new political players and often rivalled one another.\nInstrumental in the transmission of Tantric teachings from India to the Himalayas were the Mahasiddhas or Great Accomplished Ones. Their life stories are filled with miraculous events and they became especially popular in Tibet. Many engaged in sexual rites and carried out practices involving impure substances in cremation ground settings. Their goal was to confront limiting emotions such as attachment, fear and disgust. Most are shown as semi-naked and shaggy-haired yogis. Some carry skull-cups and wear human bone ornaments to imitate Tantric deities. Six are shown here, including Saraha in the centre. He holds an arrow, symbolic of single-minded concentration and a reference to his guru, who was a female arrow-smith.\nThangka (painting on textile) depicting Saraha and other Mahasiddhas, Tibet, 18th century.\nOne of the themes the exhibition explores is the role of divine union. Tantric Buddhist texts and images use gender to articulate the two qualities to be cultivated on the path towards enlightenment, wisdom and compassion. These are visualised as a goddess (representing wisdom) and a god (representing compassion) in sexual union, as we see with this Tibetan bronze. In Tibet this is known as yab-yum or father-mother. The goal is to internalise these qualities by visualising the deities uniting within the body through meditation.\nSculpture of Raktayamari in union with Vajravetali. Bronze with turquoise, gold and pigment, Tibet, 16\u201317th century.\nTantra and revolution in colonial India\nThe Tantric goddess Kali was widely worshipped in Bengal. She\u00a0was heralded as\u00a0a ruthless yet compassionate Mother\u00a0by the\u00a0Bengali mystic and poet, Ramprasad Sen.\u00a0His verse resonated at a time of crisis in Bengal, intensified by the rise of the British East India Company.\u00a0Devotion to Kali as an icon of strength increased, promoted through poetry and public festivals.\nPrint of Ramprasad Sen with the goddess Kali, signed P. Chakraborty, Bengal, India, 20th-century.\nKali was regarded by many British officials as a threat to the colonial enterprise, and Bengali revolutionaries effectively exploited these fears by reimagining her as a symbol of resistance and a manifestation of India personified.\u00a0This is evident in prints produced by printmakers such as the Calcutta Art Studio, established in 1878.\u00a0The example below continued to circulate after 1905, when Bengal was partitioned by the British to weaken the growing\u00a0independence movement. A colonial administrator identified the decapitated heads in this print as suspiciously British-looking, leading to its censorship.\nPopular print of the goddess Kali, published by the Calcutta Art Studio. Lithograph, Kolkata, Bengal, India, c. 1885\u20131895.\nThe art of Tantra\nBoth before and after Indian independence from British rule in 1947 and the emergence of India and Pakistan as independent nation states, South Asian artists forged modern national styles rooted in the pre-colonial art of the past. Many were inspired by Tantra\u2019s engagement with social inclusivity and spiritual freedom. In the 1970s, artists associated with the Neo-Tantra movement adopted certain Tantric symbols and adapted them to speak to the visual language of global modernism, particularly Abstract Expressionism.\nBiren De (1926\u20132011), Untitled. Acrylic on canvas, 1974. \u00a9 Biren De.\nThe painting above by Bangladeshi artist Biren De reflects the influence of the concentric shapes of\u00a0mandalas, which frame luminous central deities. This centre point is also understood as an expression of cosmic creation.\nTantra in the UK and the US\nIn the UK and the US in the 1960s and 1970s, Tantra had an impact on the period\u2019s radical politics, where it was interpreted as a movement that could inspire anti-capitalist, ecological and free love ideals. Tantra was reimagined as a \u2018cult of ecstasy\u2019 that could challenge stifled attitudes to sexuality. Here a pair of London-based designers draw on Tantric images of deities in union\u00a0to communicate this idea.\nHapshash and the Coloured Coat (Nigel Waymouth, b. 1971 and Michael English, 1942\u20132009), Tantric Lovers.\u00a0Pull-out poster from Oz Magazine, London, 1968.\nAnother poster\u00a0advertises the Human Be-In festival, held in San Francisco, which heralded the summer of love in 1967. Yoga and meditation were promoted as transformative practices that could inspire minds to challenge the status quo.

USA, 1967.\nTantra today\nToday, 200 years of shifting interpretations have left many misconceptions about what Tantra is, or what it actually involves. Tantra is not independent of Hinduism and Buddhism but has pervaded and transformed both traditions from its inception. As a worldview, philosophy and set of practices, Tantra is as alive as ever. Sects in India, including the Aghoris, reveal the enduring power of the movement. Their practices include smearing their bodies with the ash of burnt corpses from funerary pyres, as seen here, an act which is traditionally deemed polluting.\nPhotograph of two Aghoris in Madhya Pradesh, India, 1992. Photo \u00a9 Dolf Hartsuiker.\nFor the Aghoris, transgressive practices are an expression of the Tantric assertion that all is sacred and there is no distinction between what is conventionally perceived as pure and impure, just as there is no distinction between the self and the divine. By shattering society\u2019s cultural conditioning of the mind, the Aghoris transcend ego-led emotions such as fear and aversion and instead nurture a non-discriminating attitude that draws on the repressed power of the taboo.\nTantra and the female gaze\nIn the contemporary art world, female artists have harnessed Tantric goddesses through the bodies of real women,\u00a0evoking them in a feminist\u00a0guise. The title of this almost three-metre tall mixed-media painting,\u00a0Housewives with Steak-knives, challenges the stereotype of the submissive wife confined to the kitchen.

The stories of how he tricked the one-eyed Cyclops, evaded the flesh-eating Laestrygonians, and resisted the lure of the sirens as he struggled to reach Ithaca, are some of the most memorable in Homer\u2019s Odyssey. These stories may be fictional, but they form the heart of a poem that has reverberated down the centuries as a vessel of eternal truths.\nHerbert Draper (1863\u20131920), Ulysses and the Sirens, 1909. Ferens Art Gallery.\nFor centuries, people have been trying to discover who was behind the timeless tales of the Odyssey and its predecessor, the Iliad. Homer, the name attached to the two poems, remains a mysterious figure. Was he a man? Was \u2018Homer\u2019 a group or lineage of poets? Was Homer a woman? The late-19th-century novelist Samuel Butler was convinced that the author of the Odyssey, at least, was female. For most people in antiquity, however, the two epics were the products of a single male mind.\nEtching showing an allegorical scene from the title page of an edition of the Iliad and the Odyssey. Homer is standing in the centre and reciting poetry. Apollo, the god of poetry, is listening on the right. After Jan Goeree. Around 1710.\nIn the second century AD, a satirical writer named Lucian imagined meeting the poet and interrogating him as to who he truly was. \u2018Homer\u2019 revealed to him that many people believed he came from the Aegean island of Chios, or from Smyrna or Colophon, on the west coast of what is now Turkey. While his words were to be taken lightly, scholars today consider it highly probable that the Homeric poems did indeed originate in these parts. Their Greek, while not one that was ever spoken, is overall more typical of the ancient dialects of the west coast of Turkey and the islands just off the coast than it is of those of mainland Greece.\nMap of the Aegean showing some of the places where Homer was said to have come from. These include Smyrna and Colophon on the west coast of what is now Turkey, and the islands of Ios and Chios.\nHomer was associated with this part of the world from a very early date. Several writers described a talented poet of Chios, where a group of performing bards calling themselves the \u2018Homeridae\u2019 or \u2018children of Homer\u2019 had also established itself by the 6th century BC. References also exist in the early sources to Homer being conceived on the island of Ios or at Cyme and being born at Smyrna (modern-day Izmir).\nThe earliest coin to feature Homer dates to the fourth century BC and comes from Ios.\nAncient writers had various ideas about what Homer looked like. The word \u2018Homeros\u2019 could mean \u2018hostage\u2019 in Greek, so some imagined that he was a captive. But \u2018Homeros\u2019 could also mean \u2018blind\u2019, and the image of a blind bard proved particularly compelling. One reason for this was that the Odyssey features a blind but immensely talented poet named Demodocus who recites his work before a royal court.\nMarble bust of Homer, which depicts him as blind. 2nd century AD. Roman copy of a Hellenistic original of the 2nd BC.\nIt is possible that the blindness of Homer was a myth invented to account for the fact that the Homeric poems originally evolved orally, before the development of writing in Greece, by being performed and passed down from bard to bard. Like the blind poet Demodocus in the Odyssey, a bard would have sung the poems before an audience, repeating passages and set phrases, such as \u2018godlike Odysseus\u2019, to satisfy the poetic metre.\nAthenian red-figure storage jar (amphora) showing a bard reciting or singing poetry. About 500\u2013480 BC.\nThe Iliad and Odyssey are conventionally dated to the late 8th or early 7th century BC. By this time the use of writing was becoming more widespread in Greece and it seems that the poems were also set down for the first time. But it\u2019s clear that the poems contain features preserved from the pre-writing age.\nThis Etruscan painting from a tomb shows the Judgement of Paris. At the left, Paris awaits the three goddesses. Aphrodite, last of the three, lifts her dress to show a flash of leg. On the right, Helen is approached by three women bringing jewellery and perfume. About 560-550 BC.\nThe story of the origins of the Trojan War, for example, in which Paris, prince of Troy, granted Aphrodite, goddess of love, the golden apple, is alluded to only briefly by Homer. It\u2019s taken for granted that anyone coming to the poems would already have known the details. The story of the judgement of Paris, in other words, is at least contemporary, if not older, than the poems themselves.\nThe poems may also preserve memories of an earlier, heroic age. The men of this time are presented as far stronger and mightier than those who came after them.\u00a0Many scholars today believe that, if anything like the Trojan War ever happened,\u00a0 the most feasible historical background for the heroic age of the epics is the Late Bronze Age, about 400 years before the Iliad and Odyssey were first written down. Still today the monumental architecture of the city of Troy speaks of the highly developed civilisation that flourished in this period in Anatolia. It finds its counterpart in the grand palaces that Mycenaean Greeks built in the Peloponnese in the period between 1600\u20131200 BC. The precise reasons for why their civilisation collapsed in the 12th century BC are still a matter of scholarly debate.\nThe lion gate at Mycenae. Mycenae was one of the most important settlements in Greece during the Bronze Age. Photo by Andreas Trepte, www.photo-natur.net.\nThe poems contain descriptions which evoke this glorious lost age. But they also contain details which derive from later times. There is a reference to the building of temples to the gods, for example, but the earliest Greek temples to the gods that we know of were constructed in the eighth century BC. It is partly accidental that the Homeric epics are such a chronological jumble \u2013 they preserve real memories and traces and phrases of the ancient past \u2013 and partly intentional. The war is set in the ancient past, so words and objects were chosen to characterise this earlier time.\nSo where might Homer fit into this? Going on the theory that there was a Homer, perhaps a poet who was born in Smyrna and worked on Chios, was he the original storyteller who came up with the plots of the epics, influenced perhaps by a conflict just north of where he came from, at Troy?\nOr was Homer at the other end of the process? After being passed orally from generation to generation, the poems must have been refined when they were written down for the first time. So, should we think of Homer as a sort of editor, who shaped the inherited material into the complete poems?\nOr is \u2018Homer\u2019 more a spirit than anything else, simply a name to give to a pair of remarkable poems which evolved and grew over hundreds of years and which can\u2019t be attributed to anyone in particular?\nLawrence Alma-Tadema, A Reading from Homer, 1885.\u00a0Philadelphia Museum of Art.\nEveryone is entitled to their own view on this. My own is that it is not inconceivable that there was an original bard who came from the part of the world that we now know formed the setting of the poems. Perhaps he composed the epics in outline, building on stories passed down from his parents, grandparents and great-grandparents, which later poets developed and perpetuated orally. Finally these poems were written down.\nIt\u2019s for each of us to decide whether to believe in one Homer or in many, in a blind bard or in a spirit that encapsulates the most astonishing process of preservation of stories told long ago. What is important is that we have the poems at all and continue to recognise their worth. It is uplifting to think that we can find as much joy in Homer\u2019s poetry today as our forebears did 3,000 years ago.\nDaisy Dunn is the author of Homer: A Ladybird Expert Book (Penguin Random House) and Of Gods and Men: 100 Stories from Ancient Greece and Rome (Head of Zeus).\nThe BP exhibition Troy: myth and reality ran from 21 November 2019 \u2013 8 March 2020.\nBuy the book accompanying the exhibition here."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/an-introduction-to-the-arctic/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "An introduction to the Arctic", "author": "Amber Lincoln, curator, the Citi exhibition Arctic: culture and climate", "timestamp": "2020-01-09 00:00:00", "text": "The Arctic captures the imagination, calling to mind a pristine, empty, icy world that in many ways stands still: frozen and timeless. This romantic idea is appealing but of course false. You only have to read the news to know that today the Arctic isn\u2019t standing still. Reporting on scientific studies and assessments by the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), helps us all understand how quickly the Arctic is changing as a result of global climate change. Temperatures are rising, altering weather patterns, sea ice is shrinking, raising global sea levels, and permafrost, the once permanently frozen ground that served as bedrock, is melting and sinking. These changes are dramatic and unlike any experienced in the Arctic before, but the truth is, the Arctic never has stood still, nor have its Indigenous People.\nWhere is the Arctic?\nThe Arctic is the most northern place on earth and covers 4% of its surface. Its centre, the North Pole, rests over the Arctic ocean, which until recently has been covered by relatively stable, year-round sea ice. The Arctic Circle designates both the southern boundary of the Arctic and the latitude (66.5\u00b0 North) at which the sun remains above, or below, the horizon for 24 hours, at least one day per year. The further north you go, sunlight is gained or lost at greater speed.\nIn general, Arctic winters are dark. Moonlight reflecting off snow and ice generates light but life adjusts to the dim. Summers are full of light and people full of energy. However, the intense sunlight reflecting off snow or ice in spring can be very harmful and cause blindness, so Arctic Peoples have made spectacles to protect their eyes. These 19th-century Dolgan examples from north-central Siberia were made from pierced metal and beads embroidered onto reindeer hide. Today, Arctic Peoples use hats and sunglasses, but these historic models elegantly protected the eyes, focused the vision, and helped communicate identity through their different styles.\nMan\u2019s snow-spectacles, Dolgan, Yenisei (Russia). Reindeer skin, metal, glass beads, uranium beads. Pre-1879.\n\nAre there seasons in the Arctic?\nThe seasonal behavior of light helps eliminate another false idea about the Arctic \u2013 that it is always frozen and barren. Certainly, winter months are dark and cold, temperatures commonly reach -40\u00b0 C and many animals migrate south. But these lean seasons alternate with periods of extraordinary abundance in the summer, when continental temperatures in areas such as north-central Siberia or the Northwest Territories, Canada, can reach 30\u201335\u00b0C. The continuous daylight in summer generates algae blooms in sea ice habitats, forming the base of the food chain for masses of migrating sea mammals and birds. Local plants and fungi spring to life with berries, greens and mushrooms, supporting reindeer, caribou and other land animals. Arctic Peoples thrive by harnessing the great concentrations of animals and plants during abundant times to carry them through lean stretches.\nKiliii Yuyan (b. 1979), Umiaq and north wind during spring whaling. Inkjet print, 2019. \u00a9 Kiliii Yuyan.\nWho lives in the Arctic?\nToday, four million people live in the Arctic. They are spread across the eight countries with territory in the Arctic: Russia, USA, Canada, Denmark/Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Only 10% (400,000) of those Arctic inhabitants are indigenous to the region, belonging to one or more of the 40 different cultural groups. The S\u00e1mi are the only Indigenous Arctic Peoples in northern Europe, occupying parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland and north-west Russia. There are many different groups in north-west Russia and northern Siberia. The Nenets, Mansi and Khanty, and Nganasan originate in north-west Russia. The Evenki, Even, Sakha, and Dolgan are from north-central Siberia. The Yukaghir, Koryak, Chukchi, and Siberian Yupik occupy the Russian Far East. Indigenous People in North America include the Aleuts, Alutiit, Yupiit, and Inupiat of Alaska, the Gwich\u2019in bordering Alaska and Canada, and Inuit groups of Canada and Greenland.\nKiliii Yuyan (b. 1979), Whaling Crew on Watch at Amuaq. Archival inkjet print, 2018. \u00a9 Kiliii Yuyan.\nThese Indigenous Arctic Peoples have traded and engaged with each other for millennia. Today they collaborate in international organisations such as the Arctic Council and the Inuit Circumpolar Council. The Inuit are a unified indigenous group, sharing a common language, culture and history, who live within four countries: Chukotka, Chukotka (Russia), Alaska (USA), Canada, Greenland (Denmark). In Canada and Greenland, the term \u2018Eskimo\u2019 is considered derogatory because it was a name given by non-Inuit people and thought to mean \u2018eater of raw meat\u2019. Linguists now believe \u2018Eskimo\u2019 was a term used by the Ojibwe (Indigenous People from Canada and North America) for Inuit meaning \u2018to net snowshoes\u2019. Nonetheless, Inuit is the name they use to describe themselves. Eskimo is more commonly used in Alaska to collectively refer to all Inuit and Yupiit. This is because \u2018Inuit\u2019 is not a word in the Yupiit languages of Siberia and Alaska.\nHow long have people lived in the Arctic?\nThe Arctic has been occupied for a very long time and the cultures are remarkably old. When much of Europe was covered in glaciers, the steppe (or plains) of northeastern Siberia was glacier free and it was possible to settle. Recent archaeological findings show that Paleolithic hunters occupied the mouth of the Yana River of north eastern Siberia 30,000 years ago. Inhabitants hunted woolly mammoth and other megafauna (large animals such as woolly rhinoceros, giant horse and some species of bison that are now extinct) and they developed the first Arctic art. The ancient people of Yana (in north eastern Siberia) spent a lot of time making jewellery, adorning themselves with animal-teeth pendants and beads made from mammoth tusks, hare bones or rare minerals. They also made bracelets engraved with detailed marks indicating personal or community identity. The earliest Arctic inhabitants led rich lives, created a cultural aesthetic and used resources available to them in innovative ways.\nWalrus ivory bracelet, Yana-site, Russia, c. 28,000\u201326,000 BC.

This Inuit hunting outfit made from caribou fur from Baffin Island, Nunavut, was made in 1987. It kept the wearer warm while traveling by sled or snowmobile in the winter. But clothing serves multiple functions.\nMan\u2019s winter parka. Inuit, Iglulik (Nunavut).

This S\u00e1mi women\u2019s hat, called L\u00e1djogahpir, or \u2018foremother\u2019s horn hats\u2019, was made with a piece of wood called fierra. It identified the wearer as a S\u00e1mi woman of Norway. These hats fell out of use around 1870 after missionaries, who interpreted the horn as representing the devil, considered them sinful. Today, hats in the style of the L\u00e1djogahpir have taken on a new identity. Amid wider S\u00e1mi revitalisation movements, S\u00e1mi women have started making and wearing the l\u00e1djogahpir again as colonial resistance art.\nWoman\u2019s hat or l\u00e1djogahpir, S\u00e1mi, Norway.

Archival inkjet print, 2017. \u00a9 Kiliii Yuyan.\nToday Arctic Peoples are fully participating global citizens, engaging in all sorts of markets and industries. Many Arctic Peoples live in southern or Arctic cities, working various jobs including in the oil and gas industries, tourism and commercial fishing. Others pursue education. Some Arctic Peoples live in smaller settlements, within or near their ancestral homelands, engaging in more traditional economies. Because the Arctic does not support agriculture, in the past, Arctic Peoples have relied upon animals. Diets and livelihoods were dependent on hunting, fishing, trapping and reindeer herding. Many Arctic Peoples today continue to pursue these ways of life, maintaining close links with their homelands and traditional cuisine. Some reindeer herders, such as the Nenets of north central Russia, travel seasonally with their migrating herds of reindeer. Similarly, hunters or fishers might make journeys from their villages to hunting grounds, by crossing land or sea ice.\nHarpoon-head. Yupiit; Kuskokwim. Ivory, brass, and seal or walrus skin, pre-1900.\nOne piece of adaptive technology used to hunt seals, as well as whales and walrus, is still used today. As year-round inhabitants of the Arctic, seals provide crucial nutrients and materials for Inuit. \u00a0The toggle-head harpoon is an ingenious hunting tool because it prevents hunters from losing their prey to the sea. They were often beautifully engraved, like this late 19thh-century Yupiit model, in order to attract animals and show them respect. Harpoon heads were fitted into shafts and thrown by hunters. The toggle-head swivelled upon entering the animal\u2019s skin so it couldn\u2019t easily exit the wound hole. Attached to a line, hunters could easily retrieve harpooned animals and avoid wounding and losing one.\nTundra in Ilulisaat, Greenland.\nKiliii Yuyan (b. 1979), Ilulisaat\u2019s Living Ice Fjord. Archival inkjet print, 2018. \u00a9 Kiliii Yuyan.\nIn addition to hunting and fishing, Arctic Peoples in Asia and Europe herded reindeer. Herders tailored their pastoral practice to the ecosystems of the Arctic. The tundra is generally located near the coast at very high latitudes. No trees grow in the tundra but lichen, which reindeer eat, grows in huge quantities. The unobstructed views and open landscapes enable herders to keep very large herds. Migrating with hundreds or even thousands of reindeer, the Nenets, Chukchi and some S\u00e1mi groups travel hundreds of kilometres across the tundra each year to winter and summer rangeland (open country for grazing or hunting animals).\nReindeer harness, Evenki, Yenisei (Russia). Reindeer skin, cotton, glass beads, ivory, wood and metal, 1840s\u20131870s.\nTaiga (referred to as the Boreal forest in North America) has small, but in some places, thick tree growth. Trees of the taiga offer herders less visibility and more obstructions, therefore herders keep fewer animals and focus on riding and packing their reindeer. Rather than using sleds, which can get entangled in the branches of the forest, the Evenki use bags of reindeer hide to store their equipment and food while traveling or hunting. Both Evenki men and women ride special reindeer that are trained to manoeuvre through the taiga. This women\u2019s reindeer saddle, made from white reindeer fur and wood, provides both the rider and reindeer comfort. Reflecting their value to herders, reindeer often are often made beautifully decorated harnesses, pack saddles and other tack, such as this Dolgan beaded harness.\nTaiga or Boreal forest.\nKiliii Yuyan (b. 1979), Boreal Forest Dash.

Arctic communities are vulnerable to erratic storms and freeze/thaws conditions, eroding coastlines, melting permafrost and rising sea levels. In response, Indigenous Arctic organisations are advocating globally about these challenges. Collaborating with researchers, and national and international agencies, Indigenous Arctic organisations are pushing for innovative solutions to develop plans for action to sea level rise and sea ice loss. Through organisations like the Inuit Circumpolar Council, the Arctic Council, and the S\u00e1mi Council, elders, leaders and young people advocate for measures to search for answers to the most challenging problem of the 21st century, serving as exemplars of how to remain unified in a rapidly changing world.\nDiscover more about life in the Arctic in the Citi exhibition Arctic: culture and climate.\nLead supporter Citi\nSupported by\nJulie and Stephen Fitzgerald\nAKO Foundation\nBuy the beautifully illustrated book accompanying the exhibition here.\nIncluded in The Times\u2019 Best Art Books of the Year 2020."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/bonnie-greer-the-era-of-reclamation/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Bonnie Greer: the Era of Reclamation", "author": "Bonnie Greer", "timestamp": "2020-01-08 00:00:00", "text": "\u2018Truth is a big table and everybody\u2019s got to sit at it.\u2019\nThis is the quote that a critic selected in a review of my new podcast, an Audible Original series, In Search of Black History.\nThat\u2019s me.

Not into a storehouse of imperial loot. And how could I?\nThis year I am curating \u2018The Era of Reclamation.\u2019, a series of conversations, which the Director of the Museum, Hartwig Fischer, has taken an active and supporting part in helping to frame. These conversations are all about reclaiming.\nReclaiming is at the heart of many of the great questions and movements of our part of the 21st century. From the return of African objects to their places of origin, all the way to the renaming of our very selves.\nKara Walker (b. 1969), no world from An Unpeopled Land in Uncharted Waters. Aquatint, 2010. \u00a9 Kara Walker. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nMy own reclamation in this \u2018Era of Reclamation\u2019 is of what I call \u2018The Boat\u201d. \u2018The Boat\u2019 is the slave ship, the vehicle of deportation and exile, into what could have only been seen by the victims of the slave trade as the void. But for me, \u2018The Boat\u2019 is also the vehicle on which a kind of big bang occurred. A change. And a new people were born.\nThis birth was not simply a matter of the defeat and subjugation of the African nations that made up what was called the \u2018slave coast\u2019. This new people, my people, were also fashioned out of a true \u2018clash of civilisations\u2019 between Europe and Africa.\n\u2018The Boat\u2019 is an expanding story, still unfolding.\n\nInside Room 41, showcasing the Museum\u2019s Anglo-Saxon collections.\nRecently a friend suggested that I pour a libation inside the British Museum. I asked him, \u2018a libation of cleansing, or one of thanksgiving?\u2019 Thanksgiving, for example, for the fact that I discovered I love the Anglo-Saxons at the Museum. No, not the white supremacists and other evil people who have appropriated their name. The real ones. The ones way-back-when with their beautiful and intricate objects. Their love of learning. Their lives and their colourful world, almost erased by the destruction of the monasteries and churches in the 16th century, by Henry VIII.\nI\u2019m interested in their story and everything about them: the objects associated with them. The fact that a queen known as the Lady of Mercia handed her queenship on to her daughter, the only time this has happened in English history.

Not for them the super-slim Egyptians. The people of Kush loved big ladies and revelled in their bigness. Their queens were so fierce that the rocks that the Romans made as weapons sometimes had a curse on them directed at the queen. Between the Kushite and Roman empires it was personal. One of the queens took the head off a statue of the Roman emperor Augustus and buried it in the ground so that people would actually walk on the head of the emperor. That object is called the Mero\u00eb Head. You can see it at the Museum in Room 70. And it\u2019s free.\nThe conversations that make up \u2018The Era of Reclamation\u2019 ask questions like: is there a diminution of the African Caribbean voice in the British public sphere? Does the LGBTQ community point a way out of the \u2018Wakanda-isation\u2019* of African history and towards a \u2018meta Africa\u2019 \u2013 a new space that exists not only in Africa, but in Europe, the Americas, the world.

Becket was one of the most powerful figures of his time, serving as royal Chancellor and later as Archbishop of Canterbury. Initially a close friend of King Henry II, the two men became engaged in a bitter dispute that culminated in Becket\u2019s shocking murder by knights with close ties to the king. It is a story of betrayal, of the perceived abuse of power and those who fall for standing in the way of the Crown. Here we explore Becket\u2019s rise and fall, and unpick the events that led to the murder that shook the Middle Ages\u2026\nWho was Thomas Becket?\nBecket was a second-generation French immigrant, born around 1120 in Cheapside, in the City of London, to Gilbert and Matilda, who had left Normandy following the Norman Conquest. His father was a well-connected merchant but the family were neither excessively wealthy nor powerful. Becket was sent to school at Merton Priory and, after a few years studying in Paris, he eventually gained employment through one of his father\u2019s friends as a clerk for Theobald, the then Archbishop of Canterbury. Becket was described by his contemporaries as intelligent, charming and authoritative and, in 1155, he got his biggest break. Recognising his talents, Theobald suggested that Henry II appoint Becket as Chancellor of England. He and the king quickly became close friends, hunting, gaming and travelling around England together. Becket embraced life in the royal court: he is said by his contemporary biographers to have enjoyed vast wealth, throwing lavish parties, decorating his residences with beautiful furnishings and making numerous journeys to France on his own ships.\nPendant with an image of Thomas Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury, 15th century, England.\nRise and fall\nWhen the position of Archbishop of Canterbury became vacant, Becket was put forward. Given his lifestyle and reputation he was an unlikely candidate but the king had other ideas. Henry was keen to appoint his close friend to the role but, crucially, he wanted him to continue as Chancellor. With Becket in both positions, Henry saw an opportunity to exercise greater authority over the Church as well as the state. Becket was appointed Archbishop on 23 May 1162 and consecrated (officially blessed) on 3 June. However, at some point during the rest of that year, and against the king\u2019s wishes, Becket resigned as Chancellor. His actions drove a wedge between him and the king which would never be repaired. From this point on, Becket\u2019s relationship with Henry began to deteriorate. A series of disputes ensued regarding the division of power between the Crown and the Church. By 1164, tensions were at an all-time high and, in October, Becket was summoned to appear before the King\u2019s council and ordered to forfeit all his personal property. He refused to accept the terms of his punishment and, fearing further repercussions from the king, he fled to France.\nLife in exile\nBecket remained in exile in France for six years. During this time Henry flexed his power in England. His most blatant snub of his old friend\u2019s authority was his decision to have his son, Henry the Young King, crowned in June 1170 by Becket\u2019s long-standing enemy, the Archbishop of York. Becket appealed to the Pope and, under significant pressure, Henry agreed to reopen negotiations. Following this, the Archbishop and the king spoke privately for the first time since 1164, and Henry promised to restore Becket\u2019s rights as Archbishop of Canterbury.\u00a0Becket was reassured that it would be safe to return to England. However, his final act was to punish those involved in the unauthorised coronation. Before leaving France Becket issued three letters expelling (excommunicating) the Archbishop of York and two bishops from the Church. This act was to have devastating consequences upon his return to England.\nPilgrim badge, 14th century, England, showing Becket returning from exile in France.\nThe lead up to the murder\nBecket returned from exile on 1 December 1170. Contemporary reports record that he was greeted on his journey back to the Cathedral by cheering crowds and rejoicing monks, but he faced increasing hostility by the authorities loyal to the king. Meanwhile, the Archbishop of York and the Bishops of London and Salisbury, furious that they had been excommunicated, travelled to Henry\u2019s royal court in Normandy where they relayed Becket\u2019s actions to the king. Henry was outraged and, although it is unclear whether he ever specifically ordered retribution for Becket\u2019s actions, his furious outburst prompted four knights \u2013 Reginald FitzUrse, William de Tracy, Hugh de Morville and Richard le Bret \u2013 to travel to Canterbury in search of Becket. One of Becket\u2019s biographers records Henry\u2019s words as:\nWhat miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk!\nFrank Barlow, Thomas Becket (California: University of California Press, 1986), p. 235.\nThe crime scene\nWe are fortunate to have five eye-witness accounts of Becket\u2019s murder, all of which broadly agree on the details of what took place. One key account was written by a man named Edward Grim, who was so close to Becket during the skirmish that he was wounded by one of the knight\u2019s swords. Grim tells us that when the four knights arrived at Canterbury Cathedral, Becket was in the Archbishop\u2019s Palace.\u00a0They attempted to arrest him but he refused. Becket was persuaded by the monks to take refuge in the church, but the knights pursued him, bursting into the Cathedral with swords drawn, terrifying those inside by shouting:\n\u201cWhere is Thomas Becket, traitor to the king and the kingdom?\u201d the knights then rushed at him\u2026 roughly manhandling and dragging him, intending to kill him outside the church, or carry him away in chains.\nThe Lives of Thomas Becket, ed. and trans. by Michael Staunton (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001), p. 201.\n\nAlabaster sculpture, c. 1450\u20131550, England.\nHere, Becket is shown kneeling at an altar, his eyes closed and his hands clasped in prayer, all the while four knights draw their swords behind him. To Becket\u2019s right is the monk Edward Grim, whose arm was injured by one of the knight\u2019s swords.\nAs Grim recounts, Becket held tight onto one of the Cathedral\u2019s pillars to prevent them seizing him, and it was at this point that one of the knights raised his sword for the first time, bringing it down on Becket, slicing off the crown of his head. Two of the other knights then started to attack Becket and most of the monks fled. The third blow brought the Archbishop\u2019s life to an end. Gruesomely, by the end of the attack, Becket\u2019s crown had:\n\u201cseparated from the head so that the blood [turned] white from the brain, and the brain equally red from the blood.\u201d\nThe Lives of Thomas Becket, ed. and trans. by Michael Staunton (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001), p. 203.\nThe murderous knights were accompanied by a clerk, who, because of his involvement, became known as \u2018Mauclerk\u2019 or \u2018evil clerk\u2019. Following the attack, this Mauclerk:\nput his foot on the neck of the holy priest and precious martyr, and, horrible to say, scattered the brains with the blood over the pavement. \u201cLet us go, knights\u201d, he called out to the others, \u201cthis fellow will not get up again.\nThe Lives of Thomas Becket, ed. and trans. by Michael Staunton (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001), p. 203.\nThe aftermath\nChaos ensued following the murder, and with none of those present knowing what to do next, the body remained where it had fallen for several hours. Some individuals dipped parts of their clothes in his spilled blood, or collected it in small vessels to take away in anticipation of Becket\u2019s future sanctity. After spending the night on the high altar of the Cathedral, he was buried by the monks the next day in the crypt. Reports immediately circulated of miraculous healings connected to Becket. Facing increasing pressure from the people of Canterbury, the monks opened the crypt of the Cathedral so pilgrims could visit his tomb. An extraordinary wave of miracles was recorded and, in recognition of this, Becket was made a saint (canonised) by the Pope on 21 February 1173. It was one of the fastest canonisations in history. Becket\u2019s reputation as a miracle-working saint spread quickly and people from all over Europe started to flock to Canterbury in the hope that they would be healed. As well as visiting the tomb, pilgrims could also purchase a mixture of his blood and water, called St Thomas\u2019 Water, which was bottled and sold by opportunistic monks in small lead vessels called ampulla. Henry II, in a public act of penance for his involvement in the murder, visited the tomb in 1174, granting royal approval to Becket\u2019s cult.\nLead ampulla, c. 1170\u20131200, England.\nThis small vessel, which is decorated with an open-work image of Becket flanked by two of his sword-bearing murderers, would have been filled with some of the saints\u2019 miracle-working, watered-down blood. It is inscribed: \u201cThomas is the best doctor for the worthy sick\u201d.\nBecket\u2019s death and subsequent miracles transformed Canterbury Cathedral into one of the most important pilgrimage destinations in Europe. In 1220 his body was moved from the crypt to a glittering new shrine in a purpose-built chapel upstairs in the Cathedral. Geoffrey Chaucer famously captured something of the atmosphere of pilgrimage to this shrine in his Canterbury Tales. In death Becket remained a figure of opposition to unbridled power and became seen as the quintessential defender of the rights of the Church. To this end you can find images of his murder in churches across Latin Christendom, from Germany and Spain, to Italy and Norway. Becket was, and remains, a truly European saint. His relics at Canterbury were visited by people from across the continent until 1538, when Henry VIII would label him a traitor, order the destruction of his shrine and try to wipe him from history altogether. That, however, is a story for another time.\nThomas Becket will open at the British Museum 22 April \u2013\u00a022 August 2021.

But this artistic movement spread far beyond the confines of the canvas to influence ceramics, glassmaking, architecture and literature, to name but a few disciplines.\nAn interest in design and technique defined the production of revivalist art. Craftsmen studied Islamic art in museum collections and publications, and strove to create imitations or variations of the originals. European and North American craftsmen saw these intricate designs and sophisticated techniques as superior to those in the industrialised West, where objects were becoming more and more mass produced.\nDue to an increase in travel, trade, diplomatic encounters and colonial expansion, objects and works of art exchanged hands more readily. Exhibitions and world fairs, such as London\u2019s 1851 Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations, and subsequent fairs in London, Paris and Vienna, among others, also offered the public the chance to see objects and materials from around the world.\nThe influence of ceramics from Islamic lands\nIznik glazed ceramic dish, Turkey, c. 1530\u20131540.\nTh\u00e9odore Deck (1823\u20131891), glazed ceramic dish. France, c. 1865. @ Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia.\n19th-century Islamic revivalist art is particularly apparent in glass and ceramics, especially dishes and tiles. Beautiful examples of these imitations are featured in Inspired by the east, some alongside their originals. One common source of inspiration for craftsmen was Iznik ceramics from Turkey. Named after the town of Iznik, southeast of Istanbul, these ceramics were produced from the late 15th century to the end of the 17th century. Iznik ceramics were originally inspired by Chinese blue-and-white porcelains, but gradually developed into their own style through the addition of further colours and local designs. They were a clear source of inspiration to the French 19th-century ceramicist Th\u00e9odore Deck, for his near-identical version of a 16th-century Iznik dish is on display in the exhibition next to the original.\nSlipped, painted and glazed ceramic tile, Netherlands, c. 1880.\nPainted and glazed Damascus ceramic tile, Syria, c. 1600\u20131800.\nTiles were another significant source of inspiration to European and North American craftsmen. Many buildings such as mosques, shrines and palaces across the Middle East and North Africa are exquisitely decorated with colourful tiles bearing geometric, floral and sometimes figural designs. As with the dishes above, some tiles were copied almost exactly by Western artists, while others were adapted to fit within a particular European or North American design vocabulary. Within the Ottoman Empire, the town of Iznik produced great quantities of tiles, but other towns and cities such as Damascus were also important production sites. Similarities can be seen in the example shown here of a Damascus tile alongside a late 19th-century Dutch variation.\nArtist unknown. Impression taken from RMS Titanic\u2019s brochure, depicting the cooling room of the Turkish baths, c. 1908. Courtesy of Henry Aldridge and Son.\nIn Europe and North America, wall tiles became more regularly used from the 1850s onwards. Developments in sanitation and healthcare meant they were valued as easily cleaned surfaces, and advancements in industry allowed for mass-production. As such, wealthy patrons with an interest in the \u2018Orient\u2019 could commission rooms filled with tiles, either copying or referencing designs and colours from the Middle East and North Africa.\nThe Islamic interior\nThe Arab Hall in Leighton House, Holland Park, London, is an excellent example of a room decorated and filled with tiles to evoke the \u2018Orient\u2019. 19th-century artist Frederic, Lord Leighton was a keen traveller and collector of objects from the Middle East and North Africa and, as a result, commissioned an \u2018Arab Hall\u2019 for his home in 1877. He employed architect George Aitchison to create this room based on a hall from a 12th-century castle in Sicily. Alongside Aitchison, designer Walter Crane worked on one of the friezes in the room and ceramicist William De Morgan produced some of the tiles. The result is a vibrant, splendid mixture of Islamic tiles and architectural references alongside European tiles and design elements.\nRecent photograph of the Arab Hall, Leighton House Museum. \u00a9Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.\nWhile the tiles in Leighton House come from different parts of the Islamic world, the majority were brought back from Damascus by Leighton himself or his friends and contacts. Where there were gaps in the tile panels, Leighton employed De Morgan to create replicas of the 16\u201317th century originals. Additionally, De Morgan produced undecorated tiles of a striking turquoise colour to cover the walls in the entrance of the house, and further embellish the space.\nThe influence of glass from the Islamic world\nGilded and enamelled glass mosque lamp, Cairo, c.1330.\nEnamelling and gilding glass was a highly established art form in Egypt and Syria during the 13th and 14th centuries. Vessels of various forms were produced, but particularly spectacular and intricate were the lamps that hung from the ceilings of mosques and shrines. Designed to hold water, oil and a floating wick, these illuminated lamps were often embellished with enamelled calligraphy bearing verses from the Qur\u2018an or dedicatory inscriptions. These mosque lamps were technically difficult to make as the glass first had to be free-blown to create the desired shape, and then decorated with the coloured enamels and gilt.\nPhilippe-Joseph Brocard (1831\u20131896), gilded and enamelled glass mosque lamp. France, c.1877. @ Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia.\nEnamelled and gilded glass objects were not only made for local patrons but also for export to Europe. These works greatly influenced glass production in the West due to the high level of craftsmanship they demonstrated. Examples ended up in the homes of private collectors, museums, and were also displayed in world fairs. French glassmaker Philippe-Joseph Brocard studied the designs on \u2013 and techniques evident in \u2013 mosque lamps from Egypt and Syria in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny in Paris. He then began to collect examples and taught himself the technique. He was one of the first Westerners to revive the technique of Islamic enamelling and his works include near-identical copies and variations of the originals.\nNew colour schemes and materials\nTh\u00e9odore Deck (1823\u20131891), glazed ceramic basin. France, c. 1860-80. @ Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia.\nInlaid brass basin, Egypt or Syria, c. 1320\u20131341.\n\n\n\nTh\u00e9odore Deck (1823\u20131891), glazed ceramic bowl. France, c. 1860\u201380. @ Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia.\n\nWhile many European and North American craftsmen working in the revivalist style reproduced Islamic objects in keeping with their original materials and techniques, some chose different mediums. French artist Th\u00e9odore Deck did both, as evidenced by his Iznik-inspired dish, and this ceramic basin and bowl which reference Islamic metalware. Both ceramic pieces follow the form of the 14th-century inlaid metalwork (the basin was made in Egypt or Syria), yet Deck has taken artistic liberties in his use of coloured glazes. The turquoise-blue used on the bowl \u2013 known as \u2018bleu Deck\u2019 \u2013 was developed by Deck and can be found on many of his ceramic pieces. Between 1861 and 1873 his work was shown at a number of the international exhibitions, including Paris, London and Vienna.\nTowards the end of the 19th century, craftsmen began to stray from their original sources. While the designs, techniques and colours, informed by the arts of the Islamic world, remained a clear source of inspiration, they became diluted as craftsmen began to feed them into the vocabulary of the Arts and Crafts movement emerging in Europe and North America.\nSee these beautiful examples of 19th century revivalist artworks alongside impressive original works in Inspired by the east: how the Islamic world influenced western art open until 26 January 2020.

Rubbish and us explores our changing relationship with rubbish. Wandering the galleries of the British Museum, you can see some of the finest objects ever created by human hands. But you might be surprised to learn that some of our most precious objects are things that were once thrown away. Today, they have become invaluable tools for learning about the past.\nOn display in Room 3, Disposable? takes a group of objects from the Museum\u2019s diverse archaeological collection: finds from Staple Howe in North Yorkshire, a small settlement inhabited sometime between around 700 BC and 450 BC. These pot fragments, animal bones, and tools were cast aside when they were no longer useful, accumulating in dumps of refuse around the site and being used as packing around the perimeter fence. \u00a0Thousands of years later they were uncovered and carefully recorded by archaeologists, allowing us to study and better understand the people who made, used, and eventually discarded them.\nArtist\u2019s representation of how the settlement at Staple Howe may have looked. Illustration: Craig Williams.\nFrom Staple Howe\u2019s rubbish we know that its inhabitants farmed sheep, cattle and pigs, and grew wheat. Most of their materials came from nearby: local clay was used to make pots, animal bones and shed deer antlers were used as raw materials for fishing equipment. People living in the settlement were very resourceful: a broken pot was recycled to make a spindle whorl (used for spinning wool to make thread for clothing), and a razor has been heavily sharpened to extend its long life. They also cared about their possessions and their own appearance, gathering jet from the beach to make beautiful jewellery and decorating their pottery with delicate lines of finger impressions. New research by Meredith Laing at the University of Leicester has used the size of these marks to show that the pots were made by women and children.\n\nPottery jar rim, Staple Howe, 700\u2013450 BC.\nThe skilled craftspeople of Staple Howe left no written accounts of their lives behind. We cannot speak to them, but we can place our fingers into the hollows where they once pressed theirs. The pots they made have stood the test of time. Two and a half thousand years later, they allow us to ask new questions about life in ancient Britain.\nToday, our relationship with rubbish is very different. The second half of the Disposable? display looks at the human impact of modern waste in the Pacific Island nations, which are suffering some of the worst effects. Across the world, we are seeing the creation of single-use products, particularly ones made from plastic, reach unprecedented levels. Fuelled by our demand for convenience and cheap goods these items can take hundreds of years to biodegrade and are often disposed of poorly. This has led to almost eight million metric tons of plastic entering our oceans every single year. Over fifty percent of this ocean plastic is waste from the international commercial fishing industry and is made of up of discarded nets, lines and broken equipment.\u00a0 In the Pacific these plastics join with the discarded waste entering the ocean from surrounding large nations, creating \u2018garbage patches\u2019 swirled together in ocean currents called Pacific Gyres.\nPolluted seashore in Honiara, Solomon Islands. Image: Roy Hills.\nA simple yet technically beautiful yellow fishing basket made by Guam artist and net-maker Anthony C Guerrero highlights the extent of the plastic waste problem in the Pacific. For centuries, fishing baskets in Guam were woven from coconut leaves but here Guerrero used discarded plastic wrapping found on his local beach. These straps are waste from the construction industry, which mostly services foreign tourists. While the basket is made using traditional weaving techniques, the plastic wrapping is more durable than plant fibres. Guerrero has found a creative and practical way to give this robust single-use material a second life.\n\nAnthony C Guerrero, fishing basket made of recycled plastic construction strapping, Guam, 2016.\nIn 2016 Guerrero exhibited the basket at the Festival of the Pacific\u00a0Arts in Guam where it was bought by a British Museum curator and entered the Museum\u2019s collection. A beautiful work of art, the basket demonstrates the resilience and resourcefulness of the local Chamorro culture in Guam. It can also be seen as a powerful political statement created in response to the impact plastic waste is having on people living in the Pacific. Communities across the Pacific, like Guerrero, are working together to activate grass-roots initiatives to try and stem the impact of the problem through beach clean-ups, \u00a0re-purposing discarded items and banning some disposable plastic items. However, these local responses can by no means alleviate the scale of the problem. Much of this waste is not created locally and Pacific Island nations often have little infrastructural support for large scale recycling of waste. The plastic crisis cannot be left to individuals or small-scale interventions and will take a concerted international effort by governments across the globe to take legislative action to effect change.\nA fisherman in Guam using a recycled plastic basket, much like the one on display in Room 3.

Troy (2004).\nAllstar Picture Library/Alamy Stock Photo. \u00a9 Warner Brothers .\nFirst, I should explain how all this happened, and what I was doing there \u2013 apart, that is, from having a great time. It began with a phone call on an otherwise quiet day in the Greek and Roman department at the British Museum, where I was curator of the Greek Bronze Age collection. The Bronze Age, particularly the period around the 13th century BC, provides a feasible background for the story of the Trojan War. At this time, Mycenae was indeed powerful and influential, while Troy was a rich and strongly-fortified citadel. We have no evidence that the war really happened in the way that is described in Homer, but the archaeology of these two sites provides a possible backdrop for any such event. However, as you will know if you have seen our BP exhibition Troy: myth and reality, this is a complicated matter. The Greeks believed the war had happened at some early stage in their past, but this was not a period when history was recorded. Rather, Homer and the other bards who told the tale in around the eighth and seventh centuries BC inherited it in an oral tradition. This was poetry that was designed to be recited and listened to, not written down and read. So the story could evolve and change with each retelling, like a rolling stone gathering some things and losing others over time. The tradition was not fixed until around the sixth century BC and, even then, the tale was a springboard for invention in the hands of both writers and artists.\nMarble bust of Homer. 2nd century AD. Roman copy of a Hellenistic original of the 2nd BC.\nI had all this in the back of my mind when I picked up the phone and began to answer a question from one of the film-makers \u2013 actually about Bronze Age maps. One thing led to another, and over the course of the next few weeks I did my best with various questions. What pose should Priam adopt when worshipping the gods? What ancient Greek words should dying warriors mutter to create grim atmosphere in the aftermath of battle? Did the heroes smoke after a banquet, and if so, what? This last one took me by surprise \u2013 I could only surmise that they might have breathed in fumes of incense or perfumed oils, but they certainly wouldn\u2019t have produced pipes or cigars. I tried to answer all the questions, but always found myself up against the question of \u2018authenticity.\u2019 The film-makers were serious about authenticity, but I had to keep saying that it was complicated, and it depended on what they wanted to be authentic to. To the Bronze Age? To the supposed time of Homer? To the world of Classical Greece, when art was full of Trojan War scenes , but envisaged in a 5th-century way?\nReconstruction of Troy in the Late Bronze Age.\n\u00a9 Christoph Hau\u00dfner, M\u00fcnchen.\nIn general, they were trying to be as Bronze Age as possible, but already by the time of my involvement all sorts of compromises had been made. The film was well into production, and in fact my answers didn\u2019t have any noticeable impact on its finished state. As you will know if you have seen it, the film draws visual inspiration from many different archaeological sources. Some are Bronze Age \u2013 Mycenae has its Lion Gate, though brought indoors for the purpose, while Troy looks much like the Minoan palace of Knossos with its red, downward-tapering columns. Other elements are later \u2013 the statues in Priam\u2019s palace and Helen\u2019s flowing robes are two examples \u2013 while Middle Eastern cultures have an influence on some weaponry and props.\nPeter O\u2019Toole as Priam amongst statues of the gods.\nTroy (2004) United Archives GmbH/Alamy Stock Photo. \u00a9 Warner Brothers.\nI told them all I knew about Bronze Age postures for worshipping \u2013 which was quite a lot, because figurines show worshippers with one hand to their forehead or both forearms held upwards against the chest \u2013 but in the end Priam (Peter O\u2019Toole) knelt before his post-Bronze-Age statues of the gods. This was not surprising \u2013 the small-scale representations of the gods that we know from Bronze Age archaeology would have looked odd to modern audiences, and we are very used to people kneeling to pray. The ancient bards changed the stories to make sense to each new generation of listeners, so the film-makers had good precedents for doing the same. Nonetheless, they took some liberties that outraged scholars. The placing of coins on the eyes of the dead was hopelessly anachronistic, if this was meant to be a time before coinage was invented. But again, dramatic imperatives won out over archaeological evidence. And you can\u2019t help but feel that this was right \u2013 the aim was not to make an archaeological documentary, but a good film.\nThe Trojan horse. Troy (2004). Sportsphoto/Alamy Stock Photo. \u00a9 Warner Brothers.\nYet even if we forgive, and even enjoy, the rich but not really coherent visual picture, what do we make of how faithfully the film followed the myth? It\u2019s time for a spoiler alert, because the fates of certain characters were completely different. Again this caused spluttering outrage from those who know their Greek myths, and one can see why. How can Menelaus die at Troy, when we \u2018know\u2019 he and Helen went back to Sparta together after the Trojan War? At least, that\u2019s what most ancient versions of the story say. Similarly, how could Paris and Helen escape together into an entirely Hollywood happy ending, when she went back home and he was killed? Perhaps above all, what happens to the rest of the story of Agamemnon, if he dies? We all know he should go back to Mycenae and be killed in his bath by his wife Clytemnestra . And even if we don\u2019t all know it, the great 5th-century Athenian tragedian Aeschylus did. In his Oresteia trilogy, he tells this continuation of the tale in three of the most brilliant Greek tragedies to have survived. Yet it couldn\u2019t have happened in the world of the film, where Agamemnon doesn\u2019t make it home.\nJohn Collier (1850\u20131934), Clytemnestra, 1882. \u00a9 Guildhall Art Gallery.\nWell, the credits read \u2018inspired by Homer\u2019s Iliad\u2019 but make no claim to stick to it or any ancient version of the myth particularly closely. Indeed, scriptwriter David Benioff (later of Game of Thrones fame) said, \u2018I\u2019m not worried about desecrating a classic. Homer will survive Hollywood,\u2019 and this is undoubtedly true. Director Wolfgang Petersen both knew and respected the classical texts and was perfectly well aware of how his version differed from them. But his artistic aim, and his job, was to make an epic version of the tale that would involve and engross the widest possible audiences. So we should probably take off our Classics heads, and just judge whether it is a good film. Audiences world-wide certainly thought so, and box-office success is of course the ultimate benchmark for an expensive Hollywood production.\nOne major scene in the film does, though, both closely follow the account in the Iliad and remain immensely moving on the big screen. This is when old King Priam bravely goes in to the Greek camp at night to beg Achilles for the body of his son Hector. Achilles, in his fury, has become nothing more than a killing-machine at this stage in the story. His anger and grief over the death of Patroclus have drained all humanity from him. He has not only killed Hector, but daily misuses his corpse, dragging it bloodily behind his chariot. Priam approaches him and kneels to kiss his hand. His words in the film are:\nI have endured what no man on earth has endured. I have kissed the hands of the man who killed my son.\nRoman silver cup showing Trojan King Priam, kissing the hand of Achilles. Image: Roberto Fortuna and Kira Ursem \u00a9 National Museet Denmark.\nThis is essentially word for word what he says in the Iliad (Book 24, lines 504-6) and the whole scene is a pivotal point in the poem. The Iliad is the story of Achilles and his rage \u2013 and here, towards the end of the poem, is the resolution of his anger and his redemption as a human being. He weeps with Priam, seeing in him a reflection of his own father, whom he knows will also soon be bereaved. He has chosen his fate \u2013 a short but glorious life and eternal fame \u2013 but now sees the human cost. He has regained empathy and gives Hector\u2019s body back, allowing Priam to take it safely from the Greek camp to Troy. The funeral of Hector closes the poem. The film has more to tell, including the story of the Wooden Horse and the eventual fall of Troy. It too ends with funeral rites, but this time of Achilles himself. Leave aside any irritation with the coins on eyes, and enjoy the final monologue by Odysseus (Sean Bean), which always sends a shiver down my spine. Sadly I didn\u2019t meet him, but I think his closing words are one of the best bits of the film:\nIf they ever tell my story, let them say that I walked with giants. Men rise and fall like the winter wheat, but these names will never die. Let them say I lived in the time of Hector, tamer of horses. Let them say I lived in the time of Achilles.\nBrad Pitt as Achilles in Troy. Allstar Picture Library/Alamy Stock Photo. \u00a9 Warner Brothers.\nAnd finally \u2013 did I meet Brad Pitt? I wasn\u2019t scheduled to see any of his scenes, and heard that he was away practising sword-fighting in the mountains. But on the one day off from filming during my week in Malta, we all went out for dinner in a restaurant in Valletta. I sat next to the film\u2019s military advisor and, as we walked out together down the (quite dark) stairwell, I bumped into a familiar figure. Blond, with a back-to-front baseball cap, I recognised (or thought I did) Garrett Hedlund, the young actor who played Patroclus. In the film, Patroclus was portrayed not as Achilles\u2019 lover but as his cousin, so Garrett had been chosen partly because of a general resemblance to Brad Pitt. You see where this is going. I\u2019d met him a few times, so I said to him, \u2018Hi. How are you?\u2019 He said he was fine and asked how I was. I said fine, too, then I said, \u2018Are you coming on to this salsa club now?\u2019 because that was the general plan. He said he was, so I said \u2018See you there\u2019 and he said \u2018Yes, see you there.\u2019\nThen the military adviser said to me, \u2018Do you know who you were just talking to?\u2019 I said \u2018Garrett Hedlund,\u2019 and he said \u2018No\u2026\u2019\n\u2026 and that was when I realised I had made a date with Brad Pitt!\n\nThe BP exhibition Troy: myth and reality ran from 21 November 2019 \u2013 8 March 2020.\nBuy the book accompanying the exhibition here.\nSupported by BP"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/women-and-goddesses-of-the-trojan-war/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Women and goddesses of the Trojan War", "author": "Natalie Haynes", "timestamp": "2019-11-22 00:00:00", "text": "The story of the Trojan War is one of the foundational myths of Western culture. Two of the world\u2019s oldest poems, Homer\u2019s\u00a0Iliad and\u00a0Odyssey, take it as their inspiration.\u00a0The\u00a0Iliad is set in the 10th year of the war, the\u00a0Odyssey in the aftermath as its hero, Odysseus, spends 10 more years trying to get home. These epics are both stories of men and each one begins with an appeal to tell the story of the hero. Achilles and his unquenchable rage is established as the theme of the\u00a0Iliad from its opening line: \u201cRage \u2013 Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus\u2019 son Achilles.\u201d Whatever else we\u2019re expecting to hear in this poem \u2013 the fighting among mortals and immortals \u2013 in the end, it will all come down to one man and his rage.\nDetail of a wine mixing bowl showing Achilles fighting Hector. c. 490 BC.\nAnd yet, Achilles is not the first character mentioned in this poem \u2013 the first person referred to in the\u00a0Iliad\u00a0is a goddess, presumably the divine muse, Calliope, who has a particular interest in epic poetry. The first word of the\u00a0Odyssey is andra (man) \u2013\u00a0\u00a0but the rest of the opening line is clear about who knows his story, and it is neither the hero nor the poet \u201cTell me, muse, about a complicated man.\u201d In other words, the first lines of each poem tell us something quite subtle \u2013 their subjects may be men, but it is a female deity that the poet must appeal to if he wants to tell the men\u2019s stories. Women are woven into the fabric of the Trojan War just as much as the male heroes who get top billing. So isn\u2019t it time we turned our attention to them too?\nPrint showing the\u00a0muses\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0Roman\u00a0goddess\u00a0Minerva. School of Andrea Meldolla,\u00a0c. 1540\u20131563.\nHelen of Troy\nThere is only one character involved in the entire war who is so integral to it that they have acquired the epithet \u2018of Troy,\u2019 and that is Helen. She is not born Helen of Troy, rather she becomes it when she elopes or is taken (depending on the version of the myth we read) by Paris, a Trojan prince. Helen begins her life as Helen of Sparta, after the city in southern Greece. She is the daughter of Zeus \u2013 king of the gods \u2013 and Leda, queen of Sparta. The common perception of her (informed by authors from Homer to Marlowe) as destructively beautiful (hers was the face that launched a thousand ships) overlooks important elements of her story.\nSir Edward John Poynter, Helen, 1887. Royal Collection Trust /\n\u00a9 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2019.\nHelen is kidnapped as a child by king Theseus (the mythical founder of Athens), many years after his minotaur-killing. It is one of his less heroic exploits (even ancient authors, whose attitudes to sex were very different from our own, were uncomfortable about a man in his fifties taking a child bride). Helen\u2019s brothers declare war on Athens to reclaim their sister. In some versions of the story, Helen bears Theseus a child before she is returned home to Sparta.\nUrn depicting the abduction of Helen by Paris, 125\u2013100 BC.\nWhen she is older, Helen marries the king of Sparta, Menelaus. Then Paris turns up and takes her (willingly or unwillingly \u2013 again, it depends on the version of the story we read) back with him to Troy. Menelaus and the Greeks are outraged and pursue her with more than a thousand ships \u2013 Homer lists nearly 1,200 in the Iliad. This poem presents us with a Helen who regrets that Paris is not a better man and reproaches herself for her own behaviour. It\u2019s not enough to win over her mother-in-law, Hecuba. In Euripides\u2019 play, The Trojan Women, set in the immediate aftermath of the fall of Troy, Hecuba tells Menelaus that she would praise him if he killed Helen. Helen then issues a spirited defence of herself, pointing out the undeniable truth \u2013 that Hecuba blames Helen for the war, rather than her own son, Paris.\nEdward Burne-Jones, Helen\u2019s Tears, 1882\u20131898.\nHecuba, queen of Troy\nIt is a pity that Hecuba, the queen of Troy, isn\u2019t better known to modern audiences. Euripides\u2019 play about her was enormously popular in Shakespeare\u2019s time (which is why Hamlet can ask, \u2018What\u2019s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba?\u2019). The queen of Troy is a survivor, a devastated widow and mother to many murdered sons, and a terrible example of the brutality of war. Euripides\u2019 Hecuba reveals one last, terrible shock in the immediate aftermath of the fall of her city \u2013 she discovers that her youngest son, Polydorus, has been murdered by Polymestor, King of Thrace, to whom she sent her son for safekeeping during the war.\nPrint showing Hecuba (in the hooded drapery) and Hector\u2019s wife Andromache weeping over the ashes of Hector. After Angelica Kauffman, c. 1771.\nThis final trauma is too much for Hecuba to bear, and she commits one of the most horrifying acts of revenge in all Greek tragedy and, possibly, in all theatre. Hecuba and her women kill the two children of Polymestor, the man who has killed her son. Then they pull out his eyes with brooch pins. It is a breathtakingly brutal response \u2013 the last thing this treacherous man will ever see is the murder of his sons in revenge for his own vicious crime. Modern theatre productions often struggle to show a woman doing something so unmaternal, indeed anti-maternal, as kill children (there is a tendency for them to imply the women are mad, which is not in the Greek text). But while it is a shocking scene, it is also an extraordinary one. A group of enslaved war-widows taking revenge on one Greek man and his children for all the sons, husbands and freedoms they themselves have lost. Women using knives to kill children is a particularly macabre distortion of the norms of combat (men killing other men with sword and spear-blades) in the war which has just come to an end.\nAmphora (storage jar) showing the death of king Priam. Hecuba stands beside her husband with her right hand raised to tear her hair and her left hand in an entreaty to her husband\u2019s killer. c. 550\u2013540 BC.\nPenthesilea, queen of the Amazons\nIn fact, these norms have already been subverted in the final year of the war, when the Amazons arrive. Penthesilea and her warrior women turn up to fight alongside the Trojans against the Greeks. The Amazons were fascinating to ancient artists. They are the most frequently-painted characters found on Greek pots after Heracles (or Hercules, to give him his more common Roman name). The idea of female warriors was both compelling and troubling to ancient audiences \u2013 war was (and still is) a traditionally masculine sphere. However, the images of fallen Amazons being carried off the battlefield by their combatants, the Greeks, are beautiful, which is not the way fallen enemies are usually treated, either in poems or in the visual arts. Respect for one\u2019s enemy didn\u2019t go as far as carrying them from the battlefield. It didn\u2019t always go as far as not desecrating their corpses. They were clearly admired.\nEngraving of a sculpted bust of the Amazon queen Penthesilea, c. 1550.\nPenthesilea fights Achilles in single combat, replicating the great climactic battle of the Iliad, between Achilles and Hector (the great Trojan hero), which had taken place a few weeks or months earlier. We would know her story better if the epic poem in which she played a major role, the Aethiopis, survived to the present day. As it is, we know that she fought Achilles and lost her life. This puts her on an equal footing with virtually everyone else who fought the demigod Achilles. Hector was the greatest Trojan warrior and even he was killed after only a brief fight with the murderous Greek.\nAmphora (storage jar) showing Achilles killing the Amazon queen, Penthesilea. c. 530 BC.\nSo there is no disgrace in Penthesilea\u2019s defeat. She is brave enough to fight Achilles and she loses, like everyone else. The difference is that her story has so rarely been told. And when it has been told, it has been sexualised. When Robert Graves told the story of Penthesilea in the 20th century, he robbed her of her warrior prowess so he could eroticise her corpse (on which his version of Achilles masturbates). Sometimes, it\u2019s hard to see progress.\nLaodamia\nOne poet who eroticised women in his art (and probably also in his life) is also responsible for one of the saddest, most beautiful stories of a woman whose life is uprooted by the Trojan War. Ovid writes a poem in the form of a letter from Laodamia to her husband, Protesilaos. Protesilaos is the first of the Greeks to land at Troy, and the first to die. Ovid\u2019s letter from the widow to her beloved husband is almost unbearably touching. Quite aside from anything else, it is extraordinary that a man whose poetic persona trades on being flirtatious at best, and a sexual predator at worst, sets aside his manliness to write as a woman. In fact, it is a whole collection of poems from abandoned women and is a remarkable act of literary ventriloquy. Incidentally you can see a statue of Protesilaos \u2013 his beautiful feet poised to jump from his ship \u2013 in the British Museum.\nStatue of Protesilaos striding along a ship\u2019s prow. Roman copy of a Greek original dating to c. 450\u2013430 BC.\nAphrodite, goddess of love\nThese are just a handful of the mortal women whose lives are damaged by the Trojan War. But immortal women are just as important to the war as their human counterparts. When Paris arrives in Sparta to seduce Helen, he tells her that he is claiming her as his rightful prize, awarded to him by the goddess Aphrodite. Paris had been given the unenviable task of deciding which goddess \u2013 Athena, Hera or Aphrodite \u2013 should be awarded a golden apple on which is inscribed the Greek phrase, \u201cTe kalliste\u201d or \u201cFor the most beautiful\u201d. Each goddess tries to bribe him. Hera offers him a kingdom, Athena offers him success in war, Aphrodite offers him Helen. Paris chooses Aphrodite and so feels entitled to claim Helen as his wife. The fact that she is married is inconsequential to Paris. In fact, he is also already married, although his first wife, Oenone, takes her abandonment somewhat less aggressively than Menelaus does, as she chooses to raise her son independently rather than launch an invasion.\nLucas Cranach the Elder (1472\u20131553), The Judgement of Paris, c. 1530\u20131535.\nSo it could legitimately be argued that Aphrodite is responsible for causing the Trojan War. She\u2019s the one who promises an already married woman to an already married man. But perhaps the blame really lies with the goddess who produces the golden apple which Aphrodite, Athena and Hera argue over. That goddess is Eris \u2013 Discord \u2013 who feeds on conflict. We might also remember Thetis, the sea nymph who is the mother of Achilles. Without her involvement (trying to protect her son), the war might have been over a great deal sooner, with less loss of life.\nSitula (bucket) showing Paris coming to abduct Helen as Aphrodite watches on. 350\u2013340 BC.\nPenelope\nNot every woman involved in the Trojan War narrative is affected by it so directly \u2013 the ripples of the conflict spread across oceans. In the case of Penelope, the wife of Odysseus, for example, the war is a waiting game. Penelope spends the 10 years of the war, plus the 10 years of Odysseus\u2019 journey home, waiting patiently for him on their island home on Ithaca. His return journey involves so many female characters \u2013 from Circe to Calypso, Scylla to Charybdis \u2013 that one quirky, satirical writer in the 19th century suggested the author of the Odyssey must have been a woman. Sadly, there is no evidence for any woman working as a performing poet at the time Homer was composing the Odyssey, whoever Homer was and however many poets he may have \u2018been\u2019 (the Iliad and Odyssey were oral compositions, so numerous poets might have been involved).\nRoman relief showing Penelope mournfully waiting for her long-absent husband. Italy, c. 30 BC\u2013AD 50.\nPenelope\u2019s faithfulness to Odysseus, no matter how long he takes to return home and how many women he dallies with on that voyage, was a source of great inspiration to ancient authors. Penelope is held up as an example of fidelity, unlike Helen, and loyalty \u2013 unlike Helen\u2019s sister, Clytemnestra, who murders her husband, Agamemnon, on his return home from the war. Penelope\u2019s home is invaded by a raft of young men all vying to marry her, because her husband has been gone for so long that they believe he must be dead. Yet she holds them off \u2013 one woman defending her home against a huge number of men.\nRoman head of Penelope, AD 1\u2013100. Berlin, Antikensammlung.\nIf anyone\u2019s story tells us that we have underestimated the women of the Trojan War, it is surely Penelope. But she is only one of dozens of women in this myth who have been ignored or forgotten for millennia. It\u2019s time we told their stories again.\nThe BP exhibition Troy: myth and reality ran from 21 November 2019 \u2013 8 March 2020.\nBuy the book accompanying the exhibition here."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/art-in-crisis-identifying-and-returning-looted-objects/", "category": "News", "title": "Art in crisis: identifying and returning looted objects", "author": "St John Simpson, Assistant Keeper in the Middle East Department, British Museum", "timestamp": "2019-11-05 00:00:00", "text": "In 2001 the Taliban government of Afghanistan banned all representations of the human form, from depictions on TV and in painting to ancient sculpture. Statues in the National Museum of Afghanistan were decapitated and the famous Buddhas of Bamiyan were blown up. Many other ancient monuments across the country were also damaged at this time and it was probably during these months that another group of beautiful Buddhist sculptures was deliberately broken. Local dealers were afraid to handle such objects, but once the Taliban were overthrown later that year, these pieces were collected and smuggled out via Pakistan.\nThe looting of archaeological sites is a huge problem around the world and is particularly bad during periods of economic and political crisis. The British Museum works very closely with UK law enforcement agencies and countries worldwide to help fight the illicit export and sale of antiquities on the black market. Since 2009 the Museum has helped return 2,345 objects to Afghanistan, Iraq and Uzbekistan \u2013 mostly the result of illegal trafficking. This includes the identification, cataloguing and return of thousands of antiquities of all periods to Afghanistan, many others to Iraq and a monumental glazed medieval tile to Uzbekistan. A few weeks ago the Museum opened a new changing case display at the top of the East Stairs (Room 53) which focuses on this work. The first to be displayed are those very same Buddhist sculptures from Afghanistan that were damaged almost two decades ago. They will be on display until late December and then be returned to the National Museum of Afghanistan in Kabul.\nSeized Buddhist sculptures go on temporary display in a case in Room 53.\nThe sculptures were seized in the UK as part of an operation involving the Art and Antiques Unit of the Metropolitan Police and brought to the Museum for identification. They date from between the fourth and sixth centuries AD when Buddhism was the main religion in Afghanistan and the region was first under the rule of the Sasanian empire, centred on present-day Iran and Iraq.\nThe largest sculpture is carved from grey schist (a type of stone) and is of a princely figure wearing elaborate necklaces with a so-called \u2018wet drapery\u2019 carving effect seen on his clinging robes. He is a bodhisattva \u2013 a person who wishes to become as enlightened as Buddha. The material and style are typical of the Gandhara region of present-day Swat in Pakistan but such pieces were exported in antiquity and set up in monasteries as far away as Merv in present-day Turkmenistan.\nGandharan sculpture of a male bodhisattva.\nThe nine other pieces that were seized are made of coarse clay wrapped in a finer material resembling stucco plaster which has been finely modelled and painted. They are mostly representations of bodhisattvas, some wearing elaborate diadems (crowns) and shown in a variety of styles. They closely resemble pieces excavated in monasteries at Hadda, near Jalalabad, and on one of the key routes connecting Afghanistan with Pakistan, via the Khyber Pass. However, it is not known where exactly the present pieces were found and another possibility is that they come from illicit excavations at one of the ancient monasteries in the Mes Aynak area south of Kabul.\nRescue excavations in this area have revealed spectacular remains, including a polychrome Gandharan schist sculpture, the first wooden carving of a Buddha from this period, and many painted clay and stucco representations in different styles. There is an enticing angle to this possibility, as this is one of the areas where the late Osama bin Laden is rumoured to have been headquartered \u2013 Buddhist art would hardly have been tolerated and it was as a result of his influence that the Taliban hardened their attitudes to figural imagery in 2001.\nMoulded and painted clay head of a female bodhisattva wearing a diadem (crown).\nCT scans \u2013 conducted by the Museum\u2019s Department of Conservation and Scientific Research \u2013 have revealed how these heads were made, and scientific analysis shows that the red and yellow pigments found on the heads were made from common iron-rich ores. Such sculptures were commonly painted but so far there has not been much scientific work published on the subject. The rediscovery of the sculptures was a good opportunity to conduct this work and we are very grateful to the National Museum of Afghanistan for permitting us to do so.\nAn X-ray CT scan of the head reveals a two-layered construction: a coarse clay was used to roughly model the shape of the head. The face, hair and headdress were overlaid with a finer and more compact material which was then painted.\nScientific analyses showed that a red paint, rich in iron oxide, was applied over a carbon black layer to deepen the hue. The right image shows how enhancement techniques help visualise the remains of this paint.\nThe British Museum has a long and strong relationship with the National Museum of Afghanistan as our experts helped to build their first conservation laboratory and, in 2009, we returned more than three tons of antiquities seized in the UK over several years. These ranged from third-millennium-BC bronze cosmetic containers and other objects looted from Bronze Age cemeteries in northern Afghanistan (known as Bactria) to medieval metalware looted from other sites.\nSome of these objects were put on display soon after in the National Museum of Afghanistan\u2019s newly restored galleries. Discussions continued and in 2011 I curated a very successful exhibition called Afghanistan: Crossroads of the Ancient World. It was humbling to work with their curators and conservators as these were some of the people known as key-holders who had moved and concealed their most valuable objects during the dreadful civil war of 1992\u20131994 and kept their location secret until the Taliban government was overthrown and the government of former President Hamid Karzai installed in December 2001. When we were installing some of the loaned objects, the director and staff of the National Museum of Afghanistan gave permission for us to scientifically analyse some of the loans and the British Museum also signed an agreement pledging co-operation over the identification and return of looted or stolen antiquities.\nMain entrance of the fully restored National Museum of Afghanistan in Kabul.\nThat year, thanks to the generosity of the art dealer John Eskenazi and additional support from the exhibition sponsor Bank of America Merrill Lynch as part of its Art Conservation Project,\u00a0we were also able to accept, conserve, analyse and exhibit a spectacular group of 20 carved ivory and bone furniture overlays. These date to the first century AD and had been excavated in the 1940s by a French expedition to the ancient city at Begram. These had been stolen from the museum in Kabul during the civil war and had previously been feared lost forever. We published a small book on these pieces, as well as two journal articles and a long monograph, and sent the objects back to Kabul in 2012, where they are safe.\nWhile we were getting ready for President Karzai to open this exhibition, we were told of the whereabouts of another famous stolen antiquity. This is popularly known as the \u2018fire Buddha\u2019 and is a monumental sculpture found in 1965 at Sarai Khuja, north of Kabul. It was exhibited in the museum in Kabul until it was wrenched from the wall one night in 1996. It transpired that it had entered a private collection in Japan and, after much discussion, it was very generously acquired on behalf of the National Museum of Afghanistan by John Eskenazi who presented it in memory of the late Carla Grissman (1928\u20132011), who did much to work with the Afghan museum staff and who was one of the founding members of SPACH (Society for the Preservation of Afghanistan\u2019s Cultural Heritage).\nThe \u2018fire Buddha\u2019 goes on display on the main staircase in the National Museum of Afghanistan. \u00a9 Andy Miller.\nSince then we have continued to keep a vigilant eye open for other objects which could have come to the UK illegally from Afghanistan. In 2015 a German couple, Patrick and Paola von Aulock, offered to sell (through Christie\u2019s auction house) a decorated tinned copper wine-bowl dated by its inscription to the year 1604\u20131605. Christie\u2019s quickly identified it as having been catalogued and published, as early as 1974, as being part of the Kabul museum collection. As the owners had bought it in 1994 from an Afghan dealer in Jeddah, it must have quickly made its way there soon after the civil war looting of the museum after 1992. The owners generously agreed to present it back to the National Museum of Afghanistan, where it is now on display in their new Islamic gallery.\nThe British Museum\u2019s current display in Room 53 is the latest episode in this story \u2013 watch this space for the latest developments.\nTo\u00a0find\u00a0out\u00a0more\u00a0about\u00a0objects\u00a0from\u00a0Afghanistan\u00a0and\u00a0the return of looted\u00a0antiquities,\u00a0take a look at\u00a0these\u00a0publications:\nSt John Simpson, \u2018Stolen, saved, returned: collaboration between the NMA, BM, UK Border Force, and others in the successful return of antiquities to Kabul\u2019, Preserving the Cultural Heritage of Afghanistan.

Ten years ago, an exhibition at the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia also examined these influences, focusing on the decorative arts of East and West. There were two ingredients missing then. The first was paintings, the second was the British Museum.\nWhat we have now with this exhibition is a true collaboration between two institutions half way across the globe. By bringing these two museums and their collections together, we hope to present an updated study of the nexus between East and West. It is not an entirely new understanding, but rather more an analysis of different understandings \u2013 and misunderstandings \u2013 over the centuries.\nThe Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia\u2019s chief purpose is to highlight not just the achievements of Islamic culture, but its influence across generations. The museum looks back 1,400 years to Mecca, a cultural meeting place as complex as any in the 21st century. Inspired by the east focuses instead on 500 years of more recent encounters.\nModel of the Alhambra \u2013 the fortified palace in Granada, southern Spain, built by its last Muslim rulers during the 1300s.\nDiego Ferna\u0301ndez Castro (b. 1847) late 19th century. Wood, enamel, plaster, bone inlay, alabaster. \u00a9 Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia\nTravel has changed a lot during this period \u2013 and so has the concept of the \u2018East.\u2019 For the purposes of this exhibition, the concept of the \u2018East\u2019 refers to the Middle East and North Africa. Some 19th century Western artists travelled or lived among Muslim communities. Others never strayed far from the comfort of their studios. Both categories of artists created works that enabled the growing population of Europe and America to see many different \u2018Orients\u2019. Most of the paintings struck a chord with Western audiences. Many showed a world that was worthy of respect. Such was its impact that a few of these Western travellers even converted to Islam after their exposure to the Muslim world, such as Nasreddine Dinet \u2013 a French artist formerly known as Alphonse Etienne Dinet.\nAt Prayer, Ludwig Deutsch (1855\u20131935), 1923 . Oil on panel.\n\u00a9 Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia\nThese \u2018Orientalist\u2019 artists were then ignored for decades. But, at the same time that Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said\u2019s book Orientalism was published in 1978, it became clear that the paintings he disapproved of were growing in popularity again.\nDuring the late 20th century, it was the works of art themselves \u2013 rather than the unfavourable comments about the artists \u2013 that reawakened the interest of collectors around the world. This was especially true of the Islamic world. The numerous depictions of Muslims and their culture show that it was not all about negative stereotypes, generalisations or romanticisation. Through this exhibition both our museums are instead attempting to show a quest for understanding. Then, as now, art was a vehicle of wonder, admiration and enlightenment.\n\nFrederick Arthur Bridgman (1847\u20131928),\u00a0The Prayer. Oil on canvas, 1877.\n\u00a9 Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia\nThese works of art have come almost full circle. What began as an inspiration to early western travellers and others encountering the Islamic world has led to these beautiful artworks, these impressions of the Orient. And these are what they are, impressions. Through this exhibition, we hope to shed light and perspective, both from the Western observer\u2019s point of view, and the Eastern-observed point of view, through the various objects that form the basis of this inspiration. And the range is enormous, from a painting by Frederick Arthur Bridgman of The Prayer to the Turkish Orientalist artist Osman Hamdi Bey\u2019s Girl Reciting Qu\u2019ran; from a 16th-century Iznik plate to a 19th-century near-perfect copy of the same plate by Theodore Deck.

With the British Museum, as well as other significant British institutions \u2013 and the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia each providing half of the objects displayed in this exhibition, as well as half of the curatorial direction \u2013 it is beyond doubt that the title is apt.\nThe British Museum has a historic collection, ours is more recent. It is all the more pertinent, in this increasingly divisive world, that museums work together and play a bigger role in bridging that gap, no longer confining themselves to just being storehouses of the world\u2019s cultural heritage alone. But instead, to present an impartial and fair narrative of the past, to focus on humanity rather than preconceptions, in order to instill respect and promote understanding of different cultures.\nEarly portrait medal of Muhammad Shah (ruled 1834\u20131848), 1835\u20131840.

Situated in the west-central part of the country, Nara was the eastern terminus of the Silks Roads that brought Buddhism to Japan, transforming indigenous society. \u00a0The great Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines of the city were founded in this early period and have an unbroken tradition of some 13 centuries to the present day. In 1180 and again in 1567, great destruction was suffered during civil wars, but each time the city and its great religious institutions have risen again from the ashes \u2013 rebuilt thanks to the generosity of thousands of pious donors.

Sculptures and paintings complement each another and give a rounder and deeper appreciation of this ancient city and its remarkable history. In recent years I have worked on exhibitions featuring the art of more recent periods \u2013 shunga, Hokusai and manga \u2013 so it is rewarding to go back to more ancient roots of Japanese culture.\n2. Buddha at Birth and ablution basin, AD 700s, gilt bronze, T\u014ddaiji temple, Nara, National Treasure. Photo provided by Nara National Museum (photographer: Sasaki Kyosuke).\nSymbolic of Nara and its periodic renewal is the imposing 15-metre-high bronze Vairocana Buddha of T\u014ddaiji temple, originally consecrated by Emperor Sh\u014dmu in AD 752, and recast and re-consecrated after each great fire (image 1\u00a0above). Amazingly, Birth of the Buddha and ablution basin (image 2\u00a0above) may actually have been used at the original consecration. Scented water was poured over the Buddha figure into the basin, evoking the bathing of a new-born baby.\n3. Bodhisattva of Compassion of the Never-Empty Noose (J. Fuk\u016bkensaku Kannon) with two guardian deities. Ink, colour and gold on silk, 13th century.\nThe special Nara displays are shown in two key spaces at the Museum: The Asahi Shimbun Displays in Room 3, and the Mitsubishi Corporation Japanese Galleries, Rooms 92\u201394. 15 extraordinary treasures have been loaned by Nara, dating from about AD 600 to 1400, including no less than five classified as National Treasures and six as Important Cultural Properties. Intermingled with these are eight fine medieval Nara paintings from the British Museum\u2019s own collection (image 3\u00a0above).\nThrough these sacred treasures we can tell the stirring stories of the great Nara temples and shrines. We can also give glimpses into the intricate hierarchy of Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the great Buddhist religion that was introduced to Japan from China and Korea around the 6th century AD. Admirably, Buddhism soon found accommodation with indigenous Japanese beliefs in the spirits of nature and ancestors, known as kami\u00ad worship (modern Shinto). Over time, native kami came to be regarded as local manifestations\u00a0, avatars and protectors of the \u2018original Buddhas\u2019 (honjibutsu).\n4. Kasuga shrine and temple mandala.

Sacred deer of Kasuga shrine, 1300s, gilt-bronze, Nara National Museum. Collection of Nara National Museum (photographer: Morimura Kinji).\n6. Sacred Nara deer.\nBy the early medieval period, sacred Mount Kasuga and its shrine-temple came to be regarded as a paradise. Beneath the mountains lay hell. The deer that still wander freely in the area today have a special significance as messengers of the Kasuga deity (image 5, image 6\u00a0both\u00a0above).\n7. Bodhisattva, AD early 600s, gilt bronze, H\u014dry\u016bji temple, Nara prefecture, Important Cultural Property. Photo provided by Nara National Museum (photographer: Morimura Kinji).\nGoing further back by more than half a millennium to the roots of sacred imagery in Nara, The Asahi Shimbun Displays in Room 3 feature works from the oldest surviving Buddhist temple in the area, H\u014dry\u016bji, temple of the exalted law. Originally a temple alongside the Ikaruga palace of Prince Sh\u014dtoku (Sh\u014dtoku Taishi, AD 574\u2013622), the complex was rebuilt as H\u014dry\u016bji following a fire of AD 670. Enshrined in the Golden Hall of the West Precinct is a famous gilt-bronze Shaka (Sakyamuni Buddha) triad made by sculptor Tori and dated equivalent to AD 623. The earlier of the two bodhisattva statues loaned to the Museum by H\u014dry\u016bji is similar in style to the attendant bodhisattvas of the Tori triad and was likely cast in the same sculpture workshop (image 7\u00a0above).\n8. Bodhisattva of Compassion (Dream-changing Kannon), gilt bronze, AD late 600s \u2013 early 700s. H\u014dry\u016bji temple, National Treasure.

Ink and colour on silk, Dunhuang, Gansu province, China, AD 910.\nWith regular embassies travelling to Korea and China, new styles of continental Asian Buddhist art were regularly arriving in Japan around the Nara period (AD 710\u2013794). The second of the two bodhisattva sculptures loaned by H\u014dry\u016bji was made in a more advanced, naturalistic style \u2013 the silk scarves seem about to slip off the figure\u2019s slender body (image 8\u00a0above). Since the 1690s when it was loaned for display in Edo (modern-day Tokyo), this image of Bodhisattva Kannon, the deity of compassion, has been said to have the power to change bad dreams into good ones. Just how international Buddhist art was in the early period is demonstrated by comparison with a brilliantly coloured Chinese painting of the same deity, Guanyin in Chinese, done in almost the same style, which was discovered in the Mogao cave shrines at distant Dunhuang, on the Silk Roads of central Asia (image 9\u00a0above).\n10. Copy of a wall painting from the Golden Hall of H\u014dry\u016bji temple, attributed to Sakurai K\u014dun (1840\u2013c.1895). Ink and colour on paper, about 1879.\nAlso displayed in Room 3 is a gigantic (4m x 3m) hanging scroll which shows the paradise of a Buddha, probably Miroku (Maitreya), the Buddha of the Future (image 10\u00a0above). This is a copy that was taken directly from frescoes dating from the late AD 600s or early 700s that adorn the walls of the Golden Hall at H\u014dry\u016bji. The copy was commissioned by UK diplomat Sir Ernest Satow (1843\u20131929) and almost immediately given by him to surgeon William Anderson (1842\u20131900), whose painting collection came to the British Museum in 1881. The two men had visited H\u014dry\u016bji together in 1879, meaning that the copy was then almost brand new. The original wall painting was tragically damaged by fire in 1949, so this early copy has additional historical value. The copy, made by painter Sakurai K\u014dun (1840\u20131895) on thin but sturdy paper, was rediscovered in the Museum\u2019s collection in 2007 by Princess Akiko of Mikasa, while she was studying at Oxford. Recently it has been made into a hanging scroll suitable for display by conservation specialists in the Museum\u2019s purpose-built Hirayama Studio, working together with colleagues from Japan.\n11.

Photo \u00a9 Bijyutsuin.\nFinally, let\u2019s take a look at Prince Sh\u014dtoku, previously mentioned as the founder of what became H\u014dryuji. Serving as regent to his aunt Empress Suiko (AD 554\u2013628), the prince was an early champion of Buddhism in Japan \u2013 to the degree that in the medieval period he himself became the focus of a religious cult. Also loaned by H\u014dryuji is the earliest sculpted portrait image of the prince, made by sculptor Enkai, decorated by painter Hata no Chitei, and dated equivalent to AD 1069 (image 11\u00a0above). Historically, the statue was paraded on a palanquin and entertained by musicians and dancers, in the sh\u014dry\u014d-e ritual that consoled the faithful by behaving as if the prince was still alive. Displayed alongside is a painted portrait of the prince, also shown as a youth with long plaits, holding out a censer (dispenser of incense) and praying for the recovery from illness of his father Emperor Y\u014dmei (AD 518\u2013587) (image 12\u00a0below). (This hanging scroll has also recently been extensively conserved and remounted in the Hirayama Studio.)\n12. Prince Sh\u014dtoku.

However, the gods were warned of a prophecy that Thetis would have a son who would grow up to be greater than his father. Worried by this, Zeus arranged for Thetis to marry a mortal man so that her child couldn\u2019t challenge his power. In another version of the story, Thetis rejects Zeus\u2019s advances and a furious Zeus decrees that she will never marry a god. Either way, Thetis ends up married to the mortal Peleus and Achilles is born.\nTerracotta relief showing Peleus and Thetis, c. 490\u2013470 BC. Thetis tries to resist marriage to Peleus by transforming her body into powerful elements such as fire and wild beasts, here a lion.\nWhat\u2019s the story of his \u2018Achilles heel\u2019?\nThetis gives birth to Achilles who, unlike her, is mortal. She attempts to make the baby Achilles immortal, by dipping him in the River Styx (the river that runs through the underworld), while holding him by his heel. The one part of his body left untouched by the waters becomes his only point of weakness, hence the phrase \u2018Achilles heel\u2019.\nThomas Banks RA, Thetis and Achilles, 1789. \u00a9 Victoria and Albert Museum, London.\nIn the Iliad there is no mention of Achilles\u2019 invulnerability or the weakness of his heel. In scenes representing his death in Greek art, he has been shown with an arrow in his torso, as well as his heel. This may indicate that the \u2018Achilles heel\u2019 story is a later addition to the myth.\nThe story reveals the sadness of a mother who knows that, being immortal, she will outlive her son.\nWhy was Achilles raised by a centaur?\nAchilles\u2019 mother Thetis abandons her husband and son to return to live with the sea nymphs when Achilles is still young. Needing some help raising Achilles, Peleus sends him to be educated by a centaur named Chiron.\nCentaurs, who have the upper body of a human and the lower body and legs of a horse, are often represented in Greek art as violent and savage creatures, but Chiron was known for his wisdom and had educated other heroes including Heracles and Jason.\nAchilles instructed by Chiron in the Management of the Javelin. Print after Giovanni Battista Cipriani, 1789.\n\nUnder the care of Chiron, Achilles is fed a diet that includes the innards of lions and wild pigs, and the marrow of she-wolves, to make him strong. Chiron teaches the young Achilles hunting as well as music and intellectual pursuits.\nEug\u00e8ne Delacroix, The Education of Achilles, c. 1862. Pastel on paper.\nGetty Center, Los Angeles.\nDid Achilles have a male lover?\nAs a boy, Achilles develops a close relationship with another boy named Patroclus, who joins Achilles\u2019 household as an exile, having accidentally killed another child. They become friends and possibly lovers. In Homer\u2019s Iliad, Achilles describes Patroclus as \u2018the man I loved beyond all other comrades, loved as my own life\u2019.\nDrinking cup showing Achilles bandaging Patroclus\u2019 wound. c. 500 BC.\n\u00a9ANTIKENSAMMLUNG, STAATLICHE MUSEEN ZU BERLIN\n-PREUSSISCHER KULTURBESITZ- Photo: Johannes Laurentius.\nAlthough Homer doesn\u2019t explicitly cast them as lovers, their intimate relationship is crucial to the plot of the Iliad, and in other works of ancient literature the relationship between the two men is more explicitly referenced as a love affair. In ancient Greece it was common for men to have sexual relationships with both men and women. There were no words in ancient Greek for \u2018homosexual\u2019 and \u2018heterosexual\u2019 and in classical Athens relationships between older, often married, men and younger men were a normal part of social life.\nWhy did Achilles\u2019 parents try to stop him going to Troy?\nA prophecy had foretold that Achilles would die at Troy, so when the Greek leaders gather for their campaign to return the abducted Helen, Achilles\u2019 parents attempt to prevent him joining the expedition. He is hidden on the island of Skyros, disguised as a girl at the court of King Lycomedes among his numerous daughters.\nRoman sarcophagus relief, depicting Achilles (centre) holding a helmet among the daughters of Lycomedes AD 150\u2013200.\nHowever, due to another prophecy, the Greeks know they can only win the war with Achilles\u2019 help. The Greek kings Odysseus and Diomedes discover his whereabouts and trick him into revealing himself so he can join the troops on the expedition to Troy. Disguised as travelling salesmen, they visit the court with jewellery and women\u2019s clothes. Amongst these goods they place weapons, which Achilles instinctively grabs and is found out.\nAchilles wearing a dress as a disguise unsheaths a sword and is recognised. Etching after Peter Paul Rubens, 1630\u20131645.\nWhat did Achilles do in the Trojan War?\nAchilles arrives at Troy with 50 ships. He is the leader of the army known as the Myrmidons and is the best fighter on the side of the Greeks.\nStorage jar showing Ajax (left) and Achilles (right) playing a game. 530\u2013520 BC.\nTroy is a well-defended city and nine long years of siege follow. The epic poem which covered this part of the war (the Cypria) does not survive, so its events are known in much less detail. In art, a popular scene was that of Achilles playing a board game with the hero Ajax. The image suggests that the Greek heroes spent many long hours whiling away the time during the siege of Troy. Things only really get interesting during the 10th year of the war, which is the focus for Homer\u2019s Iliad.\nWhat caused \u2018the rage of Achilles\u2019?\nThe anger or rage of Achilles is a key theme of Homer\u2019s Iliad. In fact \u2018anger\u2019 is the first word of the whole poem.\n\nAchilles is initially angry because the leader of the Greek forces, King Agamemnon, takes a captive woman named Briseis from him. Early Greek society was highly competitive and a man\u2019s honour was vital to his sense of identity and position. By taking away the prize of honour that has been allocated to Achilles in recognition of his fighting prowess, Agamemnon dishonours him.\n\nDrinking cup showing Briseis being taken from Achilles, who is depicted sulking with his cloak wrapped around him. c. 480 BC.\nAchilles withdraws from battle and refuses to fight. When the Trojans make gains in the battle, Agamemnon agrees to send an embassy to Achilles to try to persuade him to re-join the fighting by offering him a wealth of gifts. Achilles remains unmoved but does allow his friend Patroclus to lead the Myrmidons into battle wearing Achilles\u2019 armour.\nHenry Fuseli (1741\u20131825), Achilles Lamenting for Patroclus. Drawing, 1770.\nPatroclus is killed in the bloody fighting by the Trojan prince Hector, who mistakes him for Achilles, and the real Achilles is utterly distraught. His mother, Thetis, consoles him and Achilles declares his intention to kill Hector and avenge the death of Patroclus, despite his weeping mother\u2019s revelation that, according to fate, his own death will soon follow that of Hector.\nHow does Achilles avenge Patroclus\u2019 death?\nAchilles is determined to avenge Patroclus\u2019 death at any cost and announces that he is ending his anger against Agamemnon and will re-join the fighting. The two sides meet in battle and Hector waits outside the city gates, ready to fight Achilles.\n\nDetail of a wine mixing bowl showing Achilles fighting Hector. c. 490 BC.\nAchilles chases Hector around the wall of the city, then the two heroes fight, and Achilles plunges his spear into Hector\u2019s neck. As he lies dying, Hector appeals to Achilles to return his body for cremation \u2013 a request that is heartlessly refused \u2013 and with his last breath he prophesies Achilles\u2019 own death at the hands of the Trojan prince Paris.\nPietro Testa (1611\u20131650), Achilles dragging the body of Hector around the walls of Troy.

After the death of Hector, the Trojans, with their best fighter dead, call on their allies to help them defeat the Greeks. The Ethiopian King Memnon brings his army to support the Trojans, but is killed by Achilles in battle. Achilles also faces the Amazons \u2013 the tribe of female warriors \u2013 and fights their leader, Queen Penthesilea. At the moment Achilles kills her with his spear, their eyes meet and he falls in love with her, too late.\nStorage jar showing Achilles killing the Amazon queen, Penthesilea. c. 530 BC.\nHow does Achilles die?\n\nAchilles is killed by an arrow, shot by the Trojan prince Paris. In most versions of the story, the god Apollo is said to have guided the arrow into his vulnerable spot, his heel. In one version of the myth Achilles is scaling the walls of Troy and about to sack the city when he is shot. In other accounts he is marrying the Trojan princess Polyxena and supposedly negotiating an end to the war when Paris fires the shot that kills him.\nEngraved cornelian scarab depicting wounded Achilles.

The Odyssey describes a huge tomb of Achilles on the beach at Troy, and Odysseus meets Achilles during his visit to the underworld, among a group of dead heroes.\nHow has Achilles been reinterpreted throughout history?\nThe complexity of Achilles\u2019 character has meant that he has been reinterpreted and reinvented throughout history.\nFor the ancient Greeks he was an archetypal hero who embodied the human condition. Despite his greatness he was still mortal and fated to die. A hero cult for Achilles developed in several areas across Greece where he was venerated and worshipped like a god. A structure known as the \u2018Tomb of Achilles\u2019 in the area where the city of Troy once stood became a place of pilgrimage for many in antiquity, including Alexander the Great.\n\nSimon Fran\u00e7ois Ravenet I (1706\u20131774), after Filippo Lauri, Alexander Visiting the Tomb of Achilles. Etching and engraving, 1769.\nFor the Romans, Achilles was on the one hand a model of military prowess but also, for poets such as Horace and Catullus, an archetype of brutality. By the medieval period, Achilles provided a model of how not to behave. Changes to the narrative in the markedly pro-Trojan versions of the myth that were dominant at this time made Achilles into a cowardly scoundrel who destroyed himself through his lustful passions. In Dante\u2019s Inferno, Achilles appears in the second circle of hell, that of lust.\nFilippo Albacini (1777\u20131858), The Wounded Achilles. Marble, 1825. \u00a9 The Devonshire Collections, Chatsworth. Reproduced by permission of Chatsworth Settlement Trustees.\nIn the Renaissance, when there was a renewal of interest in the classical world accompanying the reintroduction of Greek texts into western Europe, Achilles regained interest as a more complex character. By the early 19th century, the period of Romanticism, he was the perfect hero, embodying a life given over to emotion, and beauty doomed to ruin. A neoclassical sculpture of the period, The Wounded Achilles, shows the perfection of his body even in his dying moments. Achilles has also served as a heroic justification for the sacrifice of soldiers as well as a symbol of the destruction and brutality of war.\nMax Slevogt (1868\u20131932),\u00a0Achilles Frightens the Trojans. Print, 1905.\nAchilles\u2019 complex character continues to be explored.

The Orientalist art movement reached its height during the 19th century and is perhaps best known today for its production of impressive oil paintings and works on paper. These paintings were popular in the 19th century, as Europeans and North Americans increasingly turned their attentions to cultures overseas. The works were mostly by male Western artists, made to satisfy an enormous public interest in the lands of the Middle East and North Africa.\nMany artists travelled to the places they depicted, whether Constantinople, Jerusalem, Cairo or Marrakesh. Others travelled no further than Paris or Vienna, using a mixture of photographs, props and imagination for inspiration. Recurring images included everything from detailed sketches of everyday life to highly imaginative scenes of the harem. Interest in Orientalism developed in tandem with European colonial activity, which allowed soldiers, traders and artists greater access to the places and peoples of these regions.\nRead more about the origins of Orientalism in our blog.\nFaraway places\nAn important function of Orientalist painting was to create a visual record of places of interest. Such images were aimed at a growing market of Europeans and North Americans who either visited the Middle East and North Africa or were interested in the regions from afar. Travel was made easier by steamships and trains, so paintings tended to focus on cities, such as Constantinople, Cairo and Marrakesh, the arrival points for artists and their potential customers alike. Some images depicted sites of religious importance, both Christian and Muslim, while others captured the ancient sites of pre-Islamic history, such as the Egyptian pyramids.\nGrand Pyramid de Gyzeh (The Great Pyramid of Giza), Charles Th\u00e9odore Fr\u00e8re (1814\u20131888). Oil on panel. \u00a9\u00a0 Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia\nA picture in every street\nScenes of everyday life, whether realistic or imagined, were a particular source of interest to the Orientalist painters. Some images focused on a single individual, while others engaged with a multitude. Similarly, they ranged from quiet and contemplative pictures to wildly dramatic scenes. The most detailed were perhaps drawn from life, or betrayed the influence of photography \u2013 a newly emerging discipline. Others were clearly the products of a studio setting, where objects and clothes from different periods and places were liberally mixed as props.\nThe Dice Players, Rudolph Weisse (b.1869). Oil on panel. \u00a9\u00a0Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia\nPicturing faith\nImages of Muslims engaging with their faith, whether at prayer, performing the Hajj pilgrimage (as the image below shows) or studying in a madrasa (religious school), were an essential feature of the Orientalist vision. For Europeans and North Americans, religion was one of the key differences between themselves and the peoples of the Middle East and North Africa. Pictures such as these could therefore simply be seen as evoking an exotic \u2018Orient\u2019. Such depictions of religion can also be seen as a response to the anxieties of the time. European society and morality were in a state of flux \u2013 under pressure from industrialisation and secularism.\nThe Hajj, Alfred Dehodencq (1822\u20131882). Oil on canvas. \u00a9\u00a0Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia\nSeeing people\nDuring the 19th century, European and North American artists differed on how best to represent the various peoples of the world. Orientalist painters, who closely studied the different ethnic, religious and social groups of the Middle East and North Africa often focused on clothing. This was a continuation of the \u2018costume book\u2019 tradition of earlier centuries, as well as a response to the fashionable new practices of photography and ethnography (the study of people and cultures). Visitors to the Middle East and North Africa were often depicted in local dress, whether as a genuine attempt at cross-cultural existence or simply to experience the \u2018unusual\u2019 and different.\nEnglish artist John Frederick Lewis depicts himself in generic Middle Eastern dress, in Portrait of a Memlook Bey (1863) including this sash, which is displayed alongside the portrait in the exhibition. \u00a9\u00a0Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia\nA hidden world\nPerhaps the most controversial aspect of Orientalist painting is the recurring image of the woman within the harem, which privileges the male gaze of the outsider. Although the harem was merely a private domestic space to which unfamiliar men would not be admitted, Europeans and North Americans were fascinated by what happened within. Most artists resorted to their imaginations, using the backdrop of the harem as an excuse to paint nude women. This invasive attention was, in many ways, a metaphor for the Orientalist approach to the region.\nInterior of part of the harem of the Grand Seigneur, Antoine-Ignace Melling (1763\u20131831),\netching on paper, 1819. \u00a9\u00a0Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThis is a largely imagined interior of an Ottoman harem.

She reclaims Melling\u2019s depiction of a harem, turning his masculine and pseudo-realistic view into a living, breathing space. Opening with the 19th-century work, Eviner slowly replaces Melling\u2019s imagined characters with real ones of her own \u2013 active women who are protesting, praying and attempting to escape. Eviner explains: \u2018The figures shaped within the Orientalist fantasies of the age became part of a distinctly scientific description\u2026 this is why I was drawn into this hex; I wanted to tear this scene apart and get into it\u2019.\nInspired by the east: how the Islamic world influenced western art\u00a0is open\u00a0from 10 October 2019 \u2013 26 January 2020.\u00a0Find out more and book tickets.\nSupported by Jack Ryan\nSponsored by Standard Chartered Bank\nOrganised with the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-british-museum-membercast-rethinking-rembrandt/", "category": "Podcasts", "title": "The British Museum Membercast: Rethinking Rembrandt", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2019-09-20 00:00:00", "text": "The British Museum Membercast is a monthly podcast made available to \u2018all studious and curious persons\u2019.

His family was of modest means and he began work as a clerk with the East India Company at age 14. Due to his diligence as well as special patronage, he was promoted and sent to Southeast Asia in 1805.\nIn March 1816, Raffles sailed away from the island of Java where he had been Lieutenant-Governor for nearly five years. Among his substantial luggage containing administrative papers and correspondence, bottles of alcohol, raw materials, Japanese objects, gold, furniture and other private possessions were numerous Javanese objects. These included almost 450 puppets, over 700 coins, more than 350 drawings, over 130 masks, more than 120 small metal sculptures and five small stone sculptures. Once in Britain, Raffles\u2019 collections became a centre of attention as little was known about Java in Europe at the time. Raffles settled down to the task of writing his two-volume work, The History of Java, which was published in 1817.\nPortrait of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, James Thompson (1788\u20131850). Britain, 1824. Etching on paper.\nAs a result of Raffles\u2019 collections as well as his social and scholarly efforts, he was invited to join the Royal Society, the leading body of scholarly investigation in early 19th-century Britain. Raffles also became friendly with the royal family, particularly Princess Charlotte, the only child of the Prince Regent, the future King George IV. After dedicating his History of Java to the Prince Regent, Raffles was rewarded with a knighthood in May 1817.\nPart of Raffles\u2019 purpose in cultivating the royal family was to gather support for his ideas. His main belief was the importance of establishing a British free-trade port in Southeast Asia to facilitate connections between Britain\u2019s Indian colonies and its trade interests in China. Java\u2019s location was ideal, and Raffles was strongly in favour of Britain keeping the island as a colony. After the British returned Java to the Dutch at the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Raffles looked for a new site. He eventually took advantage of a succession dispute to establish Singapore as a British port in 1819. It is for this that he is primarily \u2013 and controversially \u2013 remembered today in Britain.\nIf we rewind to 1817, with the establishment of Singapore yet to come, Raffles was departing Britain to be Lieutenant-Governor of Bengkulu (Bencoolen), in southwest Sumatra. He left his Javanese collections behind with friends and family in London, but took many of his papers and letters from Java with him. Once established on Sumatra, Raffles studied the local cultures and collected natural history specimens and drawings, information about the region, and cultural materials. Tragically, all these things sank with Raffles\u2019 ship on his homeward voyage in 1824. There was no loss of life, but everything else went down. All of Raffles\u2019 administrative and collecting work was lost, including numerous irreplaceable Malay manuscripts, some dating from the 1400s. There were also more than 2,000 natural history drawings, live animals, including a tiger, and large amounts of information about the islands of Singapore, Borneo, and Sulawesi (then called Celebes). He had planned to write a history for each of these places. The destruction of all this material ended Raffles\u2019 development as an expert on Southeast Asia. He arrived in Britain with few objects to attract the attention of London society again (although he did co-found London Zoo). The loss of his papers also means that nobody knows where or how he acquired his collections, including the ones from Java. The British Museum is currently studying the surviving Javanese objects stylistically to determine where on the island they originated.\nThe main Javanese collections are a curious group, consisting of two quite different types of materials. On the one side, there are drawings of ancient Hindu-Buddhist stone monuments and stone sculpture, numerous small metal sculptures, and a few small stone sculptures from the early historic period (6th\u201315th centuries). On the other are theatrical items from 18th to early 19th-century Java. In his History of Java, Raffles discussed topics ranging from geography, botany, agriculture and commerce, to customs associated with major life events, dress, history, antiquities, literature, language and theatre. However, his collections clearly do not reflect this range of Javanese activities. This may partially be due to the fact that the study of human cultures had not yet developed (anthropology emerged later in the 19th century). It also suggests that Raffles\u2019 collections were not gathered to represent Javanese culture generally. Instead, the indications are that he amassed specific materials for a particular purpose: to demonstrate that the Javanese were an advanced civilisation (in his opinion) and to chart the historical progression of the island.\nThe group of drawings depicting ancient Hindu-Buddhist sites and the accompanying stone sculpture on Java are easily explained. Europeans at the time were fascinated with the historic monuments they encountered in Asia and the Hindu and Buddhist religions.\nArchitectural details of the temples labelled Nunkulo (Srikandi) and Sed\u00e9wo (Puntadewa) on the Dieng Plateau. G. P. Baker (786\u20131850), 1815, ink and wash on paper.\nThey also wanted to understand the histories of the various cultures. In part, a chronology of royalty helped the Europeans fit Asian cultures into the hierarchy of civilisations that they had developed. In their opinion, European society was the most civilised, and they judged other societies based on European criteria. These included the presence of writing, stone monuments, a progressive, European-style form of government, commerce, and an interest in history. Additionally, European society was experiencing a craze for \u2018the Picturesque\u2019 imagery depicting deserted and ruined buildings covered in vegetation. The ancient ruins of Java revealed an \u2018advanced\u2019 civilisation by European standards and at the same time satisfied contemporary European aesthetic ideals. Raffles commissioned sites to be cleared of vegetation, surveyed, and illustrated, and he also acquired drawings and plans from Dutch surveyors who had been on the island prior to the British invasion.\nPair of drawings showing a temple covered in foliage (right), and as imagined in a complete state (left), with commentary by G. P. Baker. H. C. Cornelius (1774\u2013c.1833), around 1807, ink and wash on paper.\nAs can be seen from the examples here, some of the drawings are plans and details, but others are images that the artists adapted to appeal to European taste. The pair of drawings depict a temple in its ruined state and what the artist thought it looked like when new. Not everybody agreed with these changes. G P Baker, who worked for Raffles, was particularly critical and annotated a number of the drawings. The comment on this pair reads \u2018Pure imagination or invention,\u2019 which is correct: they do not accurately represent the building. Despite the inaccuracies, Raffles included similar images in his History of Java.\nMore than 120 small metal and stone sculptures collected by Raffles also date to the Hindu-Buddhist phase of Javanese history. Most are Buddhist, like the image of the bodhisattva Vajrapani shown here.\nStatue of the Bodhisattva Vajrapani, AD 800s, bronze.\nBodhisattvas are enlightened beings who help others to advance spiritually. However, Raffles claimed that he had a complete set of Hindu gods, indicating how little Europeans knew of Asian religions at the time. The statement also shows that he wanted to develop comprehensive collections. While people collected natural history objects in systematic groups in the early 19th century, Raffles was one of the first to apply this method to cultural materials.\nThe practicalities of collecting also affected what Raffles acquired. Both the metal and stone sculptures are small and relatively light, as, of course, are the drawings. Collection development only became part of colonial policy in Asia later in the 19th century, so Raffles funded the transportation of his collections himself. Consequently, he acquired objects that could be moved with relative ease for his personal collection. The stone and metal sculptures were small and easily shipped, and Raffles commissioned drawings of the heavy and immovable objects. Thus, we can see that Raffles collected objects from early Java because they satisfied European ideals and beliefs \u2013 and were easy to move.\nLet\u2019s return to the other half of Raffles\u2019 collection, which consists of theatrical objects. These include masks, gamelan orchestral instruments, and three types of puppets \u2013 flat shadow puppets made of animal hide, flat wooden puppets, and three-dimensional wooden puppets. All the theatrical items are beautifully carved, painted, and decorated with gold leaf. Because of their high quality, the assumption has been that Raffles\u2019 collections came from the infamous British sack of the court of Yogyakarta, which occurred on his orders in June 1812. We have found that this is not the case for most of his collections. For example, we now know that the masks were new when Raffles acquired them because they are unused. He probably purchased them or received them as presents.\nMask of the character Kyai Manila, late 1700s- early 1800s, wood, pigment, gold leaf.\nGift-giving was a common part of diplomatic and political exchanges at the time, and Raffles regularly interacted with the courts at Cirebon, Madura, and Surakarta (now Solo). Having recently collaborated with Javanese academics, it is now possible to say that the styles of the puppets and musical instruments Rev William Charles Raffles Flintmeans they are probably from these courts, rather than Yogyakarta. Therefore many of his theatrical items were most likely gifts, purchases, or commissions.\nPuppet of the character Menak Jingga, the main villain in the Damarwulan narratives.\nWood, fibre, pigment, gold leaf, late 1700s or early 1800s\nThe theatrical objects are relatively portable, but the flat wooden puppets and three-dimensional puppets have had their support rods cut off, probably to ease transportation. The large numbers of masks, puppets and instruments show that Raffles also collected these objects in sets. However, the groups of puppets are not complete in Javanese terms. For example, there are few main characters and many demons, and as a result, a puppeteer could only present a few episodes from the long epic tales performed in Javanese theatre. It is evident that Raffles did not understand the roles of the various puppets in presenting Javanese narratives.\nA demon, Buta Kimul, Cirebon, Western Java, late 1700s-early 1800s, hide, horn, pigment, fibre, gold leaf.\nBut, the question remains as to why Raffles bothered to acquire theatrical materials at all. Such objects were not commonly part of European collecting in the early 19th century. Because of the gold leaf on the objects and the fact that performances were often held at court, Raffles associated the theatre with the Javanese upper classes, but he also noted that commoners happily watched the plays all night (performances lasted through the night). He also connected it with national history, writing in his book that the different types of theatre represented different phases of Javanese history. All these features confirmed Raffles in his belief that the Javanese were \u2018relatively civilised\u2019, as an interest in national history was an important marker of civilisation to Europeans. To him, it meant that the British should colonise the island permanently in order to assist the Javanese to improve themselves. These were typical ideas in early 19th-century Europe and provided the rationale for colonisation and exploitation in many instances. Thus, the two halves of the collections \u2013 Hindu-Buddhist material and theatrical objects \u2013 clearly were not separate in Raffles\u2019 mind as they provided a continuum from an early period of Javanese history to a later one.\nThe majority of Raffles\u2019 collections came to the British Museum in 1859, when they were donated by his nephew, Rev William Charles Raffles Flint, and the remainder arrived in 1939 from Raffles\u2019 great-grandniece, Mrs J H Drake. The objects provide intriguing insights into early 19th-century Britain and the ideas circulating there, but more vitally, they preserve a record of Javanese art and court culture before and during Raffles\u2019 politically notorious governorship.\nSir Stamford Raffles: collecting in Southeast Asia 1811-1824 is\u00a0open\u00a0in Room 91 until 12 January 2020.\nExhibition supported by the Singapore High Commission."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-british-museum-membercast-the-power-of-manga/", "category": "Podcasts", "title": "The British Museum Membercast: The power of manga", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2019-08-27 00:00:00", "text": "The British Museum Membercast is a monthly podcast made available to \u2018all studious and curious persons\u2019.

By the time the team came back down to earth, the Museum gates were open. That was when the visitor made their remark, as they stopped in the forecourt to photograph the flag flying from the Museum\u2019s famous facade. It was an amazing way to start the day.\nWhen the rainbow flag first flew above the British Museum in 2017, Laura Phillips, then the Museum\u2019s Head of Community Partnerships, stated that it flew as a sign of inclusivity for all the \u2018unrecorded lives, the unwritten conversations, the unspoken romances\u2019. This year the Museum will take this idea one step further and start to share some of those stories as it launches volunteer-led LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer) tours which will uncover non-heteronormative and non-binary stories within the Museum\u2019s rich collection.

The tours will give a greater sense of identity and ownership to LGBTQ+ visitors and remind them that they are accepted, welcome and celebrated. Over the years I have received much advice and support from team members at the British Museum. Through conversations with them, my belief that LGBTQ+ people belong in museums and cultural spaces has been bolstered. Our stories exist across place, time and culture. It\u2019s time to tell them.\nQueer stories are embedded within the collection of every major UK museum and gallery, but the uniquely vast and comprehensive collection at the British Museum offers the opportunity to find a staggering number of fascinating LGBTQ stories. The new LGBTQ tours at the Museum will explore gender and sexual identities through a wide selection of objects.\nTo give a sense of the range of cultures and time periods covered, one of the volunteer LGBTQ tour guides gave me an impressive list of objects for his first tour. It includes the ancient Roman sculpture of the Discobolus, an almost 4,000-year-old Babylonian depiction of the Queen of the Night, a stele erected for Hor and Suty \u2013 two high government officials in ancient Egypt, as well the glorious \u2018holy grail of homosexuality\u2019, the Warren Cup \u2013 a Roman drinking cup, decorated with explicit images of male lovers.\nAs Ruth Hunt, CEO of LGBT rights charity Stonewall put it: \u2018The Warren Cup speaks to the universality of LGBT people.

The impact of the Museum showing a commitment to our LGBTQ+ community cannot be underestimated \u2013 it is both meaningful and inspiring \u2013 and it shows just how important visibility is.\nMuseum staff attend Pride in London. \u00a9 Dan Vo.\nThe Museum\u2019s involvement in LGBTQ history is not restricted to the collection \u2013 on the morning I watched the rainbow flag being raised, we gathered in the stately boardroom under the watchful eyes of former directors, whose portraits hang on the room\u2019s four walls. I took special note of Lord Wolfenden who, in addition to being Director of the Museum, was chairman of the Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution. It was this committee\u2019s famous report that helped pave the way for the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality in England and Wales in 1967.\nThis might not have happened, though, had it not been for Carl Winter who was then Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge (and was once Deputy Keeper of the V&A). Winter demanded to be seen by the committee and when granted an audience, he became \u2013 in an astounding act of bravery \u2013 one of only three men who identified as homosexual to testify. His arguments were fundamental in changing the hearts and minds of those on the panel.\nMichael Noakes (1933\u20132018), portrait of Sir John (later Lord) Wolfenden. Oil painting, 1974.\nWolfenden and Winter provide a special link between the LGBTQ tours at the British Museum, V&A and Fitzwilliam Museum. In our collective efforts to promote equality, diversity, inclusion and representation in our institutions, we are honouring and carrying on the great work of those who have come before us. This legacy is in good hands. I\u2019ve had the privilege of being one of the people involved in training British Museum volunteer guides and know how committed they are to representing a broad spectrum of identities and cultures through the tours. It is wonderful that major cultural institutions are recognising, supporting and celebrating LGBTQ+ people \u2013 and it is the Museum\u2019s passionate team of volunteers who are helping them to realise this attitude.\nEven in the early hours of that Thursday morning in early July, there was a joyous energy rippling through the team \u2013 one that was anchored by understanding of the challenges that have been overcome to reach this point and the significance of having the rainbow flag fly above the Museum. Former Assistant Collections Manager George Benson has already written about the importance of the flag so eloquently that I feel I should leave the last word to him:\n\u2018Just by seeing the flag and the Museum together, even just for a weekend, can have an enormously supportive effect on anyone, LBGTQ or straight, because it\u2019s about society accepting who you are and accepting who you love.\u2019\nFree British Museum LGBTQ tours run on select dates throughout the year.

One of the things I always bear in mind when speaking about this remarkable artist is that the scope of his work goes far beyond what can be summarised in an hour, even at breakneck speed. Another is that his story is, quite literally, as exciting, inspiring and sometimes hair-raising as any manga he ever wrote. From his tranquil middle-class childhood in a small town deep in the countryside near Osaka, through school bullying and first-hand experience of Japan\u2019s increasing militarism, to post-war success as a teenage superstar and the endless battle to stay on top of the booming anime and manga markets he helped to shape. Tezuka\u2019s life combined solid artistic achievement across a number of fields with self-curated celebrity.\nOne of Tezuka\u2019s most important roles in the history of manga \u2013 and in the revival of Japan\u2019s media industry after it practically shutdown during the war \u2013 was acting as a bridge between the cosmopolitan, wide-ranging manga of the 1920s and early 1930s and its post-war revival. Many manga artists, writers and editors perished alongside their readers in the fire-bombings of Tokyo and on the Pacific front. The few survivors carried forward the memory of pre-war manga as open and trans-cultural, as part of a wider engagement with film, politics, music and art.\nTezuka Osamu at work. \u00a9 Tezuka Productions\nThe skinny, bespectacled teenager from Osaka led the way. Fuelled by his youthful passion for Japanese, European and American comics, films and animation, and his determination to keep on creating comics in spite of the deprivations and dangers of wartime, Tezuka embraced Japan\u2019s surrender as a chance to live his life to the full and help to create a new, peaceful world. At 17 he signed up for medical school and sold his first professional work within a few months of the end of hostilities. He also began to build relationships with other Japanese comic creators and editors, keeping a keen eye out for newcomers, both to offer help and encouragement, and to keep his finger on the pulse of new ideas and trends. He knew that young readers like himself wanted more than four-panel gag strips. They wanted stories that would help them to escape the poverty of post-war Japan and to imagine new and better worlds.\nIn Tezuka\u2019s first long-form work, the ground-breaking Shintakarajima (New Treasure Island,1947) \u00a0we can see the influence of film at work. He picked up his passion for film not only from his father, an early tech adopter who held home film shows for his family and neighbours before the war, but from earlier manga creators who were also influenced by new media. He knew Okamoto Ippei\u2019s work from childhood, alongside that of Kitazawa Rakuten, the father of modern manga, who taught cartooning to Oten Shimokawa, creator of Japan\u2019s first publicly screened animated film. Tezuka saw in Okamoto a deep Buddhist spirituality, but Okamoto was also engaged with film media to the extent that \u00a0he called one of his works eiga shosetsu. Translating as \u2018cinema novel\u2019, it was a hybrid of conventional story and manga frames drawn as film frames, complete with sprocket holes, like on a reel of film.\nIn impoverished post-war Japan, manga was a cheap, accessible form of entertainment that could be widely shared around or swapped, and re-read as often as required. Tezuka\u2019s new long-form stories, with plot twists and character development galore, conveyed the visual excitement of cinema. They were popular with boys and girls alike, and he built up a broad fan base for his science fiction, his tales of adventure and his lush romantic dramas. In the 1950s Tezuka debuted two characters who would sum up these two poles of his universe.\nAtomu Taishi (Ambassador Atom), Tezuka Osamu \u00a9Tezuka Productions\nAtom, a childlike robot, was a supporting character in Atom Taishi (Ambassador Atom, 1951.) A year later, Atom became the leading character in the highly influencial Tetsuwan Atom (Iron-Arm Atom, known in English as Astro Boy.) Atom\u2019s appeal spread beyond the comic book page to a live action TV series, radio drama, merchandising, education, public service information, and Japan\u2019s first animated sequential TV drama. Six months after his Japanese animated debut on New Years Day 1963, Atom\u2019s adventures were shown on TV in the USA. Today, 65 years on, Tezuka\u2019s robot creation has become a symbol for the oppressed, having been sold into slavery, rejected and unjustly imprisoned. He has been an advocate for peace, speaking out against war in many stories and taking direct action to protect Vietnamese villagers during a story set in the Vietnam war. He has also inspired real-life scientific and robotic developments and cross-cultural homages in comics, art and on the stage.\nA Honda ASIMO robot conducting an orchestra \u2013 one of the robotic developments inspired by Astro Boy.\n\u00a9 Vanillase [CC BY-SA 3.0]\nIf we were to look for a contemporary Western equivalent, we would have to cite something with the wide-ranging cultural impact of Star Trek.\nIn another of his seminal works, Sapphire, a beautiful and accomplished princess born with two hearts, one male and one female, must play the role of a prince to protect her country and her family. She made her first appearance in 1953 in Ribon no kishi (Knight of the Ribbon, known in English as Princess Knight.) This ground-breaking manga was hugely influential on girls\u2019 comic artists across Japan and beyond, establishing a tradition of heroines with androgynous characteristics and a 19th-century European aesthetic.\nThis portrayal of a-typical women was doubtless influenced by the wartime experience of seeing his mother and the women of his community put away their pretty clothes and makeup, put on work trousers or uniforms, and step into essential roles left vacant by men sent to the front. But Princess Knight is above all a loving homage to Tezuka\u2019s beloved Takarazuka Revue. Founded in his hometown in 1913, this unique musical theatre troupe was a favourite entertainment of his mother, who would often take him along. Several performers were near neighbours, so Tezuka became accustomed to seeing one familiar person play many exotic roles. In a reversal of Japan\u2019s classical theatre tradition, which excludes women, Takarazuka has only female players.\nSapphire\u2019s dual male and female personalities \u2013 and the lush settings of the manga and its romantic storylines \u2013 reflect Tezuka\u2019s childhood experience of Takarazuka and the threat of invasion from an unknown beyond.\nPrincess Knight, Tezuka Osamu \u00a9Tezuka Productions\nLooking at this example of cover art, we see a heroic boy/girl in an absurdly feminine hat \u2013 not even the Three Musketeers used ribbons that size! Standing en garde at the foot of a majestic marble staircase, they defend their beloved mother unassisted, except for a chirpy little boy. Dark, twisted trees form a proscenium arch hint at an encroaching threat. It\u2019s both an imaginative essay in theatrical romanticism, and a potent encapsulation of a nation at bay with only women and children left to defend its fragile beauty.\nTezuka continued to develop these two characters as leading players in his personal repertory company, but they were far from alone onstage. Mining his childhood for characters, he created a group of archetypes and used them like actors in his ongoing works. He added in new players, including characters from mythology and history \u2013 Mnemosyne, the mother of the Muses, in Barbara, Ludwig van Beethoven in Ludwig B, Hitler in Adolf \u2013 and animals, including the heroic young lion of his 1950 manga and 1965 cartoon series Jungle Taitei/Jungle Emperor. This was broadcast in the USA as Kimba the White Lion, and inspired controversy in 1994 because of Disney\u2019s insistence that, despite well documented similarities, Kimba was unknown to their staff and had no influence on their movie The Lion King.\nTezuka\u2019s death in 1989, soon after that of the Showa Emperor, was unexpected. His illness was kept secret from everyone except family and close friends, and his legions of fans were devastated. Foreign journalists arriving in Tokyo to cover the Imperial funeral were surprised to find such public attention focused on the funeral of a comic book artist. His cortege passed between lines of weeping fans, grandparents who had been children when he made his debut in 1946 carrying grandchildren clutching toys based on his works. Tezuka\u2019s interpreter and friend Frederik L. Schodt compared Japanese reactions to his death to the despair following John Lennon\u2019s murder in 1981.\nIn recent years Tezuka\u2019s works, and works about him, have been widely translated. In English, my own book The Art of Osamu Tezuka: God of Manga has been augmented by a superb translation of Toshio Ban\u2019s manga biography of Tezuka, available in English from Stone Bridge Press as The Osamu Tezuka Story. I hope you will enjoy exploring this fascinating creator\u2019s life and work further!\nYou can purchase The Art of Osamu Tezuka: God of Manga here.\nThe Citi exhibition\u00a0Manga\u00a0is open until 26 August 2019.\n\nSupported by Citi\nLogistics partner IAG Cargo"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/collecting-histories/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Collecting histories", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2019-08-02 00:00:00", "text": "The British Museum was founded in 1753 and the collection has grown exponentially over time. The way the Museum collects today is incredibly varied \u2013 objects sometimes enter the collection directly, in other instances they have passed through different owners, sometimes over a long period of time, before finally coming to the Museum.\nThere are many ways in which objects have been collected in the past. For objects acquired in earlier centuries, catalogue records produced at the time do not always explain fully how the item left the place where it was made and used or outline all the stages of its journey to British Museum. Museum curators are currently actively researching different parts of the collection to address gaps in the record, particularly where collecting histories need to be better understood, so that they can be acknowledged and debated.\nThe current Asahi Shimbun Displays Collecting histories: Solomon Islands in Room 3 is part of this wider initiative. A key part of this display explores how colonial collecting histories can be more effectively acknowledged and interpreted in future exhibitions and projects. The Solomon Islands display focuses on some of the different ways in which objects left the Pacific and came to be in the Museum\u2019s collection. To explore these themes further you can also can follow a related trail through some of the Museum\u2019s permanent galleries. The trail highlights 15 objects from Africa, Asia, North America and Oceania that were largely acquired during the colonial era, with the trail focusing on objects made during the last 300 years. It acknowledges and highlights the varied ways in which objects like these then became part of the British Museum\u2019s collection.\nCollecting histories\nFrom around 1500 to the mid-20th century, a number of European countries established competing overseas empires. Britain\u2019s empire expanded overtime to become the largest, bringing great benefits to Britain, often at the expense of the colonies, and leaving a complex and contested global legacy. Many of the objects and artefacts that are now in the Museum\u2019s collection were acquired during the colonial era \u2013 the period when Britain had an overseas empire. Objects were acquired through trade, exchange and purchase, but also through the activity of Christian missions and during the imposition of colonial control by armed forces when cultural artefacts were sometimes taken as spoils of war. These types of acquisitions \u2013 where objects have been taken by force, and not freely given or fairly purchased \u2013 are rightly the focus of increasing debate today.\nHere we explore the stories of six objects included in the trail that highlight the intimate relationship between colonialism and the Museum\u2019s collections and collecting history.\nMask, Java\nThe stylistic features and unused condition of this mask indicate that it was probably a gift or was purchased by Raffles, rather than being taken forcibly or acquired through looting.\nThis Javanese mask was collected by Sir Stamford Raffles (1781\u20131826), a British colonial official. Raffles was\u00a0Lieutenant-Governor of Java and became infamous for authorising an attack on the most powerful Javanese court. During his time there, he amassed collections and compiled reports on aspects of the island that appealed to early 19th-century European ideas about what constituted a civilised culture. He was particularly interested in national history and antiquities. Raffles\u2019 collecting seems to have been motivated by a desire to persuade British politicians that Java should be retained as a colony.\u00a0Stylistic features and the unused condition of the mask indicate that it was probably a gift or was purchased by Raffles, rather than being taken forcibly or acquired through looting. However, all of Raffles\u2019 papers were lost when the ship returning him to Britain in 1824 sank, so we will never know for certain how his objects were obtained. Raffles\u2019 collection was donated to the British Museum in 1859 upon the death of his widow.\nThe British in Java\nFrance acquired the island of Java when it defeated the Dutch in 1807 during the Napoleonic wars, gaining access to Southeast Asian resources, a situation intolerable to the British. After a military expedition by East India Company troops in 1811, Raffles was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Java. He held the position until the island was returned to the Dutch in 1816. Raffles thought Britain should retain Java as a colony because he felt Southeast Asia was of particular strategic importance since it connected British colonies in India with its trade interests in China. He wished to establish a centre through which goods such as ceramics, textiles, tea, coffee, spices and opium could be freely traded to benefit the British. Unable to develop Java, Raffles established Singapore as a British port in 1819.\nAncestral screen, Nigeria\nCarved wooden funerary screen from 19th century, showing a house-head in the masquerade outfit that he performed in life. This one is Bekinarusibi (\u2018white man\u2019s ship on head\u2019) and celebrates the wealth that came from trade with Europeans.\nThe background to the acquisition of this screen provides a fascinating insight into the daily business of the colonial government in Nigeria in early 20th-century West Africa.\nAt the request of Kalabari chiefs in 1916, a number of ancestral screens were placed under the protection of P Amaury Talbot, a British district officer in southern Nigeria. This unusual appeal came in response to a period of religious persecution that swept the New Calabar towns of Bakana and Abonema in southeastern Nigeria in 1915\u20131916. This movement, initiated by Garrick Braide, the fundamentalist Christian leader and self-styled \u2018prophet\u2019, threatened the widespread destruction of Kalabari ancestral shrines.\nTalbot presented nine of these screens to the British Museum and a further two to the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford. Today, ancestral shrines are still commissioned and honoured by Kalabari people.\nTrade and politics in the Niger Delta\nFor several centuries the Kalabari people of the eastern Niger Delta (now Cross River State in southeastern Nigeria) acted as middlemen, importing European goods into the African interior and exporting African produce to the West. They became active intermediaries in the slave trade when the area became a centre for trade between Europeans on the coast and Africans further inland, in return receiving European brassware, alcohol and firearms. The heads of these trading houses accrued great wealth and exerted influence locally. Following the abolition of the slave trade, the Kalabari lost their position as independent traders. Britain implemented a policy of indirect rule in the region from the late 19th century, finally establishing an amalgamated Nigerian protectorate in 1914.\nAt the time when this screen was acquired there was increasing local frustration at the restrictive administrative policy of the colonial authorities. Kalabari economic activity had been usurped by British-imposed bureaucracy and traditional beliefs and practices were being destabilised by the activity of Christian mission churches. In this context Garrick Braide\u2019s fundamentalist movement generated enormous local support. The ancestral screens, with their images of conspicuous prosperity and independent Kalabari religious and social interests became vulnerable targets for populist religious movement, and some screens were destroyed as a result of Braide\u2019s ministry.\nPukara, 2013, Australia\nPukara, made by the Spinifex people, acrylic on canvas, 2013. The painting depicts two men from Pukara, father and son, represented as water serpents. Also present in the painting are the snake men, who are on their way to Mulaya.\nThis painting by senior men of the Spinifex people depicts important Ancestral Beings who created the landscape, people and law which they abide by. Before beginning to paint on canvas, Spinifex people made ephemeral paintings on the body and on the ground. A series of major paintings was created in the late 1990s demonstrating their customary law and helping to achieve recognition of native title.\nMen and women of the Spinifex people also paint their stories and country in a form suitable for sale to outsiders. Their art can now be bought at art galleries in Australia and around the world. This painting was created with the support of the community based Spinifex Arts Project, and purchased in 2013 by the British Museum from the Outstation Gallery in Darwin, Australia.\nBritish colonisation of Australia\nAustralia has been inhabited for at least 60,000 years. Although English explorer William Dampier visited the northwest coast of Australia in the late 1600s, and Captain James Cook sailed up the east coast in 1770, permanent British occupation first began in 1788 with a \u2018First Fleet\u2019 of convicts being sent from Britain to form the new colony of New South Wales. In 1901, Australia became a country independent from Great Britain.\nSome Aboriginal people in remote central Australia remained out of contact with Europeans until the early 1980s. The Spinifex people were moved off their ancestral lands when Britain used it for the testing of atomic weapons in the 1950s and 1960s. After a long struggle, their claim for recognition of rights to land was recognised by the Australian courts in 2000.\nAppliqu\u00e9d tunic (jibba), Sudan\n\nDervishes (literally, \u2018poor men\u2019), were religious men who wore ragged, patched outfits \u2013 muraqqa\u2019a. Their clothing was a clear indication of their rejection of material wealth and an embracing of religious life.\u00a0 The original tunic was replaced by this smarter outfit, the jibba.\n\nThis jibba, worn by a Sudanese soldier, formed part of the spoils of war taken by Anglo-Egyptian forces at the battle of Atbara, Sudan in 1898. Based on the pocket decoration it probably belonged to a senior army officer. After their victory at Atbara, Anglo-Egyptian troops raided the Sudanese enclosure and, following established practice for both sides of the conflict at this period, took clothing and personal items.\nMajor General Sir William Forbes Gatacre (1843\u20131906), who commanded the British Brigade at Atbara, appears to have taken this jibba to the UK. His widow, Lady Beatrix Gatacre, presented it to the Museum in 1909.\nAnglo-Egyptian involvement in Sudan\nIn 1819\u20131820 Mohamed Ali, the Ottoman ruler of Egypt, dispatched his army up the Nile to occupy northern and central Sudan. This period of occupation was brought to an end by a Sudanese nationalist movement led by Muhammed Ahmad (1844\u20131885), an Islamic religious leader and self-proclaimed Mahdi (\u2018rightly guided one\u2019). The movement\u2019s capture of Khartoum in January 1885 and the creation of the Mahdist state (1881\u20131898), led to Anglo-Egyptian involvement in Sudan and the birth of the present Republic of Sudan.\nMany followers of the Mahdi wore tunics (jibba), with appliqu\u00e9d patches of coloured cloth as a uniform. This form of tunic was probably inspired by the everyday garments worn by religious men in the region that were patched as they became ragged. The Mahdi introduced these tunics to unify and control the disparate ethnicities and regional allegiances of his followers to create cohesive military units.\nTotem pole, Haida, British Columbia, Canada\nThe photograph shows this Haida totem pole in front of the frame of a timber house, what was either the Goose or Bear House. From top to bottom the pole features crests of a chief holding a talking stick, a sea-grizzly (sea monster), a shaman holding two rattles made of puffin beaks, a large whale and a sea-grizzly between tail fins of a killer whale.\nThis pole was originally at the front of a clan house in the village of Kayang on Graham Island in British Columbia, Canda. It features crests \u2013 ancestral beings that mark identity and assign families with rights to stories and property. When Haida chief Wiah sold the House pole around 1900, the village of Kayang had been abandoned for nearly 15 years. The settlement had once been a productive community but was devastated by epidemics in the late 1800s and survivors relocated to the nearby village of Masset. When Wiah sold the pole to the British medical doctor and naturalist C F Newcombe, he recounted the stories associated with the depicted crests for him. The first story is associated with a raven disguised as a chief attempting to retrieve his beak, which he lost while stealing halibut from people\u2019s hooks. The second story refers to a son who atones for bad behaviour and evades criticisms from his shaman mother-in-law by calling a whale ashore and hiding inside its body. In 1903, Newcombe sold the pole to the British Museum.\nFirst Nations of British Columbia\nBy the 1780s, European explorers and settlers introduced diseases like smallpox and influenza to Pacific Northwest Coast peoples who had little immunity to them. Many of these illnesses attacked older people who were knowledgeable leaders. Their loss threatened the political stability of communities and the transmission of knowledge and languages. By the time British Columbia became Canada\u2019s sixth province in 1871, sickness, armed hostilities and starvation had reduced indigenous population numbers in British Columbia by more than half.\nBetel-nut cutter, Sri Lanka\nThis female-shaped cutter made of brass and iron was for preparing the narcotic betel-nut. Acquired by Hugh Nevill, it was likely made by the Kandyan Society of Arts he co-founded.\nThis betel-nut cutter was acquired by Hugh Nevill (1847\u20131897), a British colonial official in the Ceylon Civil Service. During the 30 years he spent living and working in Ceylon, Nevill amassed a large and wide-ranging collection. While he wrote extensively about natural history specimens and prepared a catalogue of his manuscripts, he left little information about the historic and contemporary objects he acquired. Nevill was one of the founding members of the Kandyan Society of Arts, which was set up to support the manufacture of traditional crafts by local artisans in Kandy. It is likely that most of the wood and metal-work in his collection, including this betel-nut cutter, was made by this Society. The Society still exists and is now called the Kandyan Art Association. The Museum purchased part of Nevill\u2019s collection following his death.\nThe British in Ceylon (Sri Lanka)\nSri Lanka has long been an integral part of Indian Ocean trade. An important trading hub and a rich source of natural resources, the island was invaded by both Indian and European powers. During the Napoleonic Wars (1799\u20131815), the British first occupied the coastal areas of Sri Lanka and, in 1815, took control of the rest of the island, including the Kingdom of Kandy. The Ceylon Civil Service , was established to administer this British Crown Colony. However, after decades of agitation, the island was granted independence from British colonial rule as the Dominion of Ceylon in 1948. In 1972, Ceylon became the Republic of Sri Lanka.\nTo find out more about the ways in which some objects from Africa, Asia, North America and Oceania became part of the Museum\u2019s collection, pick up a free Collecting histories trail leaflet from the Information Desk at the Museum.\nThe Asahi Shimbun Displays Collecting histories: Solomon Islands is open in Room 3 until 1 September 2019.\nSupported\u00a0by\u00a0The\u00a0Asahi\u00a0Shimbun."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/a-history-of-storytelling-through-pictures/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "A history of storytelling through pictures", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2019-07-24 00:00:00", "text": "African rock art\nRock art is the practice of engraving, drawing, or painting images onto immovable rock surfaces, and is one of the oldest material forms of human expression in the world, dating back 30,000 years in Africa.\nRock art researchers grapple with questions of what rock art means, what stories the images tell and how we can interpret and understand them.

Ashurnasirpal II (883\u2013859 BC) was the first Assyrian king to extensively decorate his palace with carved stone panels.\nRelief depicting the king hunting wild lions from his battle chariot.\nThe majority depict magical protective figures, such as winged genies, that protected the king from harmful supernatural forces. Some palace rooms were also decorated with narrative scenes. Major themes include the royal hunt, military campaigns and state rituals. The wall panels were painted in vibrant colours, but few traces of pigment survive today.\nRelief showing siege engines being used to attack an enemy city.\nThe narrative scenes depicted on Ashurnasirpal\u2019s palace sculptures convey the political and ideological basis of the Assyrian empire. As the divinely appointed protector of Assyria, it was the king\u2019s duty to maintain order in the world by defeating the forces of chaos. Ashurnasirpal shows his ability to protect the realm by slaying dangerous animals and defeating Assyria\u2019s enemies.\nRelief showing Ashurnasirpal charging into battle in his chariot. A winged deity fights beside him.\nThe wall panels are typically divided into registers, much like a modern cartoon strip, that can be read from left to right, or from right to left. Events that occurred at different moments in time are often depicted within the same narrative space so the viewer can follow each stage of the story in the right order.\n\nChinese bronze mirror\nIn China, narrative scenes featuring historical figures started to be used from the Han dynasty (202\u2013220 BC) for decoration on mirrors. With four groups of figures, this mirror tells the story of a decisive episode during the years of epic war between two powerful states in southeast China \u2013 Wu and Yue in the period between 770\u2013476 BC.\nThe figure on the left that seems to be in both deep grief and indignation (with his wide open eyes and mouth and flying beard) is Wu Zixu, a heroic general of the Wu state. He is shown holding a blade committing suicide and the reason why is revealed in the other three quarters of the mirror.\nDetail showing Wu Zixu committing suicide.\nAfter years of conflict, king of the Yue state and his minister (the two figures to the left of Wu Zixu) come up with an idea to compromise the Wu state, by sending beautiful women to the king of Wu. The beautiful Yue girls were accepted by the Wu king, who sits in his throne flanked and backed with finely decorated panels, while shaking his hands to decline Wu Zixu\u2019s advice to reject the Yue girls. As Wu Zixu protests, he was given a sword by the Wu king and ordered to commit suicide for offending his king.\n\nThe dreadful death of this loyal general also signals the inevitable fate of the Wu state. With its king and other offices being corrupted, the state was finally annexed by the Yue in 473 BC, just nine years after the death of Wu Zixu.\nCarved limestone panel from the Great Shrine of Amaravati\nAmong the most important works of ancient Buddhist literature are the stories of 550 previous lives of the Buddha, known as the j\u0101takas.\nIn these stories, the Buddha takes various forms such as selfless kings, dutiful sons and in some cases animals such as elephants, monkeys and goats. With parallels to the fables of Aesop, the j\u0101takas offered moral guidance to the masses, whilst illustrating Buddhist teachings in compelling and dramatic ways. The culmination of the j\u0101takas was the Buddha\u2019s final existence as Prince Siddhartha Gautama, which preceded his eventual enlightenment.\nOne example of the Buddha\u2019s final j\u0101taka is a carved limestone panel from the Great Shrine of Amaravati, which was one of the oldest, largest and most important Buddhist monuments in ancient India, founded around 200 BC in what is now the state of Andhra Pradesh in the south east of India.\nThe panel dates to the first century AD, when depictions of the Buddha remained \u2018aniconic\u2019 (not portrayable in human form). It presents a narrative of his conception and birth with scenes or \u2018cells\u2019 that can be read like a comic from upper-right to lower-left.\nDetail showing the Buddha\u2019s mother, Queen M\u0101y\u0101 dreaming of a white elephant, representing the Buddha\u2019s conception.\nThe first scene on the upper-right depicts the Buddha\u2019s mother, Queen M\u0101y\u0101, blissfully dreaming of a white elephant entering her side, representing the Buddha\u2019s conception. When hearing of this, the king demands the dream to be interpreted by the court sage, who predicts the child will grow up either to become a great emperor or a great spiritual leader. This can be seen in the cell on the upper-left.\nMoving chronologically to the lower-right, Prince Siddhartha; the Buddha to-be, is born immaculately from Queen M\u0101y\u0101\u2019s side as she holds the branch of a tree, in the presence of the four Dikp\u0101la (guardian figures) who each hold a cloth on which the tiny footprints can be seen \u2013 a subtle but clear aniconic depiction of the Buddha\u2019s first steps. (The tiny footprints of the Buddha are visible only when viewed very close up, so try and find them when you next visit the Museum.)\nScene showing the Buddha to-be, being born immaculately from Queen M\u0101y\u0101\u2019s side.\nIn the final scene on the lower-left, the cloth is presented by Queen M\u0101y\u0101 to a tutelary deity who pays tribute to it with the gesture of Anjali Mudra, his head bowed reverentially with palms pressed together in respect.\nCasket showing the Passion cycle\nThese four ivory panels once formed sides of a square box, probably made in Rome in the first half of the fifth century AD. A condensed story of seven separate events unfolded on its surface. Each plaque formed part of a Passion cycle, focused on the last days of Christ.\n\nThe four panels, which originally made up the casket, depicting scenes of the passion of Christ.\nThe narrative begins with Pilate washing his hands (top left) and culminates with Christ\u2019s appearance to the disciples after the Resurrection (bottom right). Jesus is the protagonist of every scene. On rotating the box, the setting would change almost like a film shot. Christ would first be seen carrying the cross, then hanging on it. After that, the tone of the narrative alters as compositions become simpler. We see women standing before Jesus\u2019s empty tomb and then apostles surrounding Jesus in the Incredulity of Thomas.\n\nPanel showing Jesus carrying the cross\nArtistic rendering allowed the story to be enriched with additional meanings. Placed at the opposite edges of the box, the images formed visual echoes and references \u2013 the actions of the disciple Thomas, ready to put his fingers into the wounds of Christ, replicate those of Longinus piercing the ribs of Jesus at the Crucifixion. In the latter scene, Christ is portrayed alive and with his eyes wide open, while the figure of Judas is hanging lifeless on a tree. The tree itself forms a visual parallel to the wooden bars of the represented cross. This attention to detail allows viewers even today to experience anew the well-known accounts of the Gospels.\nYaxchilan lintels\nThese relief sculptures, known as the Yaxchilan lintels, are from the ancient Maya site of Yaxchil\u00e1n in the south west of Mexico. The sculptures were placed above doorways that led into a single space in a court building. They tell a short story about Lady K\u2019abal Xook, who was a leader in the Maya community in the 7th\u20138th century AD.\nThe first lintel depicting Lady Xook in a blood letting ritual.\nThe first lintel shows Lady Xook pulling a studded rope through her tongue and her blood falling into a bark-paper lined bowl by her knees as part of a bloodletting ritual. Lady Xook\u2019s partner, Iztaamnaj B\u2019ahlam, stands nearby with a torch. Bloodletting was a common ritual among Maya elites to honour the gods. The glyphs (writing) carved into the image tell us that this scene took place in AD 709.\n\nThe second lintel depicting Lady Xook communicating with an ancestor.\nThe next lintel shows the result of burning the blood-soaked paper. A serpent grows from the smoke and Lady Xook communicates with an ancestor, perhaps as part of a vision. However, despite seeming to follow on from the story in the previous lintel carving, this vision is dated back in time, to AD 681. The last lintel shows Lady Xook handing her partner a jaguar helmet, symbolising his endorsed rulership. The scene dates to AD 724.\nTo a contemporary non-Maya audience, this sequence will seem unfamiliar. However, their play on time in this narrative is moving. The sequences reminds us of the power of a repeated gesture and the timelessness of important cultural stories. The artist who devised this narrative made the works with a sense of the role ancestors play in our experience of the present and our imagination of the future.\nBayeux Tapestry\nThe Bayeux Tapestry is one of the most instantly recognised masterpieces of medieval art and an important historical source for the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, but neither is a tapestry or (in all probability) was it made in Bayeux!\nIt is in fact embroidery work, constructed of different coloured woollen threads sewn onto eight strips of linen. It is uncertain where the Bayeux Tapestry was made, but it may have been commissioned by William of Normandy\u2019s half-brother, Bishop Odo of Bayeux, for the consecration of his cathedral in 1077. It was known to be in Bayeux in 1476, though forgotten from history until its rediscovery in the 1690s. Because of parallels with late Anglo-Saxon manuscripts from Canterbury, it is thought that the embroidery was made there.\nPart of the Bayeux Tapestry showing the battle field at Hastings.\nThe embroidery, if designed by Norman men, is likely to have been worked by Anglo-Saxon women. It tells the story of the Norman Conquest from about 1064 \u2013 when Harold goes on expedition to northern France, joining William on a military campaign against a rebellious Breton lord. It then depicts how Harold claims the crown himself in 1066, leading his army to a bloody defeat at the place now known as Battle. Although sometimes seen as a work of Norman propaganda, it is fairly impartial \u2013 perhaps reflecting a time when the Normans were hoping to integrate with their Anglo-Saxon foes.\nPlaster-cast from the Bayeux Tapestry showing three figures.\nThe cartoon-esque style of the Bayeux Tapestry resonates with the modern viewer. Although its depictions appear na\u00efve, it tells a lively and entertaining history \u2013 with sex scenes, blood and gore. No wonder it has been imitated by cartoonists in recent history, especially by political satirists. Near on 1,000 years old, it is as sharp today as it was then.\nThe Bayeux Tapestry is not in the British Museum collection but the Museum does have a series of casts of the embroidery. You can find out more about the Bayeux Tapestry here.\nJapanese handscrolls\nMany people are familiar with modern manga, but the art form \u2013 with its expressive lines and images \u2013 is much older than you might think. Manga\u2019s roots can be traced back almost a thousand years to painted Japanese handscrolls.\nThe Tale of the Monkeys\nAround the year AD 1200, a humorous, anonymous artist produced a set of painted handscrolls that show rabbits and monkeys bathing in a river, frogs and rabbits wrestling, and other scenes where animals behave like humans. Known as the Handscrolls of Frolicking Animals (Ch\u014dj\u016b giga), this work is considered by some to be the foundation of modern manga. The Tale of the Monkeys made in the late 1500s shows monkeys acting out serious and comical human situations. It includes early examples of speech bubbles (fukidashi), and other techniques essential to modern manga \u2013 figures appearing multiple times within a single illustration, a strong sense of visual progression, funny details within a larger scene, and the dominance of visual action over text.\nDiscover more about narrative art in the Citi exhibition Manga, until 26 August.\nSupported by Citi.\nLogistics partner IAG Cargo."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/eighty-years-and-more-of-sutton-hoo/", "category": "Curator's corner", "title": "Eighty years (and more) of Sutton Hoo", "author": "Sue Brunning, Curator of Early Medieval European Collections", "timestamp": "2019-07-24 00:00:00", "text": "When I was a first-year history undergraduate, I came to the British Museum on a field trip. The Anglo-Saxon period was brand new to me at the time \u2013 the only reason I knew of \u2018Sutton Hoo\u2019 and its fame was because a helmet that had been found there was on the front of my textbook. What I saw that day changed the course of my life and set me on the path to becoming curator here at the Museum. But what is Sutton Hoo and why did it cast such a spell on me? Now is the perfect time to reflect on these questions, because this summer marks 80 years since this incredible discovery was first brought to light.\nThe Sutton Hoo ship during excavation, 1939.\nThe Sutton Hoo ship burial is one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of all time. In simple terms, it is the grave of a Very Important Person who died in the early seventh century, during the Anglo-Saxon period. This was a time before \u2018England\u2019 existed. Instead, there was a group of smaller warring kingdoms that would not coalesce into a single realm for another three centuries.\nAn ancient kingdom\nSutton Hoo lay within the kingdom of East Anglia (today the region of Suffolk and Norfolk), which was apparently pretty mighty when the burial took place. But calling it simply a \u2018burial\u2019 feels inadequate. It was, in fact, a spectacular funerary monument comprising a 27-metre-long ship beneath an earth mound nearly three metres high and 30 metres in diameter.\nAt its heart was a burial chamber, the deceased\u2019s final resting place, surrounded by eye-popping riches \u2013 gold dress accessories set with Sri Lankan garnets, silver vessels from distant Byzantium, fine feasting equipment, deluxe hanging bowls, luxurious woven textiles, a stag-topped whetstone carved with human faces.\nGold shoulder clasps inlaid with garnet cloisonn\u00e9 and glass, Britain, c. AD 560\u2013610.\nGold belt buckle, Britain, early 7th century AD.\nThere was also glittering war equipment including a pattern-welded sword, a massive decorated shield, a unique coat of mail armour and the iconic helmet with its enigmatic face formed by the body of a flame-winged dragon.\nIron and tinned copper alloy helmet, Britain, early 7th century AD.\nA Herculean feat\nJust take a moment to imagine the time, effort and workforce involved in realising this vision of eternal commemoration \u2013 dragging the ship up from the river below, digging the huge trench, manoeuvring the ship into it, cutting and preparing the trees for the chamber, building the chamber, dressing it with incredible finery and then raising the towering mound. If I could go back in time, I\u2019d go to that funeral. Make no mistake \u2013 the person buried at Sutton Hoo was meant to be remembered. It\u2019s no wonder that he\u2019s thought to have been no less than a King of East Anglia, although his identity is lost to time like his bodily remains, claimed by the acidic local soil to leave only a human-shaped gap among the treasures within.\nThe Sutton Hoo Anastasius Dish, silver, Britain, AD 491\u2013518.\nWar time excavations\nThe tale of the burial\u2019s discovery is no less dramatic. In 1939, with Britain on the brink of the Second World War, Sutton Hoo landowner Edith Pretty asked local archaeologist Basil Brown to excavate the largest of several burial mounds on her estate. He\u2019d dug adjacent mounds the previous year but found only fragments of Anglo-Saxon artefacts looted centuries before. Crucially, however, one had contained iron rivets, showing that the mound once covered a ship burial \u2013 so when Brown discovered more inside the largest mound, he realised what he was onto. Over the course of the summer, Brown and a growing team excavated the richest intact burial ever found in Europe. The dig was thrillingly documented in hundreds of photographs, drawings, film and first-hand accounts from those who were there. Brown\u2019s own diary is a precious artefact in its own right, more like a scrapbook overflowing with stories, photographs, sketches, watercolours, newspaper clippings and pasted-in letters that leave no doubt of the impression this experience made upon him.\nDiary of Basil Brown, including watercolour of the Sutton Hoo burial mound before excavation.\nIt\u2019s hard not to get excited when he relates his first glimpse of the gold treasures, which \u2018shone in the sunshine as on the day they were buried\u2019 (below). In August 1939, a coroner\u2019s inquest ruled that the ship burial\u2019s contents belonged to Mrs Pretty under the terms of the Treasure Trove law but, in an act of supreme generosity, she gifted it to the nation, which is how it entered the British Museum collection. To this day it is still one of the Museum\u2019s \u2018must-see\u2019 objects for visitors from across the globe.\nThe Sutton Hoo collection is significant for its sheer majesty alone, but its true significance lies in how it revolutionised our knowledge and appreciation of the era \u2013 and the people \u2013 that created it. Previously it was thought that post-Roman Britain descended into the \u2018Dark Ages\u2019, when these islands supposedly experienced a decline in civilisation, sophistication and cosmopolitanism in all areas of life Sutton Hoo helped to explode that myth forever. This single burial in a pretty corner of Suffolk embodied a society of remarkable artistic achievement, complex belief systems and far-reaching international connections, not to mention immense personal power and wealth. The imagery of soaring timber halls, gleaming treasures, powerful kings and spectacular funerals in the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf could no longer be read as legends \u2013 they were reality, at least for the privileged few in early Anglo-Saxon society.\nDiary of Basil Brown, describing his first sight of Sutton Hoo\u2019s gold treasures.\nThis was only the beginning. Sutton Hoo\u2019s spell has grown in power in the 80 years since its discovery. We now know that the mound cemetery containing the ship burial was part of a wider landscape of human activity that reached back for millennia, beyond the Anglo-Saxon era. Research on the Staffordshire Hoard, another gobsmacking Anglo-Saxon discovery made in 2009, revealed that the goldsmiths responsible for Sutton Hoo\u2019s treasures could manipulate the material to enhance its qualities, using methods that can barely be fathomed.\nIn other recent discoveries, British Museum scientists found that black tarry lumps in the burial were actually pieces of bitumen that had originated beneath the hot Middle Eastern sun before they ended up beneath the damp, cool Suffolk earth. And my own study of the Sutton Hoo sword has convinced me that its owner was left-handed. Patterns of wear on Anglo-Saxon sword hilts often show us that the sword\u2019s owner wore it at their left hip, enabling them to draw it across their body with their right hand. On the Sutton Hoo sword these wear patterns are reversed \u2013 suggesting it was worn on the right side and carried in the left hand. This characteristic may have made the person buried at Sutton Hoo even more singular in the community.\nGold sword upper guard-plate, Britain, 6th century AD.\nThis will not be the end of the story. New discoveries, modes of analysis and ways of thinking are sure to uncover even more exciting and mind-bending tales about this very special burial over the next 80 years. 2099\u2019s Sutton Hoo blog is bound to be a good one!\nThe Sutton Hoo ship-burial is on permanent display, year-round, in Room 41 at the British Museum. A small display of archival material relating to Sutton Hoo is now on display in Room 2, until September 2019, to commemorate the 80th anniversary of its discovery.\nThe site of Sutton Hoo is run by the National Trust. The Exhibition Hall and Tranmer House is due to reopen in late summer 2019 following a major redevelopment but the estate, walks, Royal Burial Ground, shop and caf\u00e9 are open to visitors.

Known as \u2018Orientalism\u2019, this representation of the East in Western art often blurred the line between fantasy and reality. Ranging from painting and decorative arts, interior design to architecture, the objects and artworks depict or refer to subjects and styles from the Islamic World, primarily the Middle East and North Africa.\nThe Orientalist art movement reached its height during the 19th century and is perhaps best known for its production of impressive oil paintings and works on paper. This movement, however, in fact stems from as early as the 15th century and continues to be referenced in art today. It has influenced the production of a wide range of works of art including ceramics, metalwork, photography, to name a few, but also extends more widely to include theatre, architecture and music.\nThe Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said\u2019s influential text Orientalism brought\u00a0critical attention to the subject in 1978, questioning the ways in which the West has envisaged and misrepresented the East in culture. In it he criticised the often over-romanticised and inaccurate representations the West has presented of the East, or the \u2018Orient\u2019, particularly through literature and extending into politics. He defined the Orient as being \u2018the place of Europe\u2019s greatest and richest and oldest colonies, the source of its civilizations and languages, its cultural contestant, and one of its deepest and most recurring images of the Other\u2019. To tackle such an enormous subject goes well beyond the scope of this exhibition, which focuses on the art movement of Orientalism. Here, we engage with such critiques, by recognising issues of misrepresentation whilst also identifying a long and rich history of influence and exchange in both directions. A human propensity to know and understand people and places.\nSchool of Veronese (1528\u20131588), A Portrait of Sultan Bayezid I. Oil on canvas, c. 1580.\n\u00a9 Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia.\nIndeed, for centuries Europe defined itself in relation to its Middle Eastern neighbours. From around 1500, as Europeans became both increasingly curious and aggressive in their dealings with those outside their borders, there was a sustained awareness of the empires of the Middle East. These Eastern neighbours were the Safavid Empire (1501\u20131722), centred around modern Iran, and the Ottoman Empire (about 1300\u20131924), which comprised modern-day Turkey, most of south-eastern Europe and the Arabic-speaking lands. Likewise, European traders and diplomats were considered an exotic \u2018other\u2019 by people in the Middle East. At a time when relations between Europe and the Middle East were more evenly balanced than in later periods, this was a period marked by exchange and fluidity.\nThis can be seen in the imitation of certain styles, for example, in this Iznik plate from the 17th century. It was known as a centre for high-quality pottery production for centuries. The distinctive floral designs were also popular on tiles that decorated the inside of buildings during the Ottoman period (c.14th \u2013 20th century).\nGlazed and gilded pottery dish, Iznik, Turkey. Ottoman dynasty, 1601\u20131625.\nThe second image shows tiles made by English designer William De Morgan in the 19th century. He was influenced by Middle Eastern ceramics and designs, creating floral motifs that appeared in fashionable ceramics, stained glass and furnishings.\nFour earthenware tiles, decorated by William De Morgan (1839\u20131917) at Sands End Pottery, Fulham, 1888\u20131897.\nAs Europeans increasingly looked outward to the Americas, Africa and Asia from the 1500s, they developed new ways of visualising, identifying and disseminating information about the people they encountered. Costume books became a popular way of \u2018classifying\u2019 different groups according to their dress, from sultans and mystics to dancers. However, these portrayals could often be based on stereotypes and helped perpetuate them in Europe.\nThe presence of Europeans in Middle Eastern cities also provided local artists with the chance to indulge their own taste for the \u2018exotic\u2019 in portraits of European dandies and courtiers.\nLevni (active c. 1703\u20131730), leading artist at the court of Sultan Ahmet III, A European gentleman in a red coat. Ottoman School painting, Turkey, early 1700s.\nArguably the best-known artistic output of the Orientalist art movement was a huge body of paintings by European and North American artists. Many of these artists travelled to the places they depicted, whether Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), Jerusalem, Cairo or Marrakesh. Others travelled no further than Paris or Vienna, but used a mixture of photographs, props and imagination for inspiration. Recurring images included everything from detailed sketches of daily life to imagined scenes of the harem. Interest in Orientalism developed in tandem with European colonial interests in the Middle East, which allowed soldiers, traders and artists greater access to the places and peoples of the region.\nFrederick Arthur Bridgman (1847\u20131928), The Prayer. Oil on canvas, 1877.\n\u00a9 Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia.\nIn the exhibition we examine the idea of Orientalism, offering another look at this cultural relationship, revealing that Orientalism encompasses many types of visual and decorative arts \u2013 not just painting, as is often assumed. Orientalist objects with origins in Europe, North America, the Middle East and North Africa as diverse as ceramics, photography, glass, jewellery and clothing, and contemporary art highlight a centuries-old tradition of influence and exchange from East to West and West to East, whether gained through diplomatic encounters, spoils of war, or simply through travel. They range from objects that were created by early Western pilgrims visiting the Holy Land to ceramics that were made by 19th-century Western artists directly copying earlier versions from Turkey or Iran.\nAlthough Orientalism remains a highly charged and contested term, with Orientalist arts and crafts rapidly declining in popularity from the 1940s, its visual language remains a potent resource for artists today. The exhibition concludes with four contemporary reactions to the imagery of Orientalism by Middle Eastern and North African female artists. These works \u2013 including Inci Eviner\u2019s 2009 video work Harem and Lalla Essaydi\u2019s Women of Morocco triptych \u2013 answer Orientalist representations of the East, subverting and undermining works by earlier European and North American artists.\nLalla Essaydi (b. 1956), Les Femmes du Maroc. Triptych of photographic prints, 2005.\nThis triptych is from a series of photographs in which Essaydi reimagines the harem paintings of 19th-century Orientalism. Here, women are active agents rather than passive objects subjected to the voyeuristic imaginings of European artists, such as Delacroix, whose Femmes d\u2019Alger is referenced by the series title. Essayadi replaces the bright colours, nudity and luxury of Orientalist paintings with monochrome settings, fully clothed women and strings of Arabic letters, taking back ownership of their representation.\nInspired by the east: how the Islamic world influenced western art is open\u00a0from 10 October 2019 \u2013 26 January 2020.

He frequently depicted scenes from the Bible, as was customary in Europe in the 17th century, but Rembrandt depicted these familiar stories in new ways. He was an extremely innovative printmaker, exploiting the possibilities of etching and drypoint techniques to create a wide range of tonal effects that were key to creating the light, space and atmosphere so important in his storytelling.\nThe artist was a keen observer of life, and he studied a broad range of society both in the home\u00a0and in the streets of Amsterdam, where he lived for most of his career. Rembrandt used his character studies to imbue biblical scenes with personality \u2013 he incorporated emotions and gestures observed from life into his scenes from the Bible, showing familiar stories in a more contemporary way. He carefully composed narratives and populated his scenes with figures observed from his own experience.\nHe didn\u2019t always depict the best-known part of a story \u2013 instead he focused on emotionally charged moments just before the climax, or introspective moments showing figures in quiet thought. In crowded compositions, he depicted individual figures in a remarkable array of responses. Rembrandt was such an effective storyteller, that even 350 years after his death, we can recognise and connect with his portrayal of human character in his scenes from the Bible \u2013 the fear, grief, revelation, transformation and ecstasy of the human encounter with the divine.\nRembrandt van Rijn (1606\u20131669), Death of the Virgin, 1639, Etching and drypoint, state II/V.\nThe Death of the Virgin had a long history of representation by the time Rembrandt turned to the subject in 1639. Prints of the subject by earlier German artists Martin Schongauer and Albrecht D\u00fcrer\u00a0were known to Rembrandt, who was an avid print collector. He never travelled outside his native Holland, so it was through prints that he learned about older traditions of art, both Italian and northern European.\nIn this work, Rembrandt borrowed the depiction of the bed from earlier versions of the same subject. But he increased the dynamism of the scene by adding in life-like details \u2013 a man adjusts the Virgin\u2019s pillow, and another figure tenderly takes her pulse \u2013 Rembrandt must have observed similar moments at home with his wife Saskia, who was bed-ridden before her premature death in 1642. The groups of figures show a wide range of responses in the scene \u2013 concerned figures look on from behind the bed, and a woman to the right of the bed is shown in a heightened state of anguish. Curious figures peer into the scenes from both sides.\nIn Rembrandt\u2019s religious prints, light is imbued with significance, and darkness presents a technical challenge that gains symbolic meaning \u2013 the artist constantly searched for new ways of representing the divine through line and light. Late in his life, in the 1650s, he made his darkest and most technically complex prints of Christ\u2019s Passion. For these large prints, he worked entirely in drypoint, a delicate technique involving scratching directly into the copper plate with a sharp needle, which quickly wore down. When he reworked the worn plates, Rembrandt introduced drastic changes that altered the narrative. As was characteristic of his late style, he omitted detail, and instead used darkness to evoke despair.\n\nRembrandt van Rijn (1606\u20131669), The Three Crosses, 1653, drypoint on vellum, state I/V and The Three Crosses, 1653, drypoint with surface tone, state IV/V.\nIn the first state of The Three Crosses (left), Rembrandt depicted the Crucifixion in accordance with the gospels of St Luke, which describes a large group, both Christians and non-believers, reacting to the events \u2013 some look up in horror, others turn away. Rembrandt subsequently reworked the plate and removed much of the composition, and in the fourth state (right) he plunged the scene into darkness, broken only by the bright shaft of light emanating from the heavens. This later state shows the exact moment that Christ died on the cross. St John, shown pulling his hair in anguish in the earlier state, is now seen thrusting his arms outward in imitation of the crucified Christ.\nIn this episode of Christ\u2019s Passion, we see the precise moment of judgment. The two different states show how different Rembrandt\u2019s prints of the same subject could be.\n\nRembrandt van Rijn (1606\u20131669), Christ Presented to the People, 1655, drypoint on Japan paper, state I/VIII and Christ Presented to the People, 1655, drypoint on Japan paper with surface tone, state VI/VIII.\nPontius Pilate, on the podium, has just asked the gathered crowd to decide Christ\u2019s fate. A man to the left of the podium holds an ewer and basin for Pilate to wash his hands. Rembrandt drew inspiration from an earlier print of the subject by his compatriot Lucas van Leyden, and expanded the architectural setting considerably.\nChrist is barely discernible in the first state of the print (left) \u2013 the large crowd gathered below dominates the composition, and although most figures are seen from the back, Rembrandt manages to convey incredible movement and energy. Figures from all sides crane their necks to see the figure on the podium. In a dramatic reworking of the plate, Rembrandt eliminated the gathered crowd in the sixth state of the print (right). Christ is dwarfed by the vacuous setting and now the viewer of the print is implicated in this critical moment of judgment.\nRembrandt van Rijn (1606\u20131669) Christ healing the sick (\u2018The Hundred Guilder print\u2019), around 1648. Etching, drypoint and engraving on Japan paper, state I/IV. Bequeathed by the Rev. C. M. Cracherode in 1799.\nThis etching is the culmination of Rembrandt\u2019s abilities as a storyteller, complemented by his incredible command of printmaking techniques. The subject matter is a series of events from the life of Christ from chapter 19 of St Matthew\u2019s gospels. Rembrandt deftly brought four episodes together \u2013 Christ is shown at centre, with the sick and elderly on the right, women and children on the left, and the Pharisees on the far left.\nThe luminous light radiating from Christ takes on a symbolic quality, and the shadow of the sick man at his immediate right is reflected in Christ\u2019s robes. Christ\u2019s right hand is raised, as he is about to offering a blessing to the sick, who are queuing to the right. Christ encourages children to approach his with his left hand \u2013 an energetic boy seen from the back runs to him and urges his mother to follow him. The camel peering out of the darkness at far right refers to the passage in the gospels that states it is more difficult for a rich man to enter heaven than it is for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle.\nRembrandt: thinking on paper is open in Room 90 until 4 August 2019.

It was wonderful to visit many great institutions and to meet inspiring colleagues. Our work around the UK through the National Programmes enables us to share our collection, as well as knowledge and expertise with a wider audience. This sharing process works both ways, as we frequently benefit from the strength of our partners\u2019 expertise and collections by borrowing objects for our temporary exhibitions, the exchange has led to some fantastic collaborations with the insights learnt from skill-sharing.\nHartwig Fischer, Iain Watson and Bill Griffiths at Arbeia South Shields\u2019 Roman Fort \u00a9 Scarlet Butterfly Media\nThe week began on Tuesday with a highly informative and productive meeting with Newcastle University colleagues at the Great North Museum, set up by Iain Watson (Director of Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums), to talk about academic and research partnerships. It was also wonderful to visit our Partnership Gallery focusing on Ancient Egypt and to see the large numbers of children visiting the museum. That evening, I had the pleasure of taking part in a public conversation at Arbeia Roman Fort in South Shields with Iain Watson and Bill Griffiths, where we discussed the importance of engaging with communities and the long and fruitful partnership with the British Museum. Iain and his team have ambitious plans to realise the full potential of Arbeia and the nearby Segedunum Roman Fort as part of the Hadrian\u2019s Wall World Heritage Site and it was great to discuss all of this with Councillor Iain Malcolm, Leader of South Tyneside Council.\nHartwig Fischer and Geoff Woodward at Arbeia South Shields\u2019 Roman Fort \u00a9 Scarlet Butterfly Media\nIt is clear that investment in these heritage sites will benefit local communities and the economy by attracting more tourism to the area. We have been delighted to play our role so far in supporting their plans and the next day I met with councillors to hear about these exciting regeneration plans in full and to reiterate the strength of our partnership. I also managed to include a fascinating trip to Jarrow Hall where I met with Leigh Venus, the Bede Museum, including the church and ruins of the monastery where the great Benedictine monk Bede worked. The final visit of the day was to the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, which I have always admired.\nInside and on top of the tower of Durham Cathedral\nThursday heralded a trip to Durham Cathedral, where we were met by the Dean, Andrew Tremlett, and had a tour of Open Treasure, the newly designated exhibition spaces, charting the superbly intact medieval monastic buildings and the treasures relating to St Cuthbert. It was then a treat to head up all 325 steps of the newly restored cathedral tower before it was open to the public. Following this, we visited the Oriental Museum, which will be hosting a new Prints and Drawings touring exhibition early next year as part of our National Programmes. We ended the day with The Bowes Museum to see the beautiful Silver Swan automaton and a tour of their collections and have the chance to discuss future opportunities for partnership working with Peter Mothersill (Chair of the Board of Trustees) and Jane Whittaker (Head of Collections).\nDurham Cathedral\nEarly on Friday we met with Reyahn King, (Chief Executive of York Museums Trust) and Emma Hamlett (Head of Collections and Curatorial Services at York Castle Museum) in York to hear about the vital role they are playing in the city\u2019s cultural and urban development project, The Castle Gateway Masterplan. The project team are working closely with local citizens to deliver the best solution for the city, its residents and visitors. The aim is to increase the understanding of the castle site\u2019s history, archaeology and its contribution to prison history in the national story through high quality design. To get to this stage, it is incredibly important for every cultural project to build relationships and trust with communities, local businesses and other stakeholders.

Spread by travelling storytellers, it was cast into powerful words by the Greek poet Homer as early as the eighth to seventh century BC \u2013 and into powerful images by ancient Greek and Roman artists. Just as it enraptured audiences in the past, it still speaks to us today and it\u2019s easy to see why. It\u2019s a story that has it all \u2013 love and loss, courage and passion, violence and vengeance, triumph and tragedy \u2013 on a truly epic scale.\nSpanning several decades, the tale is set in Greece\u2019s mythical past. At its heart is the powerful city of Troy on the western coast of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), besieged for 10 years by the Greeks, who sailed across the Aegean Sea to take revenge for a grave insult \u2013 the abduction of a woman. This ancient world war features a stellar cast of characters. Even the gods are involved.\nBut this isn\u2019t a straightforward tale of right and wrong. Its heroes \u2013 and none more so than the great Achilles \u2013 are complex, with heroic strength but human weaknesses and in the end it is unclear who, if anyone, really wins.\nThe Greek hero Achilles kills the Amazon queen Penthesilea, fighting on the Trojan side, on a black-figure amphora from c. 530BC. According to one version of the story, at the very moment of her death, their eyes meet and he falls in love with her.\nJudgement of Paris\nThe story starts with a wedding. The sea-goddess Thetis is marrying a mortal man and all the gods and goddesses are invited except one \u2013 Eris, the goddess of discord. Angered, she throws a golden apple into the party, bearing the inscription \u2018to the most beautiful\u2019. Three goddesses all claim it for themselves, and the king of the gods, Zeus, not willing to get involved himself, picks the Trojan prince Paris as the judge. The goddess of love, Aphrodite, wins the competition as she has promised Paris possession of the most beautiful women on earth, Helen. There\u2019s just one problem. Helen is already married to Menelaus, king of the Greek city of Sparta.\nThis Etruscan tomb-painting shows the Judgement of Paris. At the left, Paris awaits the three goddesses. Aphrodite, last of the three, lifts her dress to show off a flash of leg. On the right, Helen is approached by three women bringing jewellery and perfume.\n\n\nThe face that launched a thousand ships\nParis, prince of Troy, comes to Sparta on a state visit but, outrageously, leaves with his host\u2019s wife Helen, queen of Sparta. To bring Helen back and restore his honour, the deceived husband, King Menelaus, assembles a huge army of Greek heroes. Its leader is Menelaus\u2019 brother Agamemnon, king of the powerful Greek city of Mycenae. The army sails to Troy, sets up camp and lays siege to the city. But Troy has strong walls and the Trojans defend the city bravely, throughout nine long years of fighting. The Greeks succeed, however, in raiding neighbouring Trojan cities, taking some inhabitants as prisoners. Among them is Briseis, a young woman who is given to Greek hero Achilles as a prize of honour.\nSome think Paris abducted Helen, others say she fell in love and followed him willingly. The South Italian artist of this vessel suggests the blame lies with the gods. Aphrodite stands directly behind Helen, who is lifting her veil to Paris for the first time. Below, Eros playfully allows a dog to chase a goose, perhaps suggesting infatuated humans are just a plaything of the gods.\nThe rage of Achilles\nIn the 10th year of the Trojan War, dramatic events unfold, as told in Homer\u2019s Iliad. King Agamemnon, the leader of the Greek forces, seizes Briseis for himself. Furious, Achilles withdraws from battle, together with his troops. Achilles\u2019 mother, the sea goddess Thetis, asks Zeus to favour the Trojans for a while, so that Agamemnon will regret dishonouring her son. In the fighting that follows, the Trojans gain ground and are able to set up camp on the plain, alarmingly close to the Greek ships. Desperate to drive them back, Achilles\u2019 close friend and perhaps lover, Patroclus, disguises himself in the armour of Achilles and leads the Greeks into battle, hoping to raise Greek morale and intimidate the Trojans.\u00a0 At first the plan works, but Patroclus is killed by the Trojan prince Hector. In a state of grief-stricken rage, desperate for vengeance against Hector, Achilles sets aside his quarrel with Agamemnon.\nOn this Athenian drinking cup Achilles sits withdrawn and angry inside his tent, heavily wrapped in his cloak, as two heralds lead away his prize, the enslaved woman Briseis.\n\nThe death of Hector\nAchilles returns to battle, wearing new armour brought by his mother. Victory once more favours the Greeks \u2013 and Achilles succeeds in killing Hector.\nAchilles and Hector face each other in combat. Achilles lunges forward while Hector falls back, his wounded chest exposed.\nConsumed by rage and grief, he does not allow Hector\u2019s body to be reclaimed by the Trojans for the customary funeral. Instead he desecrates it by dragging it behind his chariot, as Hector\u2019s horrified family watch from the walls of Troy. Over the coming days he repeatedly drags the body in the dust. But the gods take pity on Hector and his family, preserving Hector\u2019s body from damage and decay. The messenger god, Hermes, helps Hector\u2019s distraught father, Trojan King Priam, to enter the Greek camp secretly. He begs Achilles for the ransom of his son\u2019s body. Achilles\u2019 pitiless need for vengeance subsides and he agrees to Priam\u2019s request. It is an extraordinary, moving encounter, which restores humanity to the hero and a sense of order to the world. The funeral of Hector can now take place. This point in the story is where the Iliad ends.\nTrojan King Priam kisses the hand of Achilles, the man who killed his son. This exquisite Roman silver cup was found in a chieftain\u2019s grave in Denmark.\nImage: Roberto Fortuna and Kira Ursem \u00a9 National Museet Denmark\nThe death of Achilles\nHector is dead, but the war goes on. Troy has not yet fallen and more allies come to the city\u2019s aid, some from far afield. With the help of Achilles, the Greeks defeat both the Amazons (female warriors led by their queen Penthesilea) and the Ethiopians under King Memnon. But Achilles knows that he is fated to die young, for his divine mother once foretold that he would have a short life if he stayed to fight at Troy. It is Paris, the Trojan prince whose abduction of Helen started the war, who kills Achilles. According to one version of the story, Achilles\u2019 divine mother tried to make him invulnerable to injury as a baby, dipping him into the waters of the river Styx. But she held him by one heel \u2013 the famous Achilles\u2019 heel \u2013 and this is the weak point where Paris hits him with an arrow, finally felling the great warrior.\nIn this neoclassical marble sculpture, Wounded Achilles, by Filippo Albacini (1777\u20131858), which was commissioned for the sculpture gallery at Chatsworth House, Achilles grips the arrow which has pierced his heel. \u00a9 The Devonshire Collections, Chatsworth. Reproduced by permission of Chatsworth Settlement Trustees.\nThe fall of Troy\nThe Greeks finally win the war by an ingenious piece of deception dreamed up by the hero and king of Ithaca, Odysseus \u2013 famous for his cunning. They build a huge wooden horse and leave it outside the gates of Troy, as an offering to the gods, while they pretend to give up battle and sail away. Secretly, though, they have assembled their best warriors inside. The Trojans fall for the trick, bring the horse into the city and celebrate their victory. But when night falls, the hidden Greeks creep out and open the gates to the rest of the army, which has sailed silently back to Troy. The city is sacked, the men and boys are brutally slain, including King Priam and Hector\u2019s little son Astyanax, and the women are taken captive. Troy has fallen. But there is still hope for the Trojans\u2019 survival \u2013 Aeneas, the son of King Priam\u2019s cousin, escapes the city with his old father, his young son and a band of Trojan refugees. Aeneas\u2019 story is told in Virgil\u2019s Aeneid.\nRoman sarcophagus lid, late 2nd century AD \u00a9 Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford\nOn this detail of the Roman sarcophagus lid, the wooden horse is being pulled into the city. The splendid wheeled horse is itself armed with helmet and shield \u2013 a suggestion of the warriors hiding within. \u00a9 Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford\nReturning home\nAfter the fall of Troy, the surviving heroes and their troops have little chance to enjoy their victory. The gods are angry because many Greeks committed sacrilegious atrocities during the sacking of Troy. Few Greeks reach their homes easily, or live to enjoy their return. The most difficult, lengthy and action-packed journey is that of Odysseus as told in Homer\u2019s Odyssey. He is forced to travel to the furthest reaches of the Mediterranean Sea, tormented by the sea god Poseidon. He is waylaid by storms, shipwreck and a colourful crowd of strange beings and treacherous people, from the one-eyed giant Cyclops to the Sirens with their mesmerising song. Odysseus finally reaches his homeland, only to find his house besieged by suitors for the hand of his wife who had thought he would not survive his voyage. Yet after 10 years at sea, Odysseus also overcomes this final challenge. He kills the suitors and is reunited with his faithful wife, Penelope.\nWily Odysseus finds a way to hear the Sirens\u2019 beautiful, all-knowing song, without being lured to his death on the dangerous cliffs below. He has his men tie him to the mast of the ship and then seal their own ears with wax so they can row on, immune to the bird women\u2019s irresistible singing.\nWith Odysseus home at last, the events of the Trojan War come to a close. Whether Greek or Trojan, victorious or defeated,\u00a0the heroes and heroines of the\u00a0story\u00a0have enthralled\u00a0audiences from antiquity to today.\nThe BP exhibition Troy: myth and reality ran from 21 November 2019 \u2013 8 March 2020.\nBuy the book accompanying the exhibition here.\nSupported by BP"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-search-for-the-lost-city-of-troy/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "The search for the lost city of Troy", "author": "Alexandra Villing, Curator, Greece and Rome and Lesley Fitton, Honorary Research Fellow", "timestamp": "2019-06-18 00:00:00", "text": "3,000 years ago, the ancient Greek poet Homer told the story of the ill-fated city of Troy and the great Trojan War in his powerful epic, the Iliad. This mythical tale of love and war has\u00a0 captured imaginations ever since. You can read more about the story in our blog here.\nWhile some have argued that the myth of Troy was just that \u2013 a myth \u2013 the allure of the story has led many to search for the site that, according to Homer\u2019s poem, was one of the most important settlements of its time.\nSince antiquity, Troy was believed to be located in an area called the \u2018Troad\u2019 in the northwest corner of modern-day Turkey. For centuries, pilgrims and travellers made the journey to the Troad to stand on the ground where they believed heroes once walked. In the 19th century, a Scotsman and an Englishman, Charles Maclaren and Frank Calvert, were the first to link a hill containing ancient remains with the site of ancient Troy. But the real breakthrough came in 1870, when the German businessman and self-taught archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann travelled to Anatolia with the purpose of uncovering the city and proving the Iliad was based on fact. Since then, the site that Schliemann claimed was \u2018Troy\u2019 has been the subject of extensive excavation and study. Although the evidence can\u2019t prove that the Trojan War really happened, experts now agree that the settlement Schliemann excavated was the famous city\u2026\nThe city of Troy\nThe site of Troy, in the northwest corner of modern-day Turkey, was first settled in the Early Bronze Age, from around 3000 BC. Over the four thousand years of its existence, countless generations have lived at Troy. Although they experienced periods of prosperity, life was not always easy for the Trojans \u2013 houses and fortifications fell to fire, earthquakes or battles and were built anew. The city sometimes grew, sometimes contracted as its people\u2019s fortunes changed.\nAerial view of the site of Troy\nIt is this record of a people and their city that is preserved in archaeology. Each layer of occupation, one on top of the other, represents a phase in the city\u2019s history, which archaeologists over the last 150 years have been exploring. These layers have been labelled\u00a0 Troy I to IX, with Troy I being the earliest settlement and Troy IX the most recent. Much remains to be discovered, but we now know enough today to get a good sense of the city\u2019s development over time.\nIn 1873, Heinrich Schliemann dug a huge trench right through the centre of the mound of Troy. This showed that the mound was made up of the layers of successive settlements.\nTroy begins\nThe original village of Troy (Troy I) was small, but it flourished and grew. By about 2550\u20132300 BC (Troy II) it had strong walls encircling a citadel that was still relatively small, but remarkably prosperous.\nTroy was situated at the entrance to the Dardanelles strait, and in ancient times lay much nearer to the sea than it does today \u2013 the coastline has changed as river deltas have silted up. Its position was key to its prosperity, as the city could trade by sea as well as by land. It may also be that ancient ships, waiting for the wind and currents they needed to pass through the straits, provided a captive market for Trojan goods and services.\nThe city flourishes\nTroy went from strength to strength. By the Late Bronze Age, about 1750\u20131180 BC (Troy VI and VIIa), a larger citadel was enclosed behind impressive sloping walls, parts of which can still be seen at the site today, and there is evidence of a large settlement in the lower town.\nIn its Late Bronze Age heyday, the site was impressive, as this imagined reconstruction shows. \u00a9 Christoph Hau\u00dfner , M\u00fcnchen.\nTrojan wealth was also built on the rich agricultural land in the surrounding area. In the Iliad, the Trojan prince Hector is \u2018tamer of horses\u2019 and horse-breeding may well have played a part in Troy\u2019s prosperity. Horse bones have been found there in quantity, as well as bones showing the rearing and domestication of other animals. Sheep farming must have been particularly important, as there is evidence for extensive textile production at Troy and these textiles may well have been exported. It is only over the past few decades that modern archaeology, including the study of ancient plant and animal remains, has transformed our understanding of all these aspects of life at ancient Troy.\nImagined reconstruction of the South Gate of Troy VI. \u00a9 Christoph Hau\u00dfner , M\u00fcnchen\nTroy and its neighbours \u2013 evidence for the Trojan war?\nDuring the late Bronze Age (1750\u20131180 BC), the city was by far the most important settlement in the area but it was only a small player on the world stage. Troy appears in records from the Hittites (a civilisation which flourished in what is modern-day Turkey) as \u2018Wilusa\u2019, a name related to the Greek \u2018Ilios\u2019/\u2019Ilion\u2019, Homer\u2019s other name for Troy. Towards the end of the Late Bronze Age, Wilusa was a small vassal state (a state without independence) of the mighty Hittite Empire of Anatolia. The capital of the Hittite Empire, Hattusa, was far away to the east near modern-day Bo\u011fazkale in Turkey. From Hattusa, Troy must have seemed a distant backwater. Yet its wealth and dominant position undoubtedly made it a prize. Did the Greeks (who came from \u2018Ahhiyawa\u2019 according to the Hittites, a name related to the \u2018Achaea\u2019 of Homer) look enviously at its prosperity?\nHittite tablet mentioning the city of \u2018Willusa\u2019\nHittite tablets mention the Hittite empire fighting with the people of \u2018Ahhiyawa\u2019 over Wilusa \u2013 could this have been the Trojan War? There is even mention of a ruler there called \u2018Alaksandu\u2019 or Alexandros, which is another name for the Trojan prince Paris in Homer\u2019s poem. This is all such tantalising evidence. Although it falls far short of proof, it builds up the picture of a feasible background for a Trojan War, in the interconnected but combative Late Bronze Age world.\nTroy and Ilion\nTroy fell into ruin at the end of the Bronze Age, around 1180 BC, as did all the centres of power of the Mediterranean world, for reasons that are not completely understood. The site was never completely abandoned, and its ruins must have remained visible for some centuries, probably up to the time of Homer, if the poet lived in the late 8th or early 7th centuries BC as thought. It was not long after this that Troy, known as \u2018Ilion\u2019, became a place of pilgrimage because of its heroic associations. The name Ilion is used by Homer interchangeably with Troy, and it is possible the inhabitants had always called their city something like Ilion, right back to its days as Wilusa.\nA fine temple was built at Troy in the Hellenistic period of the third century BC. This decoration from the temple shows Athena, patron goddess of the city, to whom the temple was dedicated.\n\u00a9 Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Museum f\u00fcr Vor- und Fr\u00fchgeschichte, Foto Philipp Gro\u00df.\nGreek Ilion was a small town, but enriched by what one might call its \u2018tourist trade\u2019 of visitors seeking to pay their respects to the heroes of the past. Greek leaders and Roman emperors endowed it with wealth and privileges, including fine civic buildings. The Troy of the Greek and Roman periods was not otherwise a particularly important place, but it nonetheless flourished until the end of the ancient world (in the 6th century AD), and perhaps even beyond \u2013 there is some evidence for Byzantine settlement on the site as late as the 13th century AD. Troy can therefore be said to have had a lifespan of more than 4,000 years.\nTroy lost\nIt seems completely astonishing that the site of Troy could later have been lost, but it was. Over time, its remains crumbled away to become part of a low hill in a flat landscape that was only sparsely populated. The hill did not seem to be anything special. More noticeable were the \u2018tumuli\u2019, or mounds, dotted around the Trojan plain. These were in fact mostly not Bronze Age but created at different dates in the Greek and Roman periods, mostly for burials. These mounds were very visible in the landscape, and so gave early visitors looking for the heroes the sense that they had found their graves. But the city of Troy, or Ilion, had been lost from view.\nThe search for Troy\nThe search for Troy became a major preoccupation for travellers, topographers, writers and scholars in the 18th and early 19th centuries when ancient Greece and its myths captivated public imagination in Europe. But it was not a simple matter and became a subject of heated debate. The division lay between \u2018realist\u2019 thinkers, who believed the story of Troy must be based on some historical truth, and opponents who claimed it was simply dreamed up in Homer\u2019s poetic imagination and would never be found.\nSilver coin minted in Ilium.\nThe Troad was mapped and explored and the prevalent theory of the \u2018realists\u2019 was that a hill called \u2018Pinarba\u015f\u0131\u2019 had been the site of Troy, but they couldn\u2019t find any evidence. In what should have been a breakthrough, a traveller named Edward Clarke visited a different hill, named \u2018Hissarlik,\u2019 in 1801 and identified it as the site of Ilion. He based this on the evidence of coins and inscriptions he found there. However only later in the 19th century would it dawn that Hissarlik was the site not just of Ilion, but also of legendary Troy, which was underneath the Classical remains.\nTroy found\nFrank Calvert lived in the Troad and owned land next to the mound of Hissarlik. An amateur but skilled archaeologist, he was convinced that there would be a good place to dig. So when Schliemann visited in 1868, with Homer in one hand and a spade in the other, determined to make his name in archaeology, Calvert found him easy to persuade. Calvert helped Schliemann, but it would be Schliemann\u2019s name that became world famous, as the pioneer of archaeology who discovered and revealed the site of ancient Troy.\nWilliam Simpson (1823\u20131899), Excavations at Hissarlik. Watercolour, 1877.\nHuge publicity surrounded Schliemann\u2019s finds. He announced to the world that in what is now called Troy II he had found the city of mythical King Priam and the Troy of the Trojan War. It was here that he discovered silver and gold vessels and jewellery, which he named \u2018Priam\u2019s treasure\u2019 and which he believed included \u2018the jewels of Helen\u2019. His interpretation that the finds were evidence of the Trojan War was questioned at the time and, perhaps sadly for romantics everywhere, it is no longer accepted.\nHeinrich Schliemann liked to believe that the jewellery he found in Troy II had belonged to Helen of Troy. The model here is his Greek wife, Sophia. Credit: bpk\nLater archaeological work at both Troy and on the Greek mainland, particularly at the site of Mycenae (one of the most important settlements of Bronze Age Greece), makes it clear that any feasible background for the story of the war must have been at least a thousand years later than the Troy that Schliemann claimed as \u2018Priam\u2019s Troy.\u2019 Only then was Mycenaean Greece in contact with Troy, and powerful enough for the story to make sense. But of course, Homer was a poet and not a historian. It remains immensely difficult to link the Iliad specifically to the archaeology of Troy.\nPortrait of Heinrich Schliemann in 1877 by Sidney Hodges.\n\u00a9 Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Museum f\u00fcr Vor- und Fr\u00fchgeschichte, Foto Claudia Klein.\nSchliemann\u2019s excavations, between 1870 and 1890, marked the beginning of intensive archaeological exploration at Troy, by various international teams, that continues today, with current research led by Turkish archaeologists. Understanding of the site, its development over time and its place in the ancient world continues to grow. From an archaeological perspective, there is a rich history to be uncovered that stands quite apart from the myth of the Trojan War and is important in its own right.

Although manga\u2019s roots are international, the form as we know it today developed in Japan in the late 19th and 20th centuries and has recently achieved global status. Out of the hundreds of genres, we\u2019ve picked eight key genres explored in the Citi exhibition Manga\u30de\u30f3\u30ac\u00a0. Come and find your manga!\nSh\u00f4jo manga (\u5c11\u5973\u30de\u30f3\u30ac)\nSh\u00f4jo manga is targeted at girls up to the age of 18 and focuses on romance, friendship and comedy. Drawing is idealised, with emotions conveyed through large, expressive eyes and symbols such as flowers. Although the main target audience for sh\u00f4jo manga is girls, boys read it as well and it can be drawn by both male and female artists.\nOne of the pioneers of sh\u00f4jo manga is Tezuka Osamu with his classic series Princess Knight, which tells the story of Sapphire, who was destined to be a girl but was mistakenly also given a male heart by a naughty angel named Tink. Gender identity issues come fast and furious in the ensuing pages of this compelling story.\nTezuka Osamu (1928\u20131989), Princess Knight, 1953\u20131956, 1963\u20131966. \u00a9 Tezuka Productions.\nJosei manga (\u5973\u6027\u30de\u30f3\u30ac)\nJosei manga is a type of manga that targets female readers between the ages of 18 and 40. The drawing is less idealised than in sh\u00f4jo manga, features more mature plot lines than manga for younger female audiences and focuses on realistic romance, among other themes.\nIn Willow Tree, Hagio Moto tells the heartrending tale of the ghost of a mother who watches as the seasons come and go as her son becomes a man.\nHagio Moto (b. 1949), The Willow Tree, 2007. \u00a9 MOTO HAGIO/SHOGAKUKAN INC.\nSh\u00f4nen manga (\u5c11\u5e74\u30de\u30f3\u30ac)\nSh\u00f4nen is a demographic and a category of manga mostly aimed at boys between 10 and 18 years old. Sh\u00f4nen stories are idealised and feature action scenes depicting adventure and/or sports, friendship and struggles with adversity. Similarly themed stories with more advance plotlines, aimed at older males, is called seinen manga. Sh\u00f4nen manga probably has the widest reach of all manga for all readers \u2013 and female audiences also read its titles. The graphic action scenes and riveting story lines that develop through multiple instalments help to make this form addictive. As a result of this popularity it is widely translated into other languages and is some of the best known manga in the UK.\nA classic example of sh\u00f4nen manga is ONE PIECE by Oda Eiichir\u00f4, which tells the adventures of a boy whose body has become rubberised after eating \u2018Gum-Gum fruit\u2019 and who travels the world on a pirate ship in search of the priceless treasure ONE PIECE. The highest grossing manga, it is well-loved and is displayed in the exhibition with the original drawings. Sh\u00f4nen is some of the most successful manga and is often published in magazines, such as Shueisha\u2019s weekly Sh\u00f4nen Jump. Two classic examples of sh\u00f4nen manga, originally published in the Sh\u00f4nen Jump magazine, are Captain Tsubasa by Takahashi Y\u014dichi and Dragon Ball by Toriyama Akira. Both manga feature physical challenges, friendship, teamwork, fights, humour and character development.\nTakahashi Y\u00f4ichi (b. 1960), Captain Tsubasa, 1981\u201388. \u00a9 Yoichi Takahashi/SHUEISHA.\nToriyama Akira (b. 1955), Dragon Ball, 1984\u201395. \u00a9 BIRD STUDIO/SHUEISHA.\nGekiga manga (\u5287\u753b\u30de\u30f3\u30ac)\nGekiga or \u2018Dramatic pictures\u2019 is manga aimed at adults and features complex narratives and cinematographic effects. The master of this manga form is Saito Takao, who at 82 is still drawing manga. His Golgo 13 started being published in 1968 in Shogakukan\u2019s Big Comic every two weeks. It features Duke Togo, a professional assassin and man of few words known as Golgo 13. The name strikes fear into his targets \u2013 it was taken from Golgotha, the hill where Christ was crucified and 13, an unlucky number.\nSaito Takao (b. 1936), Golgo 13, 1968 onwards. \u00a9 Takao Saito/SHOGAKUKAN INC.\nBoys\u2019 love manga (\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30ba\u30e9\u30d6\u30de\u30f3\u30ac)\nSh\u00f4nen-ai \u00a0or \u2018Boys\u2019 love\u2019 features romance between boys, however most \u2018BL\u2019 artists are women and it is aimed at a female audience. The focus is on the blossoming of romance between young men, often with deep emotional resonances.\nA BL pioneer is Takemiya Keiko. Her seminal Kaze to ki no uta (Poem of the Wind and Trees) shaped the field with her delicate rendering of bish\u00f4nen or \u2018beautiful boys\u2019 set in a boarding school in southern France.\nTakemiya Keiko (b. 1950), Kaze to ki no uta (Poem of wind and trees), 1976\u20131984. \u00a9 Keiko TAKEMIYA.\nYoshinaga Fumi, in her successful series What did you eat yesterday, chronicles Kakei Shiro, a lawyer and gourmet who lives with his boyfriend Yabuki Kenji, a salon stylist as they navigate gay life in Japan. It highlights expressions of love, depicted through food in scenes from daily life, as well as touching on ageing and romance. It has proved so popular since it launched that in April 2019 it was made into a live action TV drama.\nYoshinaga Fumi (b. 1971), What did you eat yesterday, 2007. \u00a9 Fumi Yoshinaga/Kodansha Ltd.\nAdventure manga (\u5192\u967a\u30de\u30f3\u30ac)\nAdventure is one of the mainstays of Japanese manga and certainly one of the most popular genres. It is often associated with manga targeted at boys but is widely read by everyone.\nVeteran manga artist Hoshino Yukinobu (who drew a manga about the Museum \u2013 Professor Munakata\u2019s British Museum Adventure, 2011) has recently started a dramatic new adventure story based on the Ming dynasty explorer Zheng He (1371\u20131433/5 AD). Weaving fact with fiction, the story is a page-turner and the drama ranges across all the lands that Zheng was said to have visited.\nHoshino Yukinobu (b. 1954), Ocean Adventurer \u2013 Kaitei, 2018. \u00a9 YUKINOBU HOSHINO/SHOGAKUKAN INC.\nSports manga (\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4\u30de\u30f3\u30ac)\nSports were, and to some extent still are, at the heart of Japanese manga. While the particular sport in focus is shown in detail, often the drama is behind the scenes and focused on the characters\u2019 inner worlds and personal and professional development. This could involve doubt, challenges and sometimes romance. Subject matter includes baseball, basketball, tennis, ballet, golf and football. There probably isn\u2019t a sport that isn\u2019t depicted in manga. The definition of \u2018sport\u2019 is broad and one title shown in the exhibition explores the competitive sport of karuta or traditional card playing, as seen in the current best-selling manga Chihayafuru, by Suetsugu Yuki.\nSuetsugu Yuki (b. 1975), Chihayafuru, 2007 onwards. \u00a9 Yuki Suetsugu/Kodansha Ltd.\nThe most iconic Japanese sports manga is undoubtedly Chiba Tetsuya and Takamori Asao\u2019s Tomorrow\u2019s Joe, which is all about boxing. Serialised in Kodansha\u2019s Weekly Sh\u00f4nen Magazine from 1968, and running 20 individual volumes, it captures the zeitgeist of the nation with the orphan and ex-convict Yabuki Joe, who fought his way to becoming a champion boxer.\nChiba Tetsuya (b. 1939), Tomorrow\u2019s Joe, 1968\u201373. \u00a9 Tetsuya Chiba/Kodansha Ltd.\nComedy manga (\u30b3\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30de\u30f3\u30ac)\nThe comedy manga genre is perpetually popular with readers. Comedy can take many forms in manga but is, at its heart, engaging, funny and occasionally dark. If it does not make you laugh and then think, then it does not have a strong future in the manga publishing world.\nYamazaki Mari (b.1967), Olympia Kyklos, 2018 onwards. \u00a9 Mari Yamazaki/SHUEISHA.\nA winning formula has been discovered by Yamazaki Mari, creator of the huge hit Thermae Romae by using time slips between the ancient past in the Europe and modern Japan. The manga time slips and quick-gags along with word play \u2013 and a sense of the absurd is coupled with solid historical research. Her new series Olympia Kyklos (\u2018Circles\u2019) is about a gentle ancient Greek vase painter who has time travels to Japan during the 1964 Summer Olympics. He is a sensitive soul with deep doubts about his abilities. He is rescued from a sticky situation with a love interest by being in a jar struck by lightning and time travels to 1960s Japan. There he discovers sh\u00f4jo manga and is so moved by the beautiful drawings of characters and the depictions of emotion he starts to cry though he cannot read any text. He travels back to ancient Greece and introduces romance through manga like paintings on his jars when he returns. The rest of this fantastical tale is, of course, history.\nCome and find your manga!\u00a0\u00a0The Citi exhibition\u00a0Manga \u30de\u30f3\u30ac\u00a0 is open from 23 May \u2013 26 August 2019.\nSupported by Citi.\nLogistics partner IAG Cargo.\nFind out more and book tickets."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-british-museum-membercast-exploring-munch/", "category": "Podcasts", "title": "The British Museum Membercast: Exploring Munch", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2019-05-31 00:00:00", "text": "The British Museum Membercast is a monthly podcast made available to \u2018all studious and curious persons\u2019.

The costume (known as a heva\u00a0tu\u00a0papa\u2019u) was worn during the mourning ceremonies following the death of a chief in 18th-century Tahiti, and is one of the most important objects in the British Museum\u2019s collections.\nCollected by Cook in 1774, the outfit is believed to be one of approximately ten he brought to Europe in 1775. Today, only a handful survive, making the British Museum\u2019s near complete assemblage an important document of a now-lost Tahitian practice \u2013 particularly in light of the exciting discoveries that were made during conservation.\nIt is constructed from a range of ritually significant materials \u2013 barkcloth (a material made from tree bark), pearl shell, feather, and coconut shell. For many years the costume stood \u2018dressed\u2019 on a painter\u2019s easel, which posed the first conservation questions.\n\nThe costume displayed on its old mount before extensive conservation\nRecords show the costume was displayed on the easel in the Museum\u2019s South Seas galleries in the early 19th century, and the use of plaited coconut fibre string to tie elements onto the easel suggested that it might have been mounted like this whilst still in the Pacific, perhaps on board the HMS Resolution \u2013 Cook\u2019s ship.\nThe conservation process began by carefully documenting and removing each component of the costume from the easel. It was fascinating to peel away the layers, as we could examine and document each element closely.\nBarkcloth finds\nIt was only when we had fully undressed the costume that we made our most significant discovery.\u00a0 Thought initially to be extra padding, a large bundle of fine barkcloth was found tied to the easel. We decided to carefully unroll it, revealing not one, but two hidden treasures.\nThe first was a large rectangular sheet of finely beaten barkcloth. It was covered in reddish-brown splashes \u2013 identified as hand and finger prints. Although probably not part of the costume itself, its presence suggested another association with the mourning ceremony. Descriptions of the ceremony in Cook\u2019s journals following his first visit to Tahiti in 1769 tell of ritual self-mutilation, suggesting that the marks could be blood, and although on further investigation and analysis these marks turned out to be dye, this piece could still be a representation of a blooded cloth from the ceremony, which itself would have been too sacred for Tahitians to give to Cook.\nThe second discovery was a barkcloth poncho style garment, called a tiputa, very similar, but smaller, to the one already on the costume. Creasing and distortions matching the shape of the easel showed that this had undoubtedly once been part of the assembled outfit. The un-faded, bold red stripes suggested it had hadn\u2019t seen much light since being brought to Europe in the 1770s, and gave us an understanding of the former colour of the now-faded costume.\nThe tiputa\u00a0on the custom-made mount. This smaller, but vividly coloured barkcloth\npiece was discovered rolled up inside the costume.\nThe vivid black, red and yellows shown in contemporary depictions of mourner\u2019s costumes drawn by Herman Diedrich Sporing (below) and the Tahitian Tupaia during Cook\u2019s first voyage began to make sense. Once we started looking, we found evidence of red and yellow dyes on several other pieces.\nA watercolour of the dress of the chief mourner by Herman Diedrich Sporing, who accompanied Cook on his first voyage to Tahiti in 1773. The bright colours of the striped barkcloth dress and cape were reflected in the discovery of red and yellow dyes on the British Museum costume.\nAlthough faded, all of the barkcloth elements of the costume remained in remarkably good condition. The main deterioration has been the absorption of dirt, and creasing and distortion caused by being wrapped around the easel, which required surface cleaning and humidification treatments. Cleaning of the barkcloths was carried out using specialised sponges and cloths, and their creases relaxed with humidification techniques.\nFragile feathers\nMost fragile of all the pieces was perhaps the long feather cloak hanging down the back of the costume, and conserving it was painstaking work.\n\u2018The most fragile part\u2019: every single feather in this cloak, which hangs down the back of the costume, was painstakingly repaired, using narrow strips of paper glued along the shaft to reinforce them.\nThe black feathers, split down the central shaft to make them twist, were bound together in groups and tied onto a plant fibre mesh to form the cloak. The feathers were individually repaired using narrow strips of paper, glued along the shaft in order to reinforce them. Feathers always present a challenge to conservators \u2013 they are intrinsically fragile and many had become detached. They are also vulnerable to pest damage \u2013 especially from the larvae of clothes moths and carpet beetles.\nThe long black feather pendants, hanging either side of the breast plate, had suffered particularly from pest damage which had left obvious bald areas. Conservator Sophie Rowe was able to create \u2018feather toupees\u2019 from feathers that had become detached from the pendants to hide the bald spots, matching similarly sized and shaped feathers, and grouping them into bundles.\nPest damage: the feather pendants had suffered particularly from pest damage and conservator Sophie Rowe created \u2018feather toupees\u2019 from feathers that had become detached to hide bald spots.\nMultiple bird species have been used throughout the costume and British Museum scientist Chris Mussell is currently working with bird expert Hein van Grouw from the Natural History Museum to identify the species.\nConserving shell elements\nCompleting the costume were the distinctive breast plate and face mask. The curved wooden breastplate is decorated with five large pearl shells, and with nearly 1,000 tiny rectangular shell plaques suspended below. The craftsmanship of cutting and drilling each plaque without metal tools is quite incredible.\nThe intricate wooden breastplate features five large pearl shells \u2013 and nearly 1,000 tiny rectangular shell plaques hanging underneath.\nThe mourner\u2019s face would have been completely covered by the shell mask, and there\u2019s only one very small eye hole. Topped with a crest of long white tropic bird feathers, the mask exaggerates the wearer\u2019s height, making an awe-inspiring figure.\nOne of the large shells making up the mask had broken down the middle, and had been repaired in the 1960s using an epoxy adhesive. This glue had left unsightly hard, yellow residues on the surface of the shell. Using innovative laser cleaning techniques, conservator Tania Desloge was able to break down the epoxy. Although normally used in the cleaning of stone artefacts in the Museum, this was the first time laser cleaning technology had been employed in the treatment of organic materials.\nSophie uses special magnifying lenses for the fine work on the costume\u2019s mask.\nWorking closely with scientist Lucia Melita preliminary experiments were conducted using mock up samples of pearl shell and aged epoxy resins to ensure the success and safety of the treatment. The radiation energy from a special Er:YAG laser softened the aged epoxy so it could be picked off with tweezers. Needless to say applying this laser technique to the real object required great care! The shell was then reinforced in a way that could be reversed in the future \u2013 using Japanese paper and fibreglass sheets impregnated with an acrylic adhesive.\nDisplaying the costume\nAfter lengthy discussions with curator Julie Adams, in consultation with visiting experts from Tahiti and the UK, and having carried out research to compare other remaining mourners\u2019 costumes in the UK, Hawaii, Italy and Germany, it was decided to make some significant alterations to the presentation of the costume when reassembling it following the 2018 conservation. This included removing it from the easel mount.\nSpecialist costume mounter Rachel Lee came from the V&A to help conservators mount the costume for display.\nWe wanted to display the costume as it would have been perceived during the ceremony, worn by a person. This was particularly important for visiting Tahitian curator Theano Guillaume Jaillet, who felt that the time had come to move away from feeling constrained by the easel\u2019s possible association with Captain Cook.\nThe development of a new, custom designed mannequin was critical to the costume\u2019s display and long-term preservation. Supportive undergarment now give shape to each part of the costume and carefully fitted mounts hold the breast plate and face mask in place. During display, light levels will be carefully monitored to prevent fading and deterioration of the fibres. After display, the costume will remain on its mount, in an environmentally controlled store with optimal temperature and humidity levels.\nThe newly conserved costume on display in Room 91.\nScientific investigations are still ongoing \u2013 with dyes, feathers and fibres being identified. The discovery of two previously unknown and extremely well-preserved components, as well as never-before-seen decorative elements was a cause for great excitement. Close interaction between the Museum\u2019s curatorial, conservation and science teams, and external Tahitian specialists, has given us a deeper understanding of the importance of this unique object as a record of Tahitian culture, and of early European contact with Tahiti."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/hokusai-the-father-of-manga/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Hokusai: the father of manga?", "author": "Tim Clark, Head of the Japanese Section, British Museum", "timestamp": "2019-05-10 00:00:00", "text": "Walk into a bookshop in Tokyo today and the shelves are packed to bursting with manga books by Tezuka Osamu, Hagio Moto, Inoue Takehiko, Yamazaki Mari, et al.

One big difference, however, is that the industry that produced single-sheet popular colour woodblocks (ukiyo-e) declined rapidly in the early 1900s. We can think about where the urge to create all those cheap, strikingly beautiful pictures might have gone.\nTezuka\u2019s most famous character, internationally, is Astro Boy, Tetsuwan Atomu.\nTezuka Osamu (1928-1989), Atomu Taishi (Atom the Ambassador) \u00a9 Tezuka Productions\n\nSo was it Hokusai who invented manga in 1814? Or was it Tezuka, in 1947? To keep the peace, let\u2019s consider for a moment whether both these propositions might be true. Hokusai did start to issue his Hokusai manga picture books (in Nagoya) in 1814. Tezuka\u2019s first hit in a comic strip-type manga book, New Treasure Island, did come out (in Osaka) in 1947. \u00a0With a bit more time, we could enjoyably debate the somewhat different meanings of \u2018manga\u2019 in 1814 versus \u2018manga\u2019 in 1947. We also need to remember that Tezuka was watching Disney cartoons as much as he was looking at Hokusai prints and books, maybe even more. The history of manga is complicated\u2026\nTo find out what happened to manga in the intervening century, you might want to take a look at this interesting blog by my colleagues Ry\u014dko Matsuba and Alfred Haft:\nManga: a brief history in 12 works\nBut let\u2019s return the story to Hokusai. Between the ages of 16 and 19, Hokusai was training to cut the woodblocks used to print popular books and prints. He\u2019s famously supposed to have cut the last six pages of text for a novel about the Edo brothel district, Yoshiwara, published in 1775. From about the age of 20 he switched to being a print artist, and quite a few of his early designs of kabuki actors have survived. The point is that Hokusai knew the popular print industry inside out \u2013 as a block cutter, author and artist. In the 1780s and 1790s he was regularly designing illustrations for the so-called \u2018yellow cover\u2019 or kiby\u014dshi genre of popular comic fiction; and sometimes writing the stories for them too. In the Manga exhibition catalogue, scholar Adam Kern calls these \u2018comic books\u2019.\nKatsushika Hokusai (1760-1849), Acolyte Manjusri: Precepts for the Young, 1801\nNotwithstanding their modest size and inexpensive woodblock technique, \u2018yellow covers\u2019 were packed with comedy and satire in both their images and their texts (including direct speech between the characters). They were indeed comic books for adults, like modern manga.\nHokusai was an incredibly inventive artist, always trying different genres and subjects, sometimes creating new ones. In the early 1800s, he collaborated with the leading author of long adventure stories, Bakin, to develop the wildly popular genre of popular fiction known as yomihon (literally, \u2018books for reading\u2019). Hokusai developed a new style of action-packed illustrations that were filled, often literally, with explosive drama.\nKatsushika Hokusai (1760-1849), Strange Tales of the Bow Moon, 1807\nNarrative and dialogue were interspersed, every few pages, with Hokusai\u2019s exciting images. You could argue that these are important precursors, albeit distant in time, of the equally explosive \u2018dramatic picture\u2019 (gekiga) style of manga art that has developed since the 1960s, initially in the pages of the magazine Garo (1964 \u2013 2002). In the 1980s, gekiga artist Sait\u014d Takao created a gripping story in this dramatic style about the early medieval sculptor Unkei.\nIn the 1810s, Hokusai was particularly busy producing \u2018picture manuals\u2019 (e-dehon), commercially printed drawing manuals full of pictures to copy, that spread his style widely in the general population throughout Japan, not just in Edo (Tokyo). The most famous of these, was Hokusai manga (15 volumes, 1814 \u2013 1878). The preface to volume one makes it clear that this title was suggested by Hokusai himself, a still unusual use of the word manga, which can playfully be translated as \u2018brush running away with itself\u2019. The preface also refers to Hokusai\u2019s \u2018divine skill\u2019 and the ambition \u2018to transmit his spirit\u2019. When we look at a typical double-page opening from volume one, we see an inventive and playful arrangement of lots of Buddhist monks, some (for those who knew) alluding to famous characters from history.\nKatsushika Hokusai (1760-1849), Buddhist monks, from Hokusai manga, 1814\nThe pictures are gently humorous and there is no text or dialogue. The meaning of manga here, then, seems to be something like light-hearted, somewhat random pictures for a mainstream audience. In spirit, they do have quite a lot in common with the atmosphere of modern manga.\nIn working on Hokusai over the last few years and spending a lot of time with his art, I\u2019ve come to wonder if he wasn\u2019t one of the most important inventors of modern animation. This is particularly apparent in the \u2018freeze-frame\u2019 technique of his masterpiece print \u2018The Great Wave\u2019 of about 1831, in which the wave is drawn so that the myriad tentacles of foam stretch forward to the maximum, just before it is about to fall. Because of the way the picture is so imaginatively composed, we feel an incredible surge of energy in the sea from right to left and on up into the wave.\n\nKatsushika Hokusai (1760-1849), The Great Wave, about 1831\nAnother gripping example from almost the same date, about 1833, is the terrifying rictus grin and staring empty eye sockets of the skeleton of Koheiji. The skeleton\u2019s bony fingers are pulling down the mosquito net to menace Koheiji\u2019s sleeping wife, who had conspired with her lover and murdered him. Everything about the picture is set up to give instant, creepy intelligibility.\n\nKatsushika Hokusai (1760-1849), Ghost of Kohada Koheiji, about 1833\nAgain, it\u2019s a kind of freeze-frame, with the implication of bloody mayhem to follow. Now we take such techniques for granted. It was Hokusai who invented them, and his block cutters and printers who skilfully translated them into such memorable graphic images, for all to enjoy. \u00a0Manga and ukiyo-e are both admirably democratic forms of popular art."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-world-exists-to-be-put-on-a-postcard/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "The World Exists To Be Put On A Postcard", "author": "Jennifer Ramkalawon, Curator of Western Modern and Contemporary Graphic Works", "timestamp": "2019-05-07 00:00:00", "text": "Artists working with postcards from the 1960s onwards have largely been concealed and overlooked in the history of contemporary art.

The experimental Fluxus artist Ben Vautier created what must be one of the most confusing postcards ever made. It reveals a space on both sides of the card for the address, enabling the writer to send the card to two people at once. When it arrives at the post office, the question is, \u2018who should it be posted to\u2019? This dilemma is reflected in the title of the card, The Postman\u2019s Choice.\nBen Vautier, The Postman\u2019s Choice, 1965\u20131967.\nMany women artists used mail art for their own experimental projects. The postcard was a way for these artists to bypass the traditional gallery system from which, as women artists, they felt excluded, and to disseminate their work to a wider audience. Between 1971\u20131973 Eleanor Antin sent 51 postcards of her 100 Boots project to 1,000 people in the art world.\u00a0 During a two-and-half year trip around California, she placed the Wellington boots in various incongruous settings, recording each one.\nEleanor Antin, Digression #1, 1971. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nThe postcard was often the only record of a performance piece as seen in the work of Stelarc. Stelios Arcadiou was born in Cyprus and grew up in Melbourne, Australia, changing his name in 1972 to Stelarc. He specialised in self-inflicting performances in which his body was suspended from hooks. His preferred method of documenting and promoting his work was through postcards. This postcard documents a piece called Event for Lateral Suspension, recording the event on 12 March 1978 at the Tamura Gallery, Tokyo.\nStelarc, Event for lateral suspension, 1978. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nSome of the most innovative postcard work appears in graphic form from conceptual group Art & Language\u2019s remarkable composite \u2018jigsaw\u2019 piece \u2018postcard\u2019, to the bold letterpress cards of Simon Cutts, whose card The World Exists To Be Put On A Postcard the exhibition is named after.\nArt & Language, 10 Postcards, 1977.\nSmall, produced in large numbers and able to be sent undetected though the post, the postcard form is subversive and can be very effective in spreading political messages.\u00a0Postcards in the exhibition include comments on feminism, AIDs and aspects of war \u2013 most notably Yoko Ono and John Lennon\u2019s anti-Vietnam war card of 1969\u20131970 War is Over!.\nYoko Ono and John Lennon, War is Over!, 1969\u20131970. \u00a9 Yoko Ono and John Lennon 1969.\nMany artists are fond of altering existing postcards. Some in the exhibition have been burnt, cut away, added to (by collage), erased or have had their original surface entirely obliterated. Here the sculptor Rachel Whiteread (herself an enthusiastic postcard collector) has punched holes into a mundane tourist postcard of an alpine scene, almost rendering it into a kind of 2D sculpture.\nRachel Whiteread, Untitled, 2005. \u00a9 Rachel Whiteread. Courtesy of Rachel Whiteread.\nIn the age of the internet and social media, posting a card seems like an archaic activity, yet some contemporary artists have embraced the postcard and many feature in the exhibition, including this work by David Shrigley with his typically wry take on the art world. Here Shrigley references Damien Hirst\u2019s work from the nineties, which often involved rotting carcasses in vitrines.\nDavid Shrigley, Brilliant!, 2007. Copyright David Shrigley.\nJeremy Cooper\u2019s gift offers a snapshot of life in the 20th and 21st century, much like the invitations and visiting cards of the 18th century from the Sarah Sophia Banks collection, also in the Museum\u2019s collection.

Often mistaken for watercolours, they are in fact carefully constructed paper collages, or \u2018mosaicks\u2019 as she called them.\nSurprisingly, the story starts when the artist was 72, after she noticed the similarity between a geranium and a piece of red paper that was on her bedside table. The realisation prompted Delany to pick up a pair of scissors and imitate the petals in paper.\nMary Delany (left) and the Duchess of Portland (right).\nSo accurate was the finished result that when her friend Margaret Bentinck, Duchess of Portland, saw Delany\u2019s paper artwork, she mistook it for a real flower. This spurred Delany on to make more collage creations and hone her craft. In the autumn of 1772, she wrote to her niece, modestly stating:\nI have invented a new way of imitating flowers\nRosa Galicia, 1782.\nDelany\u2019s path to becoming an artist was not straightforward. Born in 1700 in the south west of England and brought up in a relatively well-off family, Delany was well educated and accomplished.\nHowever, her family pressed her into marrying elderly Cornish MP Alexander Pendarves when she was just 17, and after four unhappy years of marriage she was widowed. This gave Delany the opportunity to move to London and experience the artistic and social freedoms of court circles in the upper echelons of English society.\nPaeonia Tenuifolia, 1778.\nHer second marriage to Irish clergyman Dr Patrick Delany was more rewarding. During this time she developed skills in shell-work, fine needlework, plasterwork, drawing and painting \u2013 all fashionable pursuits at the time.\nWhen Patrick died in 1768, Delany spent half her time living with her friend the Duchess of Portland, a humanitarian and avid collector of natural history and antiques \u2013 including the Portland Vase. It was at the Duchess\u2019s home that Delany first used paper to model botanically accurate depictions of flowers.\nErythrina Fulgens, 1780.\nBy cutting minute pieces of paper and sticking them to a solid black background, Delany could build up each part of a specimen, sometimes using around 200 paper petals per flower.\nShe used smaller pieces layered over larger ones to create shading and depth, and sometimes enhanced parts with watercolours. The glue used to stick the pieces together was likely egg white or flour and water.\nHelianthus Annuus (Great Sun-flower), 1772\u20131782.\nEach piece includes the botanical and common names of the plants depicted, the date and place they were made and who donated the specimen. Delany\u2019s works also include her stylish monogram \u2013 \u2018MD\u2019 \u2013 rendered from cut paper. You can make it out in the corner of the image above.\nCyclamen Europaeum, 1777.\nFriends began sending Delany flowers and plants from around the world\nto imitate in paper, and botanist Joseph Banks sent flowers from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. Banks also frequented the Duchess of Portland\u2019s countryside home and saw Delany\u2019s works first hand.\nThe pieces were so accurate that he described the collages as the only imitations of nature he had seen from which one could \u2018describe botanically any plant without the least fear of committing an error\u2019.\nRhododendron Maximum, 1778.\nDelany made nearly a thousand of these incredible works of art and science before failing eyesight forced her to hang up her scissors in 1783 after ten years of dedication to her floral masterpieces.\nShe died on 15 April 1788, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy of drawings, embroideries, letters and exactly 985 cut paper flowers. It has been said that Delany\u2019s pioneering and inspirational floral mosaics were the precursor to the collage art form \u2013 later embraced by artists from Hannah H\u00f6ch to Man Ray.\nAloe Perfoliata, 1780.\nThe Flora Delanica, as the collection was called, was organised into ten albums and bequeathed to the British Museum by the artist\u2019s great-niece, Augusta Hall, in 1897. Try searching for your favourite plants and flowers in Delany\u2019s catalogue of works \u2013 you can browse them all on our Collection online (if you have the time!)\nCistus Formosus, 1778.\nThey have since become some of the most-visited works in the Department of Prints and Drawings (where they can be seen by appointment), regularly sought out by people wishing to enjoy these exquisite creations up close.

It was stolen not once, but twice!\nPainting of The Scream on display in the Munch Museum in Oslo.\nEdvard Munch, The Scream.\u00a0Tempera and oil on paper, 1910. CC BY 4 The Munch Museum.\nThe first time was in 1994, when the thieves broke in through a window and made off with a painting of The Scream from the National Gallery in Oslo. Luckily, it was found and returned within three months. Armed gunmen broke into the Munch Museum in 2004, stealing a different version of The Scream, and also the artist\u2019s Madonna. Both paintings remained missing until 2006, amid fears they may have been damaged in the process, and at worst, disposed of.\nEdvard Munch, Madonna. Lithograph, 1895/1902.

Ironically, the conservation process undertaken after the painting\u2019s safe return to the Munch Museum might not have pleased the artist too much\nPhoto of Munch outside with two paintings, 1909. CC BY 4 The Munch Museum.\nMunch would have probably seen any marks from this period of the painting\u2019s life as part of its artistic development. He wanted people to see how his works evolved and changed over their lifetime, and saw any damage they incurred along the way as a natural process, even leaving artworks unprotected outdoors and in his studio, stating \u2018it does them good to fend for themselves\u2019.\n5. This sketch of Despair from\u00a01892 came before The Scream, and perhaps\u00a0shows the moment of isolation Munch felt just before the \u2018scream ripped through nature\u2019\nEdvard Munch, sketch for Despair. Charcoal and oil, 1892. CC BY 4 The Munch Museum.\nMunch describes this experience: \u2018I paused feeling exhausted and leaned on the fence [\u2026] My friends walked on and I stood there trembling with anxiety\u2019. There are a number of other artworks that accompany it \u2013 The Scream is the best known work from a powerful series of images which Munch called The Frieze of Life, first exhibited in 1893.\n6.

Lithograph, 1895. CC BY 4 The Munch Museum.\nThe actual scream, Munch claims, came from the surroundings around the person. The artist printed \u2018I felt a large scream pass through nature\u2019 in German at the bottom of his 1895 piece. Munch\u2019s original name for the work was intended to be The Scream of Nature.\n7. It was not intended to be a representation of an individual scream\nDetail from Edvard Munch (1863\u20131944),The Scream. Lithograph, 1895. Private collection, Norway.

The figure appears featureless and un-gendered, so it is de-individualised \u2013 and is perhaps one of the reasons why it has become a universal symbol of anxiety.\n8.

This emergence allowed for the movement of goods, people and ideas over a huge area.\nWith the arrival of Islam, Mecca became the centre of the Islamic world, a place where everyone from Arabs and Persians to Ethiopians and Chinese met. At the same time, the rise and fall of different political powers gave fresh life to ancient cities such as Damascus in Syria \u2013 and created new cosmopolitan centres like Isfahan in Iran and Delhi in India.\nTile showing the Ka\u2019ba at Mecca. Iznik (Turkey), 17th\u201318th century.\nTrade played a major role in these connections. The great port city of Siraf, on the south coast of Iran, was a hub for merchants from across the Indian Ocean between the 8th and 10th centuries. Objects found at the site include Chinese porcelain, semi-precious stones from Madagascar, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka \u2013 and even a complete Indian cooking pot \u2013 showing the enormous geographic and economic reach of Islam, from a very early period.\nCooking pot. south Asia, 7th\u20139th century.\nScience and technology\nScientists made massive strides in medicine, mathematics and astronomy \u2013 making the Islamic world a centre of knowledge. In the gallery, we focus on astronomy, looking at the ways in which astronomers and astrologers studied and interpreted the stars. The astrolabe (a handheld map of the skies) could be used for everything from navigation to determining the direction of prayer, and could serve both practical and decorative purposes. An example made for the Iranian ruler Shah Sultan Husayn in 1712, from\u00a0 the Safavid dynasty, is a perfect example of both precise engineering and beautiful design.\nAstrolabe, Iran, 1712.\nAdvances in ceramics and glass included lustreware \u2013 the technique of decorating objects with bright metallic colours. First used on glass in Egypt, the technique was perfected by Iraqi potters in the 9th century. With the migration of craftsmen, it spread to Syria, Iran, Spain and eventually to Italy.\nLustreware bowl. Iraq, 9th century.\nPeople\nDuring the creation of the gallery, we meet the people who created the objects, those who used them and those who valued them. The specially designed space allows us to display light-sensitive materials like textiles and works on paper for the very first time. The textiles are rich in human stories, such as this pistachio-coloured dress from the region of Baluchistan (part of Pakistan), embroidered in contrasting red silk. The pocket at the front would once have been used for thread, medicine or other everyday items \u2013 although nowadays it would probably be used for keys, a mobile phone or credit cards!\nTextiles from South Asia on display in the gallery.\nCreating, making, playing\nShadow puppets. Turkey, 1970s.\nThe Islamic world has a rich history of storytelling. Originally inspired by performances in Egypt, shadow theatre has played an important role in the cultural traditions of Turkey since the early Ottoman period in the 16th century. A fabric screen illuminated from behind was the stage upon which a number of characters emerged to perform lively sketches and plays.\nThe plays themselves, part slapstick comedy, part serious dialogue, followed a set structure. At the same time they allowed the characters, particularly the principal two, Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat (above right), to comment on topics from the banalities of everyday life to more serious social and political matters (although topics such as the Sultan and religion were never discussed). The figures were made of coloured animal hide and were moved by means of sticks by a master puppeteer, sometimes with the help of an assistant. Performances occurred mainly during the evenings in Ramadan, or at weddings and circumcisions.\nIdris Khan in front of 21\u00a0Stones.\nAn entirely new aspect of this gallery is that it gave the British Museum the opportunity to commission its first site-specific artwork. Created by the British artist Idris Khan, 21 Stones evokes the jamarat (\u2018Stoning of the Devil\u2019) ritual which takes place during the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Each of the 21 pieces is unique, composed of the artist\u2019s poetry stamped in blue ink onto paper.\nAs Khan says, \u2018I have always imagined when a pilgrim releases a stone, and it hits the wall, the words, and prayers that the stone represents explodes into a physical language. The words themselves are a personal departure about me and my life to date and are mostly unreadable. For me, it is an abstract and meditative act. I do not want to be judged on the words that are used as I prefer the viewer to enjoy the image rather than try to understand its content.\u2019\nObjects showing the use of Arabesque designs in the gallery.\nWithin the gallery there is also a dedicated temporary display space, which will be used to showcase a regular series of free, temporary exhibitions. The first of these is a display of works from the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia (IAMM), based around the development and use of the Arabesque, a common design feature in Islamic art.\nDiscover the making of the gallery, the story of the collection and how these fascinating objects were conserved before display here.

When Bhringi attempted to circle around Shiva as part of his worship, Parvati sat on Shiva\u2019s lap to stress their unity.\nHadrian\u2019s heartbreak\nRelationships between men were part of ancient Greek and Roman culture, at all levels of society. But Hadrian\u2019s love for Antinous appears to have been especially deep. Antinous, the Roman emperor Hadrian\u2019s lover, drowned in the Nile while the imperial entourage was making a journey up the river in AD 130. By coincidence, Egyptians were commemorating the death, by drowning in the Nile, of the god Osiris on the same day.\nDevastated, Hadrian founded a new city, Antinoopolis, at the site of his death. Antinous was venerated as the god Osiris-Antinous, and Hadrian also commissioned buildings and sculpture connected with the worship of Osiris for his villa in Tivoli, near Rome.\n(Left) Bust of the emperor Hadrian. Marble sculpture. Rome, AD 125\u2013130.\n(Right) Bust of Antinous. Marble portrait head. Rome, AD 130\u2013140\nBoth of these marble busts were made in the second century AD and were found in Rome.

The metal studs were thought to repel harmful forces.\nThe \u2018Ladies of Llangollen\u2019\nIn 1778, Lady Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby fled Ireland together. Challenging the conventions of the time, they set up home in North Wales, where they lived together for 50 years. Eleanor kept a diary which describes the days spent with her \u2018beloved\u2019 Sarah. The ladies became minor celebrities, living the life of their choice in the Welsh landscape.\n\nChocolate cups and saucers. 1779-81 and 1790.\nThese chocolate-cups belonged to the pair, and were made in the late 18th century. The image on the front depicts the cottage of the \u2018Ladies of Llangollen\u2019.\nOne of the cups is part of the UK touring exhibition Desire, love, identity; exploring LGBTQ histories, currently at the Justice Museum in Nottingham.\nYoung lovers in China\nThe fictional tale of young lovers Cui Yingying and Zhang Sheng has frequently been depicted throughout history. The couple are characters in the play The Romance of the Western Chambers\u00ad \u2013 a comedy written by Wang Shifu during the Chinese Yuan dynasty (1279\u20131368) \u2013 who embark on a secret love affair without the consent of their parents.\nXu Yang. llustrations to Xixiang ji.

Above, on the right, you can see the young couple in the garden, while Cui Yingying\u2019s maid watches. Instead of exposing the lovers, the maid organises a secret union between them. The story ends on a positive note as the couple are \u2018officially\u2019 happily married.\nHome is where the heart is\nThis ornate locket is known as the Grenville Jewel. The locket was sent from a loving husband \u2013 Sir Bevil Grenville \u2013 to his wife Lady Grace Grenville while the English Civil War kept them apart.\nOval locket. Gold, containing miniature portrait in watercolour. England, c.1635\u20131640\nInside we find Bevil\u2019s portrait, showing him wearing a suit of armour \u2013 during the Civil War he served as a Royalist general. He sent the jewel to his wife some time between 1639 and 1643 while away from home.\nThe outside of the locket is decorated with enamelled pansies, which were associated with loving thoughts at the time. Diamonds, emeralds, opals, rubies and pearls adorn its glittering exterior.\nLet there be love\nIf bejewelled gifts between parted lovers isn\u2019t up your street, then this Maya stone lintel might be more your thing. It depicts a scene showing King Shield Jaguar II and his wife Lady Xoc.\nThe Yaxchilan Lintel 24. Carved limestone. Mexico, AD 723\u2013726.\nThe couple are seen engaged in a bloodletting rite.

Hugely powerful, Ashurbanipal ruled what was at the time the largest empire on earth but, within a few decades of his death, his empire had collapsed and his capital city burnt to the ground.\nGeorge Woolliscroft Rhead after Ford Madox Brown, The Dream of Sardanapalus, print, 1890.\nSince classical times, writers have speculated about the fall of Assyria. Greek and Roman sources talk of the extravagant suicide of its last king Sardanapalus (believed by some to be Ashurbanipal), surrounded by his gold and his concubines. The Old Testament recounts the city\u2019s annihilation by divine wrath and, from the Middle Ages, interest in biblical evidence motivated travellers and geographers to try and locate the city.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until the mid-19th century that the location of Nineveh \u2013 near Mosul in northern Iraq \u2013 was confirmed.\nNationalistic rivalries\nAt this time, the region of Mosul was part of the Ottoman Empire. France and Britain both had a consulate in Mosul and the imperial rivalry between both countries, as well as their political interest in the region, fuelled pioneering archaeological excavations.\nFrederick Charles Cooper, watercolour showing excavations at Nineveh. 1850.\nExcavations began in 1842 when the French consul, Paul \u00c9mile Botta, commissioned by the Louvre museum, began digging at the site of Khorsabad, where he discovered a city built by the Assyrian king Sargon II. The excavation findings were published under the title Monuments of Nineveh, as Botta wrongly believed that he had found the famed ancient city.\nThese discoveries captured the attention of Austen Henry Layard, a young British explorer who worked as assistant to the British ambassador in Constantinople. Layard persuaded the ambassador to personally fund excavations at the site of Nimrud. From 1845 Layard, with the invaluable help of Hormuzd Rassam, an archaeologist from Mosul, and his team began excavations at Nimrud. They soon unearthed monumental winged bulls and lions that used to flank the gates of an Assyrian palace.\nPossibly George Scharf (1820\u20131895), Layard and Rassam at work in Nimrud, c. 1850\u201360, hand-coloured lithograph on canvas.\nExcited by these finds, the British government, through the British Museum, took over as sponsor and in 1847 Layard moved to the mound of Kuyunjik, across the river Tigris in front of Mosul. It was there that he finally unearthed the fabled city of Nineveh.\nFrederick Charles Cooper. Drawing showing the winged bulls found by Layard at Nimrud. Watercolour on paper, mid 19th century.\nRassam continued to dig at Nineveh on behalf of the British Museum and in 1853 discovered the North Palace of Ashurbanipal, with its brilliantly carved sculptures.\nThe British Ambassador in Constantinople was keen to see Assyrian sculptures displayed in Britain and he obtained authorisation from the Ottoman government to export some of the finds to London, while other finds remained in situ in Iraq. The sculptures that arrived in Britain gave the British Museum a collection to rival that of the Louvre in France.\nPortrait of Sir Austen Henry Layard in Bakhtiari dress. Watercolour heightened with gold,\n1843.\nThe rivalry between the two imperial nations was even played out at a royal level. Queen Victoria ordered jewellery pieces inspired by the Assyrian reliefs for a state visit to the 1855 Exposition Universelle in Paris. A \u2018turquoise and brilliant Nineveh brooch\u2019 was made for the occasion and was probably offered to the French Empress Eugenie to highlight Britain\u2019s part in Assyria\u2019s \u2018rediscovery\u2019.\nThe Assyrian sensation in England\nAusten Henry Layard published his excavations in the two-volume book Nineveh and its Remains in 1849. By carefully highlighting the link between Nineveh and the Bible, and by setting the narrative within tales of adventure and exploration in the Middle East, the book was a best-seller in Victorian England. 20,000 copies were sold in the first four years. A shorter and cheaper version of the book was later produced for wider distribution.\nLayard\u2019s Nineveh,\u00a0abridged 1858, Murray\u2019s Reading for the Rail.\n\nThe success of Layard\u2019s book persuaded the British government to allocate funds for the shipment of the winged bulls and winged lions to London, which had been sitting in crates at the port of Basra, in southern Iraq. Their arrival and initial display in the entrance hall of the British Museum was widely publicised in the popular press, such as the Illustrated London News.\nThe arrival of the Assyrian sculptures at the British Museum, The Illustrated London News, 28 February 1852.\nThe excavation of these Assyrian cities revealed a completely new civilisation to 19th century audiences, and back in England, Layard and his associates gave popular public lectures on the Assyrian sculptures.\nGeorge Scharf, Self-portrait of George Scharf lecturing.\u00a0Graphite on paper, 1852.\nWhen the Great Exhibition in the Crystal Palace was moved to Sydenham Hill in 1854, it now included a Nineveh Court. It was composed of brightly painted casts of reliefs from Khorsabad, Nineveh and Nimrud. Although the directors of the Crystal Palace were not too enthusiastic about displaying Assyrian art, the Nineveh Court was met with awe by the general public.\nFacade of the Nineveh Court in the Crystal Palace, Sydenham Hill, London, about 1859.\n\u00a9 Historic England Archive\nArtistic popularity: Assyrian revival\nThe researches of Mr Layard have not only rendered Assyria an object of interest to professed antiquaries, but have actually brought it into fashion\u2026 Everyone knows the form of an Assyrian monarch\u2019s umbrella, and the fashion of the Royal crown of Nineveh is as familiar as the pattern of the last new Parisian bonnet.\nThe Times, 14 June 1853\nThe discoveries had a major impact on the arts in Britain. Artists and designers started to copy details from the Assyrian sculptures in search of inspiration and historical accuracy. Lord Byron\u2019s poem Sardanapalus, King of Assyria, written before the discoveries, was staged by Charles Kean in 1853. The sets and costumes were conscientiously taken from illustrations in Layard\u2019s publications.\nEug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798\u20131863),\u00a0Death of Sardanapalus. Oil on canvas, 1827.\nSeen as tangible evidence for the Old Testament, Assyrian motifs were also used to illustrate Biblical narratives. Arthur Murch, an artist who was living just across the road from the British Museum produced illustrations for a Bible, and was directly inspired by the displays at the Museum.\n\nArthur Murch,\u00a0The Flight of Adrammelech, in Dalziels\u2019 Bible Gallery.\u00a0Wood-print on paper, 1860.\nAssyrian sculptures also made their way to France in the Louvre, but it was only in England that the Assyrian style met great popularity. At the time, the British Museum was selling casts of the sculptures displayed in their galleries but they were restricted to Greco-Roman examples. Private companies quickly responded to the public demand for Assyrian memorabilia.\nGroup of Assyrian style porcelain objects by Copeland & Garrett. 1868-1893.\nJewellers produced pieces decorated with scenes and motifs taken from the Assyrian sculptures. Winged bulls and lions, lion hunts and winged genies proved the most popular.\nBracelet decorated with an Assyrian lion hunt scene by Backes & Strauss Ltd. Gold and enamel, 1872.\nIn 1872 George Smith\u2019s translation of the \u2018Flood tablet\u2019 (a tablet from the Library of Ashurbanipal, which told a story similar to the great flood story from the Bible) produced a new surge in Assyrian style productions. Jewellery in particular was popular and many beautifully enamelled gold pieces were produced.\n\nPortrait of Lady de Trafford in costume as Semiramis, Queen of Assyria. Photograph taken at the Devonshire House Fancy Dress Ball, 2 July 1897.\nAncient Assyrian designs were even used at the grandest Victorian parties. Fancy dress balls were fashionable in Victorian aristocratic circles. One of the most notorious ones was the Devonshire House ball in 1897 where the guests were expected to dress as historical portraits. Lady de Trafford proudly displayed a dress decorated with Assyrian motifs of blossoms and flower buds while embodying the Assyrian legendary queen Semiramis. Very little was known of Assyrian royal women dresses at the time and a character such as Semiramis was the opportunity to make the most of the costume maker\u2019s imagination.\nExcavations continued in Mesopotamia from the 19th century onwards, however, this widespread interest for Assyrian motifs in the arts only lasted for about a generation in Britain. At the beginning of the 20th century, Assyrian revival began to wane, probably partly eclipsed by the widely reported, sensational discovery of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb in 1922 by the English archaeologist Howard Carter.\nFind out more about perceptions of Assyria in art, culture and politics from the 19th century to the present day in a special symposium on Saturday 9 February.\nThere are just a few weeks left of the BP exhibition I am Ashurbanipal: king of the world, king of Assyria, which closes on 24 February \u2013 book your tickets and explore this lost empire today.\nSupported by BP\nLogistics partner IAG Cargo"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-british-museum-membercast-ashurbanipal/", "category": "Podcasts", "title": "The British Museum Membercast: Ashurbanipal", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2019-01-30 00:00:00", "text": "The British Museum Membercast is a monthly podcast made available to \u2018all studious and curious persons\u2019.

Originating in Japan, manga now has fans across the globe.\nManga is immersive storytelling through pictures, where images rule supreme. The Japanese characters for manga translate as \u2018pictures run riot\u2019 or \u2018pictures unbounded\u2019. There is less reliance on text, and narrative is created through expressive line drawing along with the visual development of individual characters. It is manga\u2019s visually immersive\u00a0quality that makes it so popular.\nHow did Manga develop?\nManga\u2019s roots are international and can be traced back as far as 1200 AD, but the form as we know it today first emerged from serialised cartoon strips in magazines and newspapers by the 1920s. The popularity of Manga developed throughout the 20th century and it now boasts a global reach. The manga phenomenon is still expanding and includes animation (known as anime in Japan), art, fashion, graffiti, as well as digital multimedia and gaming.\nRead our blog post to find out more about the history of Manga.\nHow popular is Manga?\nManga is a multi-billion-pound industry, super-fueled by its readers and viewers. It is immensely popular with people of every age in Japan and increasingly across the world. With hundreds of genres, from sports to love, and from horror to sexual identity, there is a manga for everyone.\nONE PIECE, by Oda Eiichiro, created from 1997 onwards, is the best-selling manga of all time. \u00a9 Eiichiro Oda/SHUEISHA.\nA particularly popular example of Manga is ONE PIECE, by Oda Eiichiro, which tells the adventures of a boy whose body has become rubberised after eating \u2018Gum-Gum fruit\u2019 and who travels the world on a pirate ship in search of priceless treasure, the legendary ONE PIECE. Created for the publisher Shueisha in 1997, it is still going strong and has filled 91 individual volumes (tank\u014dbon). ONE PIECE has over 440 million books in circulation worldwide, making it the best-selling manga of all time and earning a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.\nHow is manga related to anime?\nOriginally printed on paper in newspapers, then magazines, and single volume books, manga is now going digital and is available in many different formats \u2013 and almost all languages. If popular, a manga may become the basis for an anime series or film.\nGolden Kamuy, by Noda Satoru, created from 2014 onwards, is a hugely successful manga \u2013 and now a popular anime translated into English. \u00a9 Satoru Noda/SHUEISHA.\nGolden Kamuy is a relatively new manga that has published more than 9 million copies and is now a popular anime translated into English. Written by Noda Satoru, it is a dramatic action tale that takes place in the early 1900s on the northern island of Hokkaido. The hero, Sugimoto teams up with a local Ainu girl named Asirpa to attempt to find gold stolen from the indigenous Ainu community in a deadly race with the Imperial Japanese 7th Division Army and other assorted and often unsavory characters. Noda, a Hokkaido native himself, told me how he researched all aspects of the manga including eating the food portrayed. Both the manga and the anime are gripping, as well as beautiful and educational \u2013 you learn about Hokkaido and Ainu customs as you become absorbed in the story.\nHow do you read manga?\nManga is produced in many different formats, now including those made for mobile devices, which lets you adapt how you wish to read it (keitai manga). Traditionally, manga books are read from back to front and from the upper right corner to the lower left corner of a page. Formats include the simple four panel manga (yonkoma), mostly seen in newspapers or on mobile phones, magazine compendiums of serialised manga artists (sh\u016bkanshi, gekkanshi), and individual books of specific manga or authors (tank\u00f4bon). There are also fanzines or independently published and fan-created comics (d\u014djinshi).\nGiga town: album of manga symbols is based on the 12th-century Handscrolls of Frolicking Animals (Ch\u014dj\u016b giga) and helps you to understand the grammar and symbols in manga. \u00a9 Fumiyo Kono/Asahi Shimbun Publications Inc.\nThe brilliant manga artist Kono Fumiyo has recently published a book called Giga Town: album of manga symbols in order to help us understand the grammar and symbols embedded within manga. Drawing animals based on the 12th-century handscroll called Ch\u014dj\u016b giga emaki, Kono makes these manga symbols, called manpu, come alive. Here we see her heroine Mimi-chan, a young white rabbit, racing a turtle that could be straight out of Aesop\u2019s Fables. They help explain the meaning of the use of spirals in manga \u2013 namely to show something spinning, either movement or one\u2019s head through dizziness.\n\nBlue Giant Supreme, by Ishizuka Shinichi, created from 2016 onwards, tells the tale of an aspiring saxophonist and includes visualised musical expressions.\n\u00a9 SHINICHI ISHIZUKA/SHOGAKUKAN.INC.\nManga images are supplemented by sound effects that include onomatopoeia and imagined sounds (giseigo and gitaigo), which are important components of the Japanese language. These sounds are drawn into the composition, enhancing their effect by making them part of the image rather than resting the words on top of the image or in a bubble.\nBlue Giant Supreme, a compelling manga created by Ishizuka Shinichi, tells the tale of saxophonist Miyamoto Dai, who travels to Germany to pursue his dream of becoming one of the world\u2019s best jazz saxophonists. The music scenes show manga at its best \u2013 the reader can almost hear the sounds through the vertical tightly drawn lines and sound effect symbol (in katakana, a Japanese phonetic system) reading \u2018baaaaaaa\u2019.\nHow is manga produced?\n\nNakaguma Ichir\u00f4, the senior manga editor at Shogakukan, is seen here checking the manga offer before approving it for inclusion in Big Comic Original magazine.\nMany large publishers in Japan derive a significant portion of their profits from manga. It is big business, the turnover of the domestic manga industry in 2016 was approximately \u00a33 billion. Four of the top publishers who also control a large share of the manga market are Kodansha, Hakusensha, Shogakukan and Sh\u016beisha. They are constantly competing, publishing rival magazines and trying to keep popular manga artists. Editors are assigned by the publishing houses to specific manga artists and play a key role in developing manga stories in collaboration with the artists. They work closely with individual artists and often help with content as well as managing production schedules and overall formatting and conducting basic research for the artist on the theme or images depicted.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 manga?\nDifferent strands of manga have evolved for male and female audiences. Sh\u014dnen manga, aimed at young men, tends to focus on action and adventure whilst sh\u014djo manga is aimed at young women, and focuses on romance and relationships. However, there is increasing crossover in plot lines, subject matter and gender of protagonists. Sh\u014djo manga can includes stories of male homosexual relationships, known as \u2018boys love\u2019 or BL.\nHigashimura Akiko (b.1975), Princess Jellyfish (Kuragehime). 2008\u201317. \u00a9 Akiko Higashimura / Kodansha Ltd.\nHigashimura Akiko is a brilliant young\u00a0sh\u014djo\u00a0manga artist. Heavily influenced by\u00a0sh\u014djo manga\u00a0from the 1980s,\u00a0she is known for titles aimed at young women. They include the award-winning\u00a0Princess Jellyfish, which has been turned into an\u00a0anime\u00a0series and is currently being translated into English.\u00a0Princess Jellyfish\u00a0was published as a series by Kodansha as a result of demand from fans.\nPoe Clan, on the cover of flowers magazine, was created in July 2018 by Hagio Moto, who is a pioneer in sh\u014djo (female) manga. \u00a9 SHOGAKUKAN INC.\nHagio Moto is a pioneer in sh\u014djo manga \u2013 and a master of including emotional depth and sophistication in her story lines. Among her manga classics is the Poe Clan series that continues to thrill after 40 years.

When I co-created and designed it to become a sea of pink on the Washington Mall for the 2017 Women\u2019s March, I didn\u2019t anticipate how the Pussyhat itself would become an international icon of resistance\u2026 Or that it would take its place alongside so many important objects of protest in the British Museum.\nIn 2016 and 2017, I was recovering from an injury. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to physically attend the Women\u2019s March, but I was desperate to take part. Earlier that year, I learned to crochet and discovered a thriving community at The Little Knittery, a tiny yarn store in Los Angeles. It was here that I became friends with fellow knitter Krista Suh. We crafted and talked about politics, women\u2019s rights, and the upcoming march. A marcher and non-marcher came together. The idea of the Pussyhat was formed. And the first Pussyhat was knitted. Here\u2019s how the story unraveled\u2026\nThe idea\nMost marches are photographed from above\u2014 and we wanted to utilise that. We wanted to create a cohesive and distinct image so that the Women\u2019s March would be remembered and make an impact. The Pussyhat, like this one on display in the British Museum\u2019s exhibition, is shaped like an abstract pussycat, and was a play on Donald Trump\u2019s words, \u201cYou can do anything. You can grab \u2018em by the pussy.\u201d\nPussyhat worn by marchers for women\u2019s rights, and against the newly elected President Trump, in 2017.\nCreating the hat and wearing the hat were physical ways to refute this claim by re-taking ownership and declaring body autonomy. On a practical level, it provided the marchers with warmth, and it was also a way for the maker \u2013 as well as the person marching \u2013 to be physically represented at the march. There are always people who cannot join the demonstrations, who have to stay behind and support from afar.\nWe also provided an option and template for Pussyhat makers to include a note about a women\u2019s rights issue important to them.\nWhen I see images of the Women\u2019s Marches, I see all the marchers, all the people who support them, and their shared cause.\nThe hat\nThe hat had to be cheap and easy to make. Kat Coyle designed an incredibly simple pattern, which used inexpensive materials, and it was easily adaptable to other crafts and all levels of ability. It was essentially a rectangle, folded on its side, and stitched from the crease. When put on, the \u201cpussycat ears\u201d naturally peaked out. Wearing a hat with cat\u2019s ears is a playful statement on a historically taboo word and concept. Rooted in humour, the Pussyhat allows us to talk about serious topics because of its accessibility.\nA diagram of how to construct the Pussyhat, by Abira Ali (via Pussyhat Project).\nWe chose pink because it is the colour that society has traditionally assigned to females, and we wanted to reclaim a colour that is often perceived as feminine and soft, in a powerful statement.\nWe chose to create a sea of pink, with each individual choosing their own shade, yet being part of a collective. And it worked! Photos of the 2017 Women\u2019s March show a distinct sea of pink. People and news outlets immediately shared them online and the march, with all its shades of pink, made its powerful mark. Clearly, the image is a strong currency in our digital world and, when the image went digital, it rapidly became a universal symbol of protest, positive demonstration and accessible activism.\nView of the Women\u2019s March on Washington from the roof of the Voice of America building \u2013 January 21, 2017. Image: Brian Allen, Voice of America.\nThe platform\nDigital media provided the means to connect people, to create together and to discuss women\u2019s rights. It offered easy access to activism to a global community of like-minded people.\nWe harnessed the power of the established international knitting community, both online (on Ravelry, a hybrid of Facebook and Reddit for knitters) and at local yarn stores and knitting circles. We used social media to reach out to first-time knitters, as well as those who didn\u2019t consider themselves \u2018crafty\u2019. We encouraged people to share their takes on the pattern and directed them to our website, where they could find knit, crochet and sewing patterns, videos and translations.\nUsing the hashtag #pussyhat, makers and wearers of hats exchanged contact info and posted finished products and selfies at the march. People across the world took on Pussyhat Project as their own, forging relationships and exchanging ideas.\nOur website was intentionally very easy to navigate with a printable manifesto, patterns and note template. It listed local resources (175 partner yarn stores) which offered a place where people could give and receive hats, buy yarn, and host knit-alongs.\nPussyhat Project went viral not only because it was an image that people could share, but also because it was something we all could do. It crossed gender, race, age, class, geography, and the space between the physical and the digital. This combination of relating in digital and physical spaces mirrors how most of us live today.\nCrafting for good\nUsing everyday materials to create objects of protest is not new. Pussyhat Project is not the first craft-based protest project. Just in the history of the United States alone, women have used craft as a method of dissent starting with the American revolution. The use of harnessing digital media with craft at this scale allowed the idea of Pussyhat Project to spread and grow.\nEvery single person who participated in the project was a Pussyhat activist, able to represent and be represented. As a visual object, the Pussyhat gave a greater voice to those who believe in women\u2019s rights. It continues to do so: people are gearing up for the 2019 Women\u2019s Marches, knitting needles raring to go.\nCheck out our latest Instagram posts and see for yourself!\nTo find out more about the Pussyhat Project, visit their website, or check them out on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\nThe Pussyhat is one of many objects of protest in the Citi exhibition I object: Ian Hislop\u2019s search for dissent, which closes 20 January 2019.

It\u2019s a complex object made of many different materials, so it presented a unique challenge for our conservation teams. You can read more about the process in our Conservator\u2019s blog post.\nFrom the ancient to the modern\nThere\u2019s a 4,400-year span of history on display in The Asahi Shimbun Displays No man\u2019s land. The show features objects made around 2400 BC relating to the first recorded border dispute \u2013 between the city-states of Lagash and Umma (now both in modern-day Iraq). Also on display is contemporary photography of this area of the Middle East by German artist Ursula Schulz-Dornburg.\nThe Great Gold Buckle\nThis stunning Anglo-Saxon buckle was made in the early 7th century AD.\nAt 413 grammes it\u2019s quite weighty \u2013 roughly the same as a can of baked beans! It was found as part of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial in the east of England \u2013 one of the most important archaeological discoveries ever made. The intricate designs contain 13 creatures \u2013 can you spot them?\nCrosstown traffic\nIn the early 1880s, it took 394 trips by horse and cart over 97 days to transport the zoological specimens from Bloomsbury to their new home in South Kensington at the then new \u2018British Museum (Natural History)\u2019. You might know it better as the Natural History Museum \u2013 uncover the shared history of the nation\u2019s natural history collections here.\nA museum of the world, for the world\nOver the last 10 years, the Museum has opened 92 international touring exhibitions in 21 different countries. More than 10,000,000 people around the world have seen one of our touring shows \u2013 that\u2019s more than the population of London!\nSilky skills\nThis Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ink painting illustrates a story about the 8th-century Chinese painter Wu Daozi, who is said to have painted a dragon so realistic that it came to life the moment he completed it. It took three conservators 491 hours to remount this silk painting during recent conservation work in the Museum\u2019s Hirayama Studio.\nLeafing through the pages of history\nThere are 500 clay tablets on display in our current exhibition about King Ashurbanipal\u00a0of Assyria. Over 2,600 years ago, Ashurbanipal collected a library of 30,000 tablets inscribed with cuneiform script \u2013 an ancient type of writing made up of wedge-shaped marks. The tablets in the Library cover all kinds of topics, from magic to medicine, politics to palaces. You can find out more about the king\u2019s Library in this blog post.\nAwe-inspiring architecture\nThe Great Court forms a spectacular centrepiece to the Museum. At two acres, it\u2019s the largest covered square in Europe \u2013 bigger than a football (soccer) pitch. There are 3,312 uniquely shaped panels of glass in the roof, which stands 26.3 metres above the floor at its highest point.\nCan\u2019t get enough Museum trivia?

It shows how people have used their skills as painters, printmakers, jewellers, weavers and even brickmakers, to challenge, question and mock the status quo. A notable absence is the work of musicians and songwriters, whose work is less physically tangible, surviving only as recordings, which the Museum has never systematically collected. To make up for its physical absence we introduced, via two audio posts in the exhibition, examples of protest music from all over the world \u2013 and have included some more recent \u2018creatively disobedient\u2019 songs.\n\nScroll down to listen to some of these songs of protest, along with a few others you may already have on your playlists.\nWarning: this blog contains explicit content.\n1. Fortunate son,\u00a0Creedence Clearwater Revival, USA, 1969 \ud83d\udd0a\nTruong Hieu (b. 1939) in this painting depicts a mid-battle scene in the Vietnamese war.\n\u2018Some folks are born made to wave the flag / Ooh, they\u2019re red, white and blue / And when the band plays \u2018Hail to the chief\u2019 / Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord.\u2019\nMany countercultural bands in the USA recorded songs opposing the Vietnam War, from 1955-75, often on the grounds that most North Vietnamese people did not want their help and because they believed the war was unfounded, as the South Vietnamese government the USA was purportedly defending was, in fact, corrupt. The \u2018fortunate son\u2019 of this track\u2019s title was someone whose connections enabled them to avoid military service.\n2. The March of the Women,\u00a0Dame Ethel Smyth, UK, 1910 \ud83d\udd0a\nPenny of Edward VII defaced to promote the suffragette cause c.1913, in the Citi exhibition I Object. This bold criminal act was one of many that catapulted the movement for women\u2019s right to vote into the political limelight.\n\u2018Shout, shout, up with your song! / Cry with the wind, for the dawn is breaking / March, march, swing you along / Wide blows our banner, and hope is waking\u2019\nA composer of operas and symphonic works, Smyth wrote this rousing anthem for Emmeline Pankhurst\u2019s Women\u2019s Social and Political Union, which led militant action in pursuit of women\u2019s suffrage, and of which she was a member. It was performed everywhere, from the Royal Albert Hall to Holloway prison. There it was sung by inmates, including Smyth herself ( she was imprisoned after throwing a rock through the window of a Secretary of State who made a condescending remark about women), to lift their spirits.\n3. Strange Fruit, performed by Billie Holiday, USA, 1939 \ud83d\udd0a\n\u2018Southern trees bear strange fruit / Blood on the leaves and blood at the root / Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze / Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees\u2019\nThis haunting protest song began life as a poem, possibly written in response to a widely circulated photograph of the double-lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith in Marion, Indiana in 1930. Billie Holiday premiered the song at Caf\u00e9 Society in New York in 1939, where it proved shocking, even to its liberal clientele. As she later recounted, \u2018there wasn\u2019t even a patter of applause when I finished. Then a lone person began to clap nervously. Then suddenly everyone was clapping\u2019.\n4. Brat\u0159\u00ed\u010dku, zav\u00edrej vr\u00e1tka! (Little brother, close the gate), Karel Kryl, Czechoslovakia, 1969 \ud83d\udd0a\n\u2018Little brother, don\u2019t cry, they are not bogeymen / you\u2019re a big boy now, they are just soldiers / they came in square, iron caravans.\u2019\nPoet-songwriter Karel Kryl recorded this song in response to the 1968 suppression of the Prague Spring \u2013 a seven month period of liberalisation in Czechoslovakia in 1968. Sung in Czech, the words of the first verse sound angular and clunky, imitating the sound of the invading Soviet tanks. The song was banned shortly after it was released. Facing arrest, Kryl went into exile. He wouldn\u2019t return until after the Velvet Revolution in 1989, which returned democracy to the country after Nazi occupation and communist rule, without bloodshed.\n5. Zombie, Fela Kuti, Nigeria, 1976 \ud83d\udd0a\n\u2018Zombie no go go, unless you tell am to go (Zombie) / Zombie no go stop, unless you tell am to stop (Zombie) / Zombie no go turn, unless you tell am to turn (Zombie) / Zombie no go think, unless you tell am to think (Zombie)\u2019\nFela Kuti\u2019s opposition to Nigeria\u2019s military dictatorship came to a head with the release of his album Zombie in 1976, from which this is the title track. It is a metaphor for soldiers who unthinkingly follow orders. After the album\u2019s release, Kuti\u2019s compound was stormed and burned to the ground. The musician was severely beaten and his mother thrown from an upper floor window. She later died from her injuries.\n6. Jaane Waale Sipahi (To the departing soldier), Makhdoom Mohiuddin, India, 1940s \ud83d\udd0a\nAsk the departing soldier / Where he is headed, where is he going? / Who is that woman who cries / Soothing her hungry children? / Can you hear life cry out amidst the stench of burnt bodies? / Where are you headed, oh soldier?\nThis anti-war song was written during the Second World War by an Urdu poet and composer. It questioned why Indians should fight on behalf of their colonial oppressors.\n7. Boloko (Circumcision), Fatoumata Diawara, Mali, 2011 \ud83d\udd0a\n\u2018Don\u2019t cut the flower that makes me a woman / If you circumcise girls / You will make their intimate moments difficult / They will always have health problems / I beg you mother, don\u2019t make them circumcise me, it hurts so much!\u2019\nIn an appeal to end the widespread practice of female circumcision, the artist sings about her own experience of being cut as a child.\nThere are many more chart-topping musicians who capture the spirit of dissent \u2013 and continue to question authority in our challenging world. Even if freedom of speech isn\u2019t in question in their home country, the fact that they exercise this important right is something to celebrate.\n8. This Is America,\u00a0Childish Gambino, USA, 2018 \ud83d\udd0a\nA \u2018pussyhat\u2019 worn by marchers for women\u2019s rights, and against the newly elected President Trump, in 2017, as seen in the Citi exhibition I Object.\nSince its release, this song has amassed over 440,000,000 views on YouTube. Directed by Hiro Murai and choreographed by Sherrie Silver, the music video touches on gun violence, racial inequalities in America, and how entertainment has been historically used to distract us from current affairs. Gambino performed at the London-based festival Lovebox in July 2018 \u2013 during Trump\u2019s official visit to London \u2013\u00a0 and after referencing the infamous Trump baby blimp on stage, he closed the set with This is America.\n9. Fuck You,\u00a0Lily Allen, UK, 2009 \ud83d\udd0a\nAmerican banknote defaced with George W. Bush\u2019s face, also displayed in\nthe Citi exhibition I Object.\n\u2018So you say / It\u2019s not okay to be gay / Well, I think you\u2019re just evil / You\u2019re just some racist who can\u2019t tie my laces / Your point of view is medieval\u2019\nSung with a cherubic voice over a breezy melody, Lily Allen\u2019s anger at the often outdated views of elected representatives is brilliantly channelled in this modern pop classic. There are mixed opinions about who \u2018inspired\u2019 Fuck You, but Allen clarified at a concert in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil: \u2018It was originally written about this fucking arsehole who used to be the President of the United States of America. His name is George W. Bush.\u2019"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/who-was-edvard-munch/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Who was Edvard Munch?", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2019-01-08 00:00:00", "text": "Born in 1863 in Kristiania (modern day Oslo), Norway, Edvard Munch is one of the pioneers of modern art, best known for his arresting work, The Scream. Despite creating one of the most famous pieces of art in the world, surprisingly, the man behind the icon isn\u2019t as well known as contemporaries such as Vincent van Gogh, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec or Paul Gauguin.\nAhead of the largest exhibition of his prints to be shown in the UK for nearly 50 years, find out more about the life and works of this ground-breaking artist\u2026\nWho was the man behind The Scream?\nA non-conformist\nMunch pursued an unconventional lifestyle for his time \u2013 in his hometown of Kristiania, the Lutheran church controlled almost every aspect of life in a deeply conservative society. Munch longed to escape. He reacted against his strict upbringing, mixing instead with a group of bohemian writers and artists who sought to expose the anxiety and hypocrisy beneath society\u2019s ordered surface, including a fear of sexuality and its consequences. Munch formed passionate and tumultuous relationships, which provided artistic inspiration and an emotional intensity to his work that would shape his innovative prints.\nEdvard Munch (1863\u20131944), Vampire II. Colour lithograph and woodcut, 1895/1902. The Savings Bank Foundation DNB, on deposit at Henie Onstad Kunstsenter, H\u00f6vikodden, Norway.\nPainter or printmaker?\nDuring the first ten years of his career Munch concentrated on painting, which he is primarily known for today, before starting to produce innovative prints in around 1894. His remarkable colour lithographs and unusual \u2018jigsaw\u2019 style woodcuts, were quickly recognised by a sophisticated print collectors\u2019 market and effectively established his fame and international reputation as an artist.\nEdvard Munch (1863\u20131944), Head by Head. Colour woodcut, 1905. (CC) BY 4 The Munch Museum.\nA subversive bohemian\nMunch exchanged ideas with a radical group of bohemian writers, poets and artists in Kristiania, who openly criticised society and advocated free love. In his many visits to Paris and Berlin, Munch was attracted to similar companions, whose work pushed against the boundaries of art, literature and philosophy.\nEdvard Munch (1863\u20131944), Kristiania Bohemians II. Woodcut, 1895. (CC) BY 4 The Munch Museum.\nThe artist was also strongly influenced by theatre. \u00a0Munch felt a particular affinity with the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen\u2019s plays, which shocked bourgeois society with their uncompromising analysis of social and moral conventions by addressing adultery, hypocrisy, syphilis and madness \u2013 themes Munch also sought to represent.\nThe captivating allure of this red-haired figure conveys many of Munch\u2019s fears about the power of women. In real life, Munch\u2019s bohemian love affairs were frequent and beset with difficulty \u2013 he was attracted to women, but was unable to commit himself to anybody. Shockingly his affair with Tulla Larsen ended in a shooting incident which required surgery to remove a bullet from his finger!\nEdvard Munch, Woman with red hair and green eyes: Sin, colour lithograph, 1902. (CC) BY 4 The Munch Museum.\nA restless traveller\nBy the late 19th century the growing rail network made travel increasingly fast and efficient. As Europe continued to industrialise in the early 20th century, Munch took advantage of developments in technology to travel widely across Europe and immerse himself in the artistic and bohemian circles of both Paris and Berlin. This presented exciting new opportunities for Munch to immerse himself in the life and culture of these cities. Throughout his life, he left Norway to arrange exhibitions of his work and mix with an international circle of artists and intellectuals.\nEdvard Munch on the trunk in his studio, 1902. (CC) BY 4 The Munch Museum.\nA pioneer in the expression of the human experience\n\u2018For as long as I can remember I have suffered from a deep feeling of anxiety which I have tried to express in my art. Without this anxiety and illness I would have been like a ship without a rudder\u2019 Edvard Munch\nEdvard Munch, The Scream. Lithograph, 1895. Private collection, Norway. CC BY 4 The Munch Museum.\nFrom a young age Munch was preoccupied with death and suffering, following the death of his mother and sister as a child \u2013 an anxiety which plagued him throughout his life and shaped his work. His art showed the fragility and extremes of the human experience \u2013 escalating from love to loss and tenderness to jealousy.\nThese were themes that Munch would continually return to \u2013 he saw works on certain themes as his \u2018children\u2019 \u2013 and Munch revisited a series of haunting images about love, jealousy, anxiety and death, which he referred to as \u2018the frieze of life\u2019. The artworks were not originally conceived as a single body of work, but developed into one as Munch gradually expanded his ideas.\n\u2018The Frieze is intended as a poem about life, about love and about death.\u2019 Edvard Munch\nEdvard Munch (1863\u20131944), The Lonely Ones. Colour woodcut, 1899. (CC) BY 4 The Munch Museum.\nA radical artist\nThe raw emotion in Munch\u2019s prints reflect many of the anxieties and hotly debated issues of the time, but his art still resonates powerfully in today\u2019s world.\nMunch was stimulated by his encounters with Bohemian circles of artists and writers in Kristiania and Berlin. He defied convention, developing a new visual language that radically departed from the slick society portraits and grand Scandinavian landscapes that were in vogue.\n\u2018We want more than a mere photograph of nature. We do not want pretty pictures to be hung on drawing-room walls. We want to create, or at least lay the foundations of, an art that gives something to humanity. An art that arrests and engages. An art of one\u2019s innermost heart\u2019 \u00a0Edvard Munch\nFeeling the need to break with tradition and move away from beautifully dressed figures set in detailed interiors, he presented the world as he experienced it. Munch\u2019s prints reflect the tension generated by rapid urbanisation and the moral dilemmas of a changing world, as well as the scientific and medical advances that were being made. His use of rough texture, unusual colour combinations and controversial subject matter resonated with shifting attitudes \u2013 and mark him out as one of the first truly \u2018modern\u2019 artists.\nEdvard Munch\nEdvard Munch (1863\u20131944), Madonna.\u00a0Lithograph, 1895/1902.

The earliest depiction of a ruler hunting lions is found on a carved basalt monument that dates to before 3000 BC. It shows two bearded figures wearing diadems (a type of crown) who can be identified as \u2018priest-kings\u2019. One kills a lion with a spear and the other shoots at a lion with his bow and arrow. In Assyria, the lion hunt was an important symbol of royalty and the Assyrian royal seal showed a king slaying a rampant lion.\nClay sealing with stamp-seal impression showing an Assyrian king in combat with a lion.\nRepresenting the hunt\nRoyal lion hunts were depicted on the bronze bands that decorated monumental gates, stone obelisks that recorded the king\u2019s achievements and on the carved wall panels that adorned the interior rooms of Assyrian palaces.\nSome of the most spectacular depictions of the hunt were found in the palace of king Ashurnasirpal II (883\u2013859 BC) at the city of Nimrud (in the north of present-day Iraq). They show the king hunting lions and wild bulls from his chariot, followed by a ritual scene where the king poured an offering of wine over the dead animals. More than 200 years later, King Ashurbanipal revived the royal lion hunt and decorated his North Palace at the city of Nineveh (also in the north of present-day Iraq) with brilliantly carved reliefs that show his prowess as a brave hunter. \u201c\nWall panel relief depicting a lion hunt. The figure holding the bow maybe Ashurnasirpal II or his son Shalmaneser III. Assyrian, 875\u2013860BC.\nWarrior king\n\nAshurbanipal presented himself to the world as a heroic king, claiming that the gods had given him outstanding strength and virility. As part of his military training the young crown prince was taught to drive chariots, ride cavalry horses and develop skills such as archery. Unlike earlier Assyrian rulers, however, Ashurbanipal rarely, if ever, led his troops on campaign.\nWall panel relief depicting Ashurbanipal hunting a lion from his chariot. Assyrian, 645\u2013635BC.\nAshurbanipal instead proclaimed his prowess as a warrior on a series of carved alabaster panels from his North Palace, that show the king hunting lions. Here Ashurbanipal is portrayed as the complete action hero as he slays ferocious lions on horseback, on foot or from the back of a chariot using a variety of weapons. He wanted to show the gods and his subjects that he was a heroic warrior.\nRelief depicting Ashurbanipal hunting a lion. Assyrian, 645\u2013640 BC.\nCreatures of chaos\nAssyrian texts record how plagues of lions obstructed the roads, and harassed herdsmen and shepherds by attacking livestock in the plains. It was the king\u2019s duty to rid his land of dangerous wild animals. \u00a0 Ashurbanipal set out to the plains in his royal chariot to confront a fierce mountain breed of lions but was surrounded and attacked. Fulfilling his role as the heroic hunter, Ashurbanipal boasts how he scattered the pride and killed each lion with a single arrow to restore peace to the plains.\nIn the steppe, a widespread place, raging lions, a ferocious mountain breed, attacked me and surrounded the chariot, the vehicle of my royal majesty. By the command of the god Ashur and the goddess Ishtar, the great gods\u2026I scattered the pack of those lions.\nCopper alloy lion weight. Assyrian, 858\u2013824 BC.\nAs the divinely appointed protector of Assyria, it was the king\u2019s duty to maintain order in the world by defeating the forces of chaos, which included foreign enemies and dangerous wild animals such as the lion. Assyrians thought of their world as encompassing a civilised heartland, situated in Assyria\u2019s cities, which was surrounded by a hostile, untamed periphery. Wherever the king ruled, peace and prosperity abounded, whereas foreign lands were afflicted by chaos. By hunting lions, creatures of the untamed hinterland, Ashurbanipal showed how he could extend his control over the wilderness. Laden with ritual symbolism and heroic drama, the royal lion hunt was a particularly effective means of publicising the king\u2019s ability, as the shepherd of his people, to protect his flock.\nIvory lion\u2019s head carved in very high relief.

Oil on canvas, 1878.\nAlthough Ashurbanipal represented himself hunting animals in the wild, the hunting scenes that decorated Ashurbanipal\u2019s palace were staged events within the game parks of the city. These were public spectacles, comparable to Roman arena games. A scene from a wall panel shows a small boy releasing a lion from its cage, which had been captured for the purpose of the hunt. He is protected from the lion by a smaller cage.\nDetail of a relief showing a lion being released from a cage. Assyrian, 645\u2013640 BC.\nOn another panel the hunting arena is formed by a circle of guards carrying spears and shields, behind which is a row of archers.

Some carry skins, perhaps selling water to the crowds.\nDetails from a relief showing spectators watching the lion hunt from a hill. Assyrian, 645\u2013640 BC.\nThe lions themselves may well have been relatively tame. The Assyrians kept lions along with other animals such as deer and gazelle in their game parks and pleasure gardens. In a wall panel from Ashurbanipal\u2019s palace, a lioness and a lion with a magnificent mane relax in an idyllic garden and, in another scene (below), a seemingly tame lion walks alongside musicians.\nRelief depicting a harpist and lyre player with tame lion beneath palms and pine trees. Assyrian, 645\u2013640 BC.\nWhatever the reality of the hunt, Ashurbanipal was sure to claim a courageous victory! In one scene, an Assyrian horseman, guarded by spearmen in a chariot, distracts a crouching lion. Ashurbanipal (shown below) approaches from the left and grabs the lion by its tail, preparing to strike it over the head with a mace. The accompanying caption states:\nI, Ashurbanipal, king of the world, king of Assyria, while carrying out my princely sport, seized a lion that was born in the steppe by its tail and, through the command of the gods\u2026 shattered its skull with the mace that was in my hand.\nRelief depicting Ashurbanipal hunting a lion. Assyrian, 645\u2013640 BC.\nA political and religious message\nThis section from a larger wall panel shows the climax of a royal lion hunt. A lion has been mortally wounded by an arrow, which pierces its body just above the shoulder. It squats on its haunches, tensing every muscle in an attempt to stay upright as blood gushes from its mouth. Although the suffering of the lions is horrible to see, the artist has perfectly captured the animal in its death-throes, and we see a naturalism that is rarely encountered in Assyrian art. However, it is likely that the artist captured the lion\u2019s agony, not out of pity, but to symbolise the king\u2019s triumph over the dangerous and chaotic forces that the lion represented.\nDetail of a relief showing a dying lion. Assyrian, 645\u2013640 BC.\nThe king\u2019s power to defeat these enemies of civilisation was part of his divine prerogative and the hunt had a deep religious significance. On behalf of the gods, the king was cleansing the land of dangerous and chaotic forces. In this wall panel, Ashurbanipal can be seen pouring a wine offering to the warrior goddess Ishtar over the lions that he has slain. The inscription reads:\nI, Ashurbanipal, king of the world, king of Assyria, to whom the god Ashur and the goddess Ishtar have granted outstanding strength, set up the fierce bow of the goddess Ishtar \u2014 the lady of battle \u2014 over the lions that I had killed. I made an offering over them and poured a libation of wine over them.\n\n\nDetail of a relief showing Ashurbanipal pouring libations on the bodies of four lions.

Objects range from the 15th century to the present day, with works by painters such as Delacroix and Lewis alongside many examples of material culture \u2013 from costume books and decorative arts to video installation. The exhibition re-examines the idea of Orientalism, offering a fresh look at this cultural relationship.\nBook tickets\nSupported by Jack Ryan\nSponsored by Standard Chartered\nThe BP exhibition\nTroy: myth and reality\n21 November 2019 \u2013 8 March 2020\nThe Sainsbury Exhibition Gallery, Room 30\nBlack figure pot showing Achilles slaying the Amazon queen Penthesilea, c. 530\u2013525 BC.\nTread the line between myth and reality in our epic exhibition,\u00a0Troy. The ancient city of Troy holds an enduring place in our\u00a0imagination.\u00a0The\u00a0Trojan War\u00a0is central to Greek myth and inspired Homer\u2019s\u00a0Iliad\u00a0and\u00a0Odyssey,\u00a0as well as works by\u00a0Virgil\u00a0and Shakespeare \u2013 and still inspires artists\u00a0and writers\u00a0today.

Detail from Crime Wave. Postcard, 1982. Gifted to the British Museum by Jeremy Cooper.\nThis exhibition highlights the largely unexplored way in which artists have used postcards as an artform since the 1960s. Featuring some of the most well-known contemporary artists from this period \u2013 including Carl Andre, Rachel Whiteread, Joseph Beuys, Yoko Ono and Gilbert & George \u2013 the show will reveal how the limited form of the postcard has been embraced as a hugely versatile and often transgressive medium.\nRembrandt: thinking on paper\nUntil 4 August 2019\nPrints and Drawings, Room 90\n\nRembrandt van Rijn (1606\u20131669), Woman Sleeping. Brush and brown wash drawing, c. 1654.\nMarking the 350th anniversary of Rembrandt van Rijn\u2019s death, this exhibition presents rarely seen prints and drawings, offering a new view of this Old Master\u2019s technical and creative ingenuity. The British Museum has one of the greatest collections of the Dutch artist\u2019s works on paper and this exhibition of 70 works reveals the immediacy, ingenuity and personal nature of his prints and drawings.\nReimagining Captain Cook: Pacific perspectives\nUntil 4 August 2019\nAfrica, Oceania and the Americas, Room 91\nMichel Tuffery (b. 1966), Cookie in the Cook Islands. Acrylic painting on canvas, 2008. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\n250 years ago, James Cook left England on the first of three expeditions to the Pacific Ocean \u2013 a skillful navigator, his voyage accounts were widely read. Today, however, his legacy is debated both here and in the Pacific. This exhibition explores these perspectives and displays the work of contemporary Pacific artists alongside objects collected on the voyages themselves.\nSupported by Stephen and Julie Fitzgerald\nPlaying with money: currency and games\nUntil 29 September 2019\nCoins and Medals, Room 69a\nBarbie \u2018Shop With Me\u2019 toy cash register with toy credit card, made in China, 2003.\nThe 20th century witnessed the transformation of money from precious metals to paper currency, from credit cards to digital crypto-currencies. These changes are chronicled in the evolution of childhood games which, in turn, shape the way we think about the world. This exhibition will explore these connections, drawing on the Museum\u2019s rich collection of games, toys, gambling ephemera and money.\nPortrait of an artist: K\u00e4the Kollwitz\n12 September 2019 \u2013 12 January 2020\nPrints and Drawings, Room 90\nK\u00e4the Kollwitz (1867\u20131945), Selbstbildnis (Self-portrait).

Scroll down for a dozen delightful objects this December.\nSleigh bells\n\n18th-century pipe stand decorated with a winter scene from Delft in the Netherlands.\nThis intricately decorated sledge paints a charming scene of life in Delft, Holland, in the early-18th century, daintily adorned with people ice skating against a wintry backdrop of leaf-bare trees and snow-dusted buildings.\nThe ornament itself has been crafted from tin-glazed earthenware \u2013 a traditional product of Delft since the 17th century \u2013 also known as Dutch Delftware, and was probably originally intended as a pipe stand.\n\nSnowsuit\nChild\u2019s all-in-one made of caribou hide. Igloolik, Nanavut, northern Canada, 1986.\nThis child\u2019s snowsuit is designed to withstand the extreme climate of Igloolik Island (located in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut), where temperatures can drop well below -30\u00b0C. Made from caribou (reindeer) hide, snowsuits like this one are extremely durable and extraordinarily warm, keeping the wearer insulated (and particularly adorable)!\nSkating couple\n\nGlazed porcelain figurine of an ice-skating couple. Made in Ludwigsburg, c. 1765\u20131770.\nThis vibrant couple formed one of four groups modelled by sculptor and medallist JohannAdam Bauer (1743\u20131780) \u2013 each representing a season. This one represents winter \u2013 the \u2018Schlittschuhl\u00e4ufer Paar\u2019 (or skating couple), are shown fixing blades with leather straps and buckles to their shoes to form ice-skates. They were designed to be part of the decoration placed at the centre of a dessert table.\nThe Swimming Reindeer\n\nCarved mammoth tusk depicting \u2018The Swimming Reindeer\u2019. Made in Europe 13,500 years ago.\nThis sculpture shows a larger male reindeer following a smaller female. Both animals have antlers indicating the depiction must be an autumn-winter scene. With their heads back, noses up and legs stretched out, the reindeer appear to be swimming, as they do when on migration to their winter mating grounds. At the end of the last Ice Age, human hunters followed the reindeer on which they depended for food and materials. These journeys probably generated stories that might have been as magical as those of flying reindeer in modern times.\nThe Winter Solstice in ancient Greece\n\nTerracotta group of Poseidon or perhaps Zeus driving a four-horse chariot. Made in Puglia, Italy c. 300 BC\u2013200 BC.\nSolstice (from the Latin \u2018sol\u2019, or sun) celebrations honour the sun. The winter solstice and shortest day falls in December for the northern hemisphere. Ancient Greek calendars varied from city to city, but in some calendars, a month around the time of the winter solstice was named after Poseidon (god of the sea in Greek mythology). This is despite the fact that Greeks were least likely to sail during these winter months as celebrations would take place! Poseidon is seen here driving a four-horse chariot.\nPrints in the snow\n\nUtagawa Hiroshige (1797\u20131858), No 16 Kambara yoru no yuki (Night snow at Kambara). Japan, around 1833\u20131834.\nThis enchanting woodblock print is part of a series by Japanese artist Utagawa Hiroshige \u2013 the Fifty-three Stations of the Tokaido. The series was based on his travels along the Tokaido road and was published in the early 1830s. The road was one of the most important transport routes on the east coast of Japan during the Edo period (1603\u20131868). This night-time scene depicts the snowbound station of Kambara, but you may recognise this artwork already \u2013 it featured as the cover for rock band Weezer\u2019s 1996 album Pinkerton!\nHanukkah, the Festival of Lights\nBronze Hanukkah lamp made in the 18th century.\nThis year, Hanukkah (the Jewish Festival of Lights), took place between 2\u201310 December. Over the eight days of Hanukkah, a candle is lit in a special menorah (candelabra) called a \u2018hanukkiyah\u2019 each night. This example was probably made in the 18th century, and shows the eight candle holders \u2013 traditionally lit from left to right. You can see two menorahs on display at the Museum \u2013 located in\nRoom 46\n.\nThe snowman\nHorace Devitt Welsh (1888\u20131942), Snowman. Etching on paper, 1922.\nWhat\u2019s winter without a snowman? The above print was made by American printmaker Horace Devitt Welsh and shows two young children looking up at an impressively hefty snowman, wearing a top hat and with a pipe strategically placed in his mouth.\nA snowy Mount Kailash\nPainting of \u015aiva and P\u0101rvat\u012b on Mount Kailasa. India, Rajasthan School, c. 1800.\nMade around 1800, this vibrant painting depicts the Hindu god Shiva with his wife, the goddess Parvati. They sit at the summit of snow-covered\u00a0Mount Kailash,\u00a0their Himalayan abode. Shiva is shown sitting on a tiger skin, with a cobra round his neck. They are accompanied by their animal mounts or vahanas, a\u00a0bull and a tiger. Mount Kailash is also believed to be the home of the Buddha Chakrasamvara. Thousands of Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims visit the mountain every year, circling around it by foot.\nPolar bears and the Three Kings\n\nMedal designed by Fritz Christ of figures in the snow. Germany, around 1906.\nPictured above is a medal designed by German sculptor and medallist Fritz Christ\n,\nmade in 1906. On one side, a woman can be seen holding a snowball while leaning over a fully-dressed snowman on skis, holding an ice hockey stick and a hand warmer. On the reverse, a female figure is depicted seated on a polar bear (perhaps not a recommended mode of winter transport)!\nBelow is a coin also from Cologne, Germany, dating to around 1516. The coin in the image is a thaler\u00a0(a German silver coin), and bears an image of the biblical Three kings \u2013 or Three Wise Men \u2013 who visited Jesus after his birth, bringing gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. Cologne cathedral holds the relics of the Three Kings, transferred there in the Middle Ages, and became a major pilgrimage centre, with the Kings becoming patron saints of the city.\nCoin depicting the biblical Three kings, or Three Wise Men. Germany, around 1516.\nThe Museum makes for a great day out over the festive period\u00a0\u2013 you can check out what\u2019s on here, and our Christmas opening hours here."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/manga-a-brief-history-in-12-works/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Manga: a brief history in 12 works", "author": "Ry\u014dko Matsuba, Visiting Researcher and Alfred Haft, JTI Project Curator for Japanese Collections", "timestamp": "2018-12-05 00:00:00", "text": "Manga is a diverse and popular art form in which artists tell stories through pictures and words. Japanese manga artists find inspiration for their work in daily life, the world around them, and also in the ancient past. Many people are familiar with modern manga, but the art form \u2013 with its expressive lines and images \u2013 is much older than you might think. As the Citi exhibition Manga \u30de\u30f3\u30ac\u00a0 is announced, here is a brief history of Japanese manga in 12 works.\n1. The Tale of the Monkeys\nAround the year 1200 AD, a humorous, anonymous artist produced a set of painted handscrolls that show rabbits and monkeys bathing in a river, frogs and rabbits wrestling, and other scenes where animals behave like humans. Known as the Handscrolls of Frolicking Animals (Ch\u014dj\u016b giga), this work is considered by some to be the foundation of modern manga. The\u00a0Tale of the Monkeys made in the late 1500s follows on from this and shows monkeys acting out serious and comical human situations. It includes early examples of speech bubbles (fukidashi), and other techniques essential to modern manga\u00a0\u2013\u00a0figures appearing multiple times within a single illustration, a strong sense of visual progression, funny details within a larger scene, and the dominance of visual action over text.\n2. Sant\u014d Ky\u014dden, Small Change from a Gem-grinding Wheel\nBy the late 1700s, Japanese artists were combining pictures and words in comic illustrated novels (kiby\u014dshi) that commented on, and sometimes satirised, aspects of contemporary society. These novels were published in large numbers mainly for newly rich and literate urban audiences and show that from an early stage, Manga could be political.\n3. Hokusai manga\nThe word \u2018manga\u2019 (\u6f2b\u753b) has been used to describe various styles over the last two centuries. Artist Katsushika Hokusai (1760\u20131849), the designer of the famous print, The Great Wave, has become closely associated with it because he chose \u2018manga\u2019 for the title of a series of picture-books that he published starting in 1814, the\u00a0Hokusai manga. These books are collections of assorted sketches, not narratives telling a story, so we have to remember that while Hokusai brought the word manga to popular attention, he thought about it differently than we do today.\n4. Japan Punch\nIn 1858, after Japan opened its doors to international trade, a foreign settlement and new port were opened at Yokohama. The first newspapers printed in Japan were created there, including Japan Punch by Charles Wirgman. Published from 1862\u20131887, Japan Punch presented cartoons satirising local westerners and the difficulties they had in establishing commercial and diplomatic relations with the Japanese. The journal had a major influence on Japanese artists and writers who, at the time, were concerned about Japan\u2019s rapid modernisation, and established similar publications to satirise Japanese government policies.\n5.\u00a0Kawanabe Ky\u014dsai, stage curtain for the Shintomi Theatre\n\u00a9 The Tsubouchi Memorial Theatre Museum, Waseda University\nArtist Kawanabe Ky\u014dsai (1831\u20131889) painted this provocative and humorous stage curtain for the Shintomi Theater on 30 June 1880. That day, after consuming a few bottles of rice wine, Ky\u014dsai retreated to a studio and started painting. Four hours later he emerged with 17 meters of painted curtain, depicting the members of the acting company as various kinds of monsters. Ky\u014dsai\u2019s homage to the actors created a sensation. His spontaneous wit and expressive line stand at the root of modern manga.\n6. Topical Manga\u00a0(Jiji manga)\nHints of the development of the Japanese manga market appear in early photographs, such as photos of print shops taken around the late 1800s, and also in the appearance of new publications like\u00a0Topical Manga\u00a0(Jiji manga). Illustrator and commentator Kitazawa Rakuten (1876\u20131955) launched this humorous newspaper in 1902 as a Sunday supplement to\u00a0News of Current Affairs (Jiji shinp\u014d).\u00a0He modelled Jiji manga\u00a0on the Sunday comics sections of US newspapers.\n7.\u00a0Manga sugoroku\nManga as we know it today first emerged from an international background of serialised cartoon strips in magazines and newspapers in the 1920s. Okamoto Ippei (1886\u20131948) arranged for the syndication of US cartoons in Japan, such as George McManus\u2019 Bringing up Father and Bud Fisher\u2019s Mutt and Jeff. He also founded a school encouraging manga artists to work in their own individual styles.\u00a0Manga sugoroku is a board game that Okamoto Ippei designed in 1929 and shows the lifestyle choices available to the modern young woman.\n8. Red books (Akahon)\nIn the late 1940s, the post-war occupation of Japan by Allied forces introduced new forms of censorship. Japanese people also had little cash to spend, so a trend emerged in Osaka for printing cheap, long-format storybook manga called \u2018red books\u2019 (akahon), which were sold at roadside stalls. One outstandingly successful red book was\u00a0New Treasure Island\u00a0(Shin Takarajima),\u00a0produced in 1947 by the young Tezuka Osamu (1928\u20131989) and Sakai Shichima (1905\u20131969). The title rapidly sold 400,000 copies!\n9.\u00a0Garo\u00a0magazine\nIn the 1960s, Shirato Sanpei (b. 1932) was a key figure in the genre of \u2018dramatic pictures\u2019 (gekiga), and an innovator who helped to create the avant-garde manga magazine Garo, in which participating artists retained control over the editorial process. This policy coincided with alternative ideas current in the 1960s and early 1970s. Shirato\u2019s series Legends of Kamui (Kamuiden) chronicled various struggles against injustice and corruption, and became a classic of its genre.\n10. Hagio Moto,\u00a0The Poe Clan\n\u00a9SHOGAKUKAN.INC\nIn the 1970s, the long-established genre known as \u2018girls\u2019 manga\u2019 (sh\u014djo manga) saw new developments, such as stories that featured only boys, love between boys, and friendship approaching love. Representative of the period is\u00a0The Poe Clan (P\u014d no ichizoku),\u00a0published from 1972.\n11. Oda Eiichir\u014d, ONE PIECE\n\u00a9Eiichiro Oda/SHUEISHA\nThe golden age of manga arrived in the 1980s and 1990s, following Japan\u2019s economic boom. The peak came in 1995\u00a0\u2013 that year alone, 1.34 billion manga collections (tank\u014dbon) were published. Among the most successful recent manga is ONE PIECE, which has been running continuously since 1997. It tells the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body has become magically rubberised and who travels the world on a pirate ship in search of the priceless treasure called ONE PIECE.\n12.\u00a0K\u014dno Fumiyo, Gigatown\n\u00a9Fumiyo Kouno\uff0fAsahi Shimbun Publications Inc.\nSome modern manga artists have been making fresh connections between historical and contemporary manga. In her book Gigatown, K\u014dno Fumiyo borrows characters from the famous Frolicking Animals handscrolls (painted about AD 1200) to explain the signs and symbols that manga artists frequently use to suggest actions or emotions (manpu).\nEnter a vivid world where art and storytelling collide \u2013 brought to life like never before in this ground-breaking exhibition.\nThe Citi exhibition \u2018Manga \u30de\u30f3\u30ac\u2019 opens 23 May 2019.\nSupported by Citi\nLogistics partner IAG Cargo"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-british-museum-membercast-halloween/", "category": "Podcasts", "title": "The British Museum Membercast: Halloween", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2018-11-27 00:00:00", "text": "The British Museum Membercast is a monthly podcast made available to \u2018all studious and curious persons\u2019.

Scroll down to discover the 10 petrifying prints and disturbing drawings they found.\nWicked witches\nHans Baldung (called \u2018Grien\u2019, 1484/5\u20131545) Witches\u2019 Sabbath. Colour woodcut printed from two blocks: tone block orange-brown and grey, 1510.\nIn the late 15th and early 16th centuries, German audiences were captivated by the bestselling book Malleus maleficarum (The Witches\u2019 Hammer), first published in 1487. It contained vivid descriptions of witches\u2019 rituals and powers, and advocated for their extermination.\nThis striking image seized on this popular subject, showing witches preparing for a Sabbath (witches\u2019 meeting) with potions, smoke, various instruments of divination and an unholy offering on a platter. A witch can be seen riding a goat backwards overhead. Artist Hans Baldung made many representations of witches that explore the sinister connections between women, sexuality, and death.\nDoom and broom\nPieter Bruegel the Elder (c. 1525\u20131569) St James and the Magician Hermogenes. Engraving, 1565. The story of St James derives from the apocryphal Golden Legend.\nThis engraving is one of the earliest depictions of a witch on a broom (seen on the right, flying up through the chimney).\nHere Pieter Bruegel is referencing an earlier Netherlandish artist, Hieronymus Bosch (c. 1450\u20131516), best known for his paintings of devils as hybrids of animals, humans, and inanimate objects symbolising chaos and corruption. Bruegel designed this print to be sold on an open market, and his images are often more comical or gently satirical in tone.\nUnder a full moon\nFrans Francken II (1581\u20131642), Witches\u2019 Gathering. Pen and brown ink with blue-grey wash.\nLit by a ghostly full moon and the glimmer of candlelight, both witches and wizards are hard at work in this busy drawing, showing gatherings intent on different kinds of incantations. This wonderfully spooky and chaotic drawing was in fact carefully composed and, as it is not related to any known painting by the artist, was perhaps intended to be collected as a finished work.\nSome witches read grimoires (books of magic) and brew potions using ingredients such as skulls and dead babies. The nude figure at lower left rubs her body with \u2018flying salve\u2019 \u2013 a toxic and potentially hallucinogenic concoction reported by some to allow witches to fly. The figure on the broom disappearing up a chimney, and the other flying out the top, is borrowed from the Bruegel print above.\nSkull and crossbones\u00a0\u2620\ufe0f\nAnonymous, a skull surmounting two crossed bones, and surrounded by three flames. Woodcut with solid black stencilled background.\nThe skull is an instantly recognisable symbol of death. This woodcut, made in the 18th century, was intended to serve a particular function, possibly in funeral ceremonies. But a similar plaque hints at another function \u2013 this print might have been pasted on doors to warn others that someone in the house was suffering from the plague or other dangerous disease.\nPopular prints like this are very rare as they were made to be used, not collected. These prints were cheaply made \u2013 in this case, the black background was filled in by stencil, a time-saving alternative to cutting out the background from the block.\nThe Headless Horseman\nAnonymous illustrator, The New Casket. Published in London, 1832. The distinctive style of these examples suggests they\u2019re by the same artist who made regular contributions to the weekly journal.\n19th-century Britain saw a revival of interest in folklore and fairy-tales, providing rich subject matter for authors and illustrators. The Gothic genre of fiction gained in popularity at the same time.\nThese trends influenced ephemeral literature as seen in the Arm of the Devil\u00a0and the Headless Horseman\u00a0published in the weekly journal The New Casket\u00a0in 1832. The eerie and suspenseful subject matter was often set in earlier times and/or other countries, and offered an accessible format for supernatural tales. The stark images, sharp lines and intense contrasts of darkness and light in the wood engraved illustrations catch the eye, set the scene and encapsulate the stories.\nA friendly ghost?\nGeorge Cruikshank\u2019s 19th-century illustrations have a touch of the Tim Burton about them.\nGeorge Cruikshank\u2019s gathering of ghosts calls to mind the affectionate response to macabre subjects in modern works by Edward Gorey, Chris Riddell and Tim Burton. Cruikshank\u2019s comic illustrations make light of the home-made ghost, fashioned from a sheet and turnip, who stalks the churchyard with visible legs and shoes!\nAbove and below: George Cruikshank (1792\u20131878), Illustrations from George Cruikshank\u2019s Omnibus. Steel and wood engraved illustrations, 1842.\nCruikshank\u2019s series of Frights\u00a0make fun of irrational fears experienced in everyday life. Examples include the midnight noise on the stairs, which a terrified family convince themselves must be thieves, and the harmless cat which gains the proportions of a tiger in the imagination. Although lighthearted in tone, these prints can tell us about the fears and anxieties of the refined Victorian home.\nMemento mori\nLuigi Conconi (1852\u20131917), Ruit Hora (The moment rushes away). Etching with monotypic surface tone, c.1893\u20131896.\nThis macabre etching was originally intended to decorate the face of a clock. The result of a collaboration between a printmaker and a sculptor, the hands were intended to protrude through the small etched circle in the centre of the skull\u2019s nasal cavity. Although the clocks were never actually made, they were intended as a daily memento mori (literally, \u2018remember death\u2019 \u2013 a reminder of the fleeting nature of life).\nThe clock\u2019s outer perimeter is formed by a snake eating its own tail, or ouroborus, an ancient symbol of Egyptian origins. Originally signifying renewal it was later taken up by magical and alchemical traditions.\nVampires!\ud83e\udddb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udddb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nEdvard Munch (1863\u20131944), Vampyr II.

Texts were written by pressing a reed pen into soft clay. The characteristic wedge-shaped strokes give the writing its modern name (cuneiform means simply \u2018wedge-shaped\u2019).\nThe tablets were discovered in the ruins of the city of Nineveh (now northern Iraq), once capital of the mighty Assyrian empire, ruled by Ashurbanipal from 669\u2013c. 631 BC. They were excavated in a series of digs from the 1840s through to the 1930s, and form the remains of the Assyrian royal collections of scholarly literature and archives.\nNineveh was consumed by fire in around 612 BC. But while paper books are destroyed by fire, the clay tablets were in most cases baked harder, making them among the best preserved documents from thousands of years of Mesopotamian history.\nSome of the tablets from the Library of Ashurbanipal on display in Room 55.\nWhen was the Library found?\nThe first big discovery of Library tablets was made by the English explorer Austen Henry Layard in 1850. He relayed the exciting news given to him by his foreman Toma Shishman on his return from the desert:\nThe chambers I am describing appear to have been a depository for such documents [historical records and public documents]. To the height of a foot or more from the floor they were entirely filled with them; some entire, but the greater part broken into fragments.\nLayard\u2019s Iraqi assistant, Hormuzd Rassam, continued excavations and in 1852 he discovered a second palace, and in it another large collection of tablets.\nWatercolour depicting Layard\u2019s team excavating at Nineveh\nWhy is the Library important?\nBefore the discovery of the Library, almost everything we knew about ancient Assyria came from stories in the Bible or classical historians. With the discovery of the Library, thousands of cuneiform texts were recovered, telling the Assyrians\u2019 story in their own words. From these we can follow court intrigues, listen in on secret intelligence reports, follow rituals step-by-step, hear the words of hymns and prayers, and thumb through medical handbooks, as well as reading in incredible detail about the deeds of the kings.\nThe Library was also famous in antiquity \u2013 centuries after Ashurbanipal\u2019s death (and Assyria\u2019s destruction), scribes in Babylonia celebrated the compilation of the Library. Perhaps these stories inspired the great libraries of the Greek world \u2013 such as the great Library of Alexandria in Egypt.\nWhile many tablets have been found at other sites over the last 170 years, Ashurbanipal\u2019s tablets remain our primary source for most of what we know about Mesopotamian scholarship of the time.\nCopy of a reply to Ashurbanipal\u2019s demand for tablets, written centuries after the Library was destroyed.\nWhy did Ashurbanipal collect tablets?\nAshurbanipal was an extraordinary king. In his inscriptions he boasts about the breadth and depth of his learning. While other Assyrian kings led the army on far-flung campaigns, Ashurbanipal stayed at home. The walls of Ashurbanipal\u2019s palaces were decorated with carved reliefs, including many of the King depicted with a writing stylus tucked into his belt.\nRelief depicting Ashurbanipal fighting a lion with a stylus tucked into his belt. 645 BC \u2013 635 BC.\nAshurbanipal\u2019s father wanted the young prince to be educated because this would give him direct access to the expertise he relied on to run the empire. Assyrian scholarship was focused on understanding the will of the gods, so his Library focused on texts that interpreted omens from the gods. However, Ashurbanipal had an interest in literary books as well. Ashurbanipal still kept tablets he had written during his training, presumably for sentimental reasons. Many of the tablets in his collection bear a \u2018library stamp\u2019 of sorts\u2014stating that they belong to his palace.\nA scribal note recording that the tablet belonged to the collection of \u2018Ashurbanipal, King of the World, King of Assyria\u2019.\nA flood of interest\nThe arrival of Assyrian objects in the UK caused a sensation. One person swept up in \u2018Assyromania\u2019 was a young banknote engraver called George Smith. He visited the British Museum in his lunch breaks, and studied every book available on the subject of Assyria. In 1861 the Museum gave him a dream job. He was asked to bring order to the tablet collection and to re-join the fragments of the tablets. While sorting the fragments, he made an astonishing discovery \u2013 a story about a great flood just like the biblical story of Noah. Smith gave a public lecture on the subject, which even the Prime Minister, William Gladstone, attended.\nThe Daily Telegraph duly sponsored Smith to find the missing piece of his flood story in the ruins of Nineveh. Amazingly, he found a fragment that helped fill the gap, although it was actually from an even older version of the flood story.\nGeorge Smith (1840\u20131876), and the tablet he pieced together to reveal the story of the flood.\nThe present and future of the Library\nLibrary tablets have been on display in the British Museum since their discovery. Today, you can see a selection of tablets on permanent display in Room 55 (the Later Mesopotamia Gallery), and remotely on Google Street View. A major display dedicated to the Library forms part of the BP exhibition\u00a0I am Ashurbanipal: king of the world, king of Assyria.\nWhile we know a lot about some of the books from the Library, we know far less about the Library itself. The tablets were not found in place, so we know little about their storage. And although a lot of progress has been made in re-joining the broken fragments, it is not clear how many tablets Ashurbanipal once had. We don\u2019t know how many scribes produced its books either. New research at the British Museum is working to shed some light on key questions about the Library.\nIn 2012, Ali Yassin Al-Jaboori began excavations at Nineveh on behalf of the University of Mosul, in search of more of the Library. Although interrupted by the security situation in 2014, it is hoped that excavations may resume within the next few years.\nWant to know more?\nWant to read the Library of Ashurbanipal?\u00a0Thousands of texts are available in English translations at the Oracc portal (see the SAAo, RINAP, CMAwRo, DCCLT, CCPo projects). There you can also find Knowledge and Power in the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which offers an overview of Assyrian scribes and scholarship. A new project bringing together these and other translations of Library tablets, and giving information about the Library, will be launched at the Oracc portal this summer.\nTablets from Ashurbanipal\u2019s Library on display in our current exhibition.\nYou can discover more about Ashurbanipal and his Library in the BP exhibition I am Ashurbanipal: king of the world, king of Assyria, which is at the Museum from 8 November 2018 \u2013 24 February 2019.\nSupported by BP\nLogistics partner IAG Cargo"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/a-journey-through-the-islamic-world-in-eight-objects/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "A journey through the Islamic world in eight objects", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2018-10-18 00:00:00", "text": "This beautiful new space explores the cultural significance, breadth and impact of the Islamic world, from the 7th century to the present day and from West Africa to Southeast Asia.

Mughal style, India, 1564\u20131579.\nThe Hamzanama, or Adventures of Hamza, is an epic romance about the legendary adventures of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s uncle, Amir Hamza. The Mughal emperor Akbar (r. 1556\u20131605) enjoyed reciting and listening to its tales so much that he commissioned an illustrated version in Persian, the language of the court. Taking 15 years to complete, the final work encompassed 14 volumes with 1,400 paintings by Indian and Iranian artists \u2013 less than 150 of which survive today. In this painting, the Old Testament prophet Ilyas (also known as Elias or Elijah) saves Prince Nur al-Dahr (Arabic for \u2018Light of the Age\u2019), the drowning grandson of Hamza.\nAstrolabe\nAstrolabe, made of brass inlaid with silver and copper. Probably southeast Turkey, northern Iraq or Syria, AD 1240/1.\nKnowledge of the stars, now called astronomy and astrology, was an important element of Islamic culture. From the 8th century onwards, scientists and thinkers used instruments like this to gather information relating to timekeeping and the positions of the sun, stars and planets.\nAstrolabes (the name derives from the Greek astro labos, or \u2018star-taker\u2019), were the computers of their time. This example is particularly large (46 cm high) and is exquisitely inlaid with silver and copper. It might have been a presentation piece rather than a functional device. It is signed \u2018Abd al-Karim al-Asturlabi\u2019 (the Astrolabist), and bears the names of three royal patrons, making it an important documentary object for medieval science and patronage.\nIn the 10th century, one astronomer estimated that there were around 1,000 possible applications for an astrolabe, ranging from the position of the stars to the direction of Mecca!\nIznik basin\nOttoman dynasty \u0130znik basin made of painted and glazed stonepaste. \u0130znik, Turkey, 1545\u20131550.\nThis intricately decorated bowl was made in Iznik, a town south east of Istanbul and the major centre of ceramic production during the Ottoman era. Between the 1480s and about 1700, a huge range of high-quality wares were produced that were inspired by imported Chinese porcelain, which was favoured by the sultans.\nThis bowl may have been used for ablutions (a ceremonial act of washing) by the sultan or his entourage. It is decorated with lotuses, saz leaves, tulips and prunus stems amongst other flora \u2013 the style and colour scheme of this bowl, with its delicate turquoise and green, are typical of Iznik pottery from this period.\nStar and cross tiles\nStar tiles made of painted stonepaste with an opaque glaze. Iran, probably Kashan, AD 1266\u201367.\nThese brilliant tiles are believed to belong to a group from the interior of the a Shi\u2018a shrine in Damghan, Iran. Persian verses from the Shahnama (Book of Kings), the Iranian epic, frame the star tiles and link them to the rich oral and literary traditions inherited from pre-Islamic Iran.\nTiles with verses from the Shahnama were also found in royal residences during this period, such as at the summer palace of the Mongol Ilkhanid ruler Abaqa Khan, at Takht-i Sulayman in northwestern Iran.\n\nUzbek woman\u2019s ikat coat with Russian lining\nUzbek woman\u2019s ikat coat made of cotton and silk. Uzbekistan, 1870s\u20131920s.\nUzbekistan was a centre for the textile industry in the 19th century. Dyed and woven silks, called abr, were produced in numerous specialised workshops. Silk robes were status symbols and worn in layers to flaunt wealth \u2013 a woman would have worn this robe (munisak) over a dress and trousers during important rites of passage, including weddings and funerals. The robe is woven with stylised rams\u2019 horns and pomegranate flowers \u2013 symbols of strength, abundance and fertility.\nBy the 1870s, machine-printed cottons from Tsarist Russia, like the brilliant red lining in this coat, had flooded the bazaars and supplanted locally woven, block-printed varieties.\nEnamelled\u00a0glass mosque lamp\nGilded and enamelled glass lamp. Egypt or Syria, 1330\u20131345.\nThis wonderfully intricate 14th-century gilded and enamelled glass lamp is one of a pair. Lamps like this would have been suspended with chains inside a mosque or shrine. A narrow tube inside the base contains oil and a floating wick. The inscription at the mouth of the lamp comes from the \u2018Light verse\u2019 from the Qur\u2019an (24:35):\nGod is the light of the heavens and the earth, the likeness of His light is as a wick-holder [wherein is a light (the light in a glass, the glass as it were a glittering star)].\nSudanese lyre (tanbura)\nSudanese lyre made of wood, skin, glass, cowrie shells, metal and animal gut. Sudan, late 1800s.\nLyres are stringed instruments that are played in many different cultures. This example from Sudan is a remarkable item as a whole, but if you look closer, you can see it\u2019s decorated with hundreds of smaller objects \u2013 strings of coins, beads, shells and other miscellaneous items from different places. The coins were mostly minted in Cairo and Istanbul in the second half of the 19th century, showing the long-standing links between the Ottomans, Egyptians and regions further south along the Nile. The multicoloured beads were used by Europeans as a medium of trade throughout the continent, mass-produced first in Venice and later in France and England. Lyres like this one are still played during zar ceremonies to this day (zar is a belief in the power of spirits and their ability to possess people).\nStone inscription of early kufic script\nEarly kufic script inscribed on marble. Egypt, AD 967. Top (front), bottom (back)\nThis marble panel originally formed part of a monument but was subsequently re-carved on the back. The front, which was probably carved in the 9th century, has the beginning of the Islamic phrase basmala, \u2018In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.\u2019\nThe text is in angular kufic script (one of the earliest forms of Arabic script) \u2013 you can see that some of the letters terminate in elegant leaf forms. The back has been turned into a funerary inscription and has been written in a simpler form of kufic script, reading:\nIn the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate, this is the tomb of Muhammad ibn Fatik Ashmuni who died in the month of Jumada II in the year 356 (AD 967).

Ashurbanipal\u2019s capital at Nineveh was a vast metropolis and the palaces were a symbol of the King\u2019s wealth and power. However, it wasn\u2019t just the architecture that made the royal residences impressive. Surrounding the palaces were orchards, game parks and lush and exotic gardens that evoked a paradise on earth.\nRelief depicting a harpist and lyre player with tame lion beneath palms and pine trees. 645\u2013640 BC.\u00a0North Palace, Nineveh, Iraq.\nThe Assyrian kings boasted in inscriptions about collecting plants and animals from across the empire for the gardens. Orchards were planted with a plethora of plants, alongside\u00a0pomegranate, pear, fig and olive trees. In creating these idyllic settings, rulers demonstrated their ability to bring abundance and harmony to the world.\nAshurbanipal claimed:\nI planted alongside the palace a botanical garden, which has all types of trees and every fruit and vegetable.\nA\u00a0feat of engineering\nThe gardens at Nineveh were irrigated by an immense canal network built by Ashurbanipal\u2019s grandfather, Sennacherib. He brought water to the city over a great distance using channels and aqueducts to create a year-round oasis of all types of flora.\nThe canals stretched over 50km into the mountains, and Sennacherib boasted about the engineering technology he used. A monumental aqueduct crossing the valley at Jewan, which you can still see the remains of today, was made of over 2 million stones and waterproof cement. The aqueduct was constructed over 500 years before the Romans started building their aqueducts, and was inscribed with the following words:\nSennacherib king of the world king of Assyria. Over a great distance I had a watercourse directed to the environs of Nineveh, joining together the waters\u2026 Over steep-sided valleys I spanned an aqueduct of white limestone blocks, I made those waters flow over it.\nA scene from a palace relief shows aqueducts in lush parkland near the city.

On this relief, a lioness and lion with a magnificent mane relax in an idyllic garden. For the Assyrians, lions represented all that was dangerous in the world, so the placid lions on this relief may demonstrate the kings\u2019 abilities to control the wild forces of nature.\nLions were also hunted in the royal game parks. Assyrian kings proved they were worthy of protecting the empire by killing these fearsome beasts as part of drama-filled public spectacles. The Assyrian lion hunt is famously represented in the reliefs from King Ashurbanipal\u2019s palace.\nCarved panel depicting a lion and lioness relaxing in a lush garden setting. 645\u2013640 BC.

They claim that later writers had confused Nineveh and Babylon, which may help to explain why excavations at the site of Babylon have never yielded any evidence of raised architectural gardens there. Drawings of a now lost relief from Nineveh show trees growing on a roofed colonnade, similar to those described in classical accounts of the Hanging Gardens. Even if it isn\u2019t the case that the Hanging Gardens were those at Nineveh, they may have inspired later gardens at Babylon and elsewhere.\nDrawing of a now lost relief depicting gardens.

It was a beautifully decorative ensemble of finely crafted materials, including metal, lacquer, textile, leather and horn. Each of these presented different challenges for the team of conservators at the British Museum.\nThe samurai armour required extensive conservation and mounting before it could be put on display. This is because it had been privately owned with no known previous conservation records. After initial assessments it was clear that it was covered in dirt dust, had damage to the lacquer, degrading textiles, and needed structural support for mounting. During its 250+ hour treatment we learned a lot about the techniques used to create the armour, with some interesting surprises along the way!\nSamurai armour photographed before it underwent the conservation process.\u00a0The crest of a dancing crane seen in several places on the armour is that of the Mori family of samurai lords who ruled the Ak\u014d and Mikazuki domains in Harima Province (modern Hy\u014dgo prefecture) in Western Japan.\nWhen the object arrived at the Museum it was quarantined for several months to ensure that no pests or infestations were present. Usually objects will be frozen to kill any insects, but due to the amount of lacquer and metal (which can break when quickly expanding or contracting due to changes in temperature), quarantine was the best option. Many of the wood and horn pieces from the armour and its storage box showed signs of damage by pests. \u00a0While wood damage can be seen as unsightly, interestingly some horn damage can be seen as a sign of affluence\u2014that the owner was able to afford real horn as opposed to a substitute.\nThis horn toggle was eaten by pest and this has weakened the toggle considerably.\nOne of the first things we did was clean the armour. There was a lot of dust in crevices that could scratch the surface when trying to spruce up the metal. We used a soft brush and a special Museum vacuum to carefully clean the dust off.\nTania performing a surface clean of the helmet to remove unwanted dust with a brush and museum vacuum.\nDuring a surface clean conservators can uncover partially obscured surfaces, helping us gain a better idea of the object\u2019s overall condition. For example, while cleaning the cuirass over 100 insect casings were found hidden beneath the silk cording.\nInsect casing was found behind cord while cleaning the armour.\nThe armour has several textile elements including the collar, shin guards, silk cords, tassels and sleeves \u2013 many of which had degraded over time and from light damage. Light damage fades dyes, and weakens the fibres causing them to split and disintegrate into fibre dust. The parts dyed a light orange/pink colour were especially damaged so our senior textile conservators set to work securing the loose fibres by using very fine silk thread and custom-dyed nylon netting where the armour needed additional support.\nThe collar before conservation with damaged textile showing the metal underneath. Senior textile conservator Anna Harrison had started to insert dyed fabric to secure the loose metal and place netting over the collar.\nHere the collar is now stable and only needs stitching around the edges to finish the treatment. The netting placed on top is now nearly invisible to the naked eye.\nOur main concern was the lacquer covering nearly all of the armour. When lacquer is new it\u2019s glossy with a smooth, shiny surface that is resistant to most environmental conditions. But over time light can damage lacquer and create tiny microcracks in the surface, making the surface appear dull. The armour had many areas with cracks that needed treatment to protect the exposed areas and prevent any more damage.\nBecause the adhesive we use dries very slowly (it takes over five days), it is important that any area we are trying to stabilise has continuous pressure. For this, we use a modified Japanese method called shimbari \u2013\u00a0it utilises a wooden frame and flexible bamboo sticks that allow the conservator to apply even pressure across an entire surface, whether flat or curved, over a long period of time. Coupled with clamps, we were able to re-secure lacquer that no longer lay down flat.\n(Left) The end of banner that shows chips in lacquer and some raised edges that need to be flattened.\n(Right) Use of the shimbari technique by UCL conservation intern Netanya Schiff on the banner to keep continuous pressure on areas being treated.\nConservation also requires research and analysis of an object to make sure its components are properly supported and treated. We knew some of the lacquered plates had a metal interior (easily found out by placing a magnet near them), but we were unsure of how many might be rawhide (stiff leather). With the help of the Science department we X-rayed the armour to see the hidden material underneath the lacquer. It was amazing to see the attention to detail revealed by the X-ray. The use of rawhide and metal changed depending on the amount of strength or flexibility needed in a particular area.\nX-ray showing side of cuirass (breastplate and backplate). The bottom is made from smaller pieces of rawhide (stiff leather) on the sides and attached with small nails. The X-ray also shows which plates are metal (seen as white) and rawhide (seen as grey).\nAfter the conservation was complete, the next challenge was to mount the object for not only the gallery, but for its permanent storage. As the armour had so many parts, it was necessary to create a strong mount. This involved using the traditional wood frame on which the armour was previously mounted, padding it out with dense blocks of wadding covered in jersey and silk for support. Individual pads were made to help add shape and protect places where the armour might scratch other pieces.\nSenior Textiles Conservator Katy Smith adjusting pads for the heavy lacquered skirt.\nWe realised that the previous mounting had allowed for too much space between the pieces \u2013the armour looked as if it had a very long torso and shorter bottom half. After finishing with the new mount, it became clear that the armour pieces should be fitted closely together.\nThe finished article on display.\nAfter nearly eight months of painstaking conservation and over 250+ hours of work, you can now see this newly acquired samurai armour in all its conserved glory!"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-british-museum-membercast-i-object/", "category": "Podcasts", "title": "The British Museum Membercast: I object", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2018-09-25 00:00:00", "text": "This month Iszi presents Ian Hislop\u2019s discussion with Philip Attwood, Keeper of Coins and Medals at the British Museum, on the history of protest and poking fun at authority.

I\u2019m pleased to say that the answer was \u2018yes\u2019\u2026\nSaucy stoneware\nEgyptian limestone ostracon, usually used as a writing surface, here depicting a sex scene.\nI was taken by my parents to see the great Tutankhamun exhibition at the British Museum, and I was hugely impressed with the tragic dynastic glamour of the royal tomb. Now, as an adult, I have chosen to put in this exhibition a somewhat different Egyptian artefact. It is an ostracon, a stone fragment used to write or draw on, possibly made by a tomb builder. The maker has mimicked the formal funerary style used to portray the pharaohs, but has instead depicted a man and a woman doing something more, well, life-affirming.\nRight under your nose\nOne of my favourite objects is an example of dissent more or less hiding in plain sight. I passed it in the galleries and thought it was beautiful, but had no idea that there might be any hidden meaning within it. It is the Stonyhurst salt, an elaborate piece of tableware created from recycled reliquaries.\nThe Stonyhurst Salt. Salt cellar made in 1577 in London for Catholic patrons.\nThe object was made in England in the 1570s, at a time when Catholic worship had been banned. It is passing itself off as a salt-cellar, but on closer examination this is clearly unconvincing. How many salt-cellars were made from silver gilt and decorated with rock crystal \u2013 the emblem of Christ\u2019s purity \u2013 and rubies that look exactly like drops of blood \u2013 Christ\u2019s blood to be exact? It is obviously a piece of outlawed Catholic ornamentation pretending to be something else. Presumably it gave its owners a huge amount of satisfaction at the dinner table.\n(Literally) in your face\nRichard Newton (1777-1798), Treason!!! Etching, 1798. Buy a print in our online shop.\nHowever, there are some items in this exhibition that you can appreciate almost immediately. This British satirical print from the eighteenth century showing John Bull, the embodiment of Britain, farting at a portrait of George III is not too difficult to decipher. The English do love a witticism about breaking wind, and Newton\u2019s unsubtle joke is a perfect example of \u2018in your face\u2019 comedy \u2013 the country is depicted, literally, farting in the King\u2019s face.\nAncient graffiti\nBabylonian brick stamped with the name of King Nebuchadnezzar II, 604-561 BC. Inscribed on the back of the brick is also the name of the workman that produced it.\nWhen I was younger I was terrified of the huge bearded winged figures in the Assyrian galleries, who had the heads of humans and the bodies of bulls. In this exhibition there is a rather more humble piece of ancient sculpture \u2013 this Babylonian brick in fact \u2013 inscribed with the name of the king, in accordance with regulation. But in an act of defiance, the maker has carved his own name on the brick as well, \u00a0to suggest, I think, that it is no less silly for him than for the great ruler to commemorate himself on such an item. The brick was then put in a wall and was probably never meant to be seen again, so we have no idea if \u2018Zabina\u2019 showed his handiwork to his friends and they shared a laugh at his audacity, or whether he did it entirely in secret. I like the thought that this brickmaker, nearly 2,500 years ago, quite literally made his mark on the world. It\u2019s a fantastic, very ancient, small act of rebellion.\nA wicked Bible?\nExodus, The Holy Bible, 1611. This edition contains a misprint in Exodus xx. 14, \u201cThou shalt commit adultery.\u201d \u00a9 British Library Board (C.24.a.41)\nSometimes we cannot be sure whether an act of dissent is deliberate, or the result of an innocent mistake. This 1631 edition of the King James Bible, published under the names of Robert Barker and Martin Lucas, is known as the \u2018Wicked Bible\u2019 owing to a printing error in the Seventh Commandment (Exodus 20:14) that states: \u2018Thou shalt commit adultery.\u2019 Elsewhere at Deuteronomy 5:24 another misprint changes \u2018God\u2019s greateness\u2019 to \u2018God\u2019s great asse\u2019. You can either believe that this is the most unfortunate mistake in the entire history of printing, or you can believe that it was deliberate. Of all the possible errors, one just happens to occur in the middle of the Ten Commandments in the bit about whether you can have sex with other people or not. Coincidence does not extend that far. I don\u2019t buy it!"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-british-museum-membercast-the-seaside-part-2/", "category": "Podcasts", "title": "The British Museum Membercast: The seaside (Part 2)", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2018-08-29 00:00:00", "text": "The British Museum Membercast is a monthly podcast made available to \u2018all studious and curious persons\u2019.

It is one of the earliest known cities of the world, revered in the 3rd millennium BC as the sanctuary of the Sumerian heroic god Ningirsu.\nIn 2015\u20132016, a potential crime scene was recorded as part of an initial survey at Tello that consisted of dozens of shallow pits. These pits can be traced back to a period of looting at this historical site at the beginning of 2003, with the missing objects likely transferred quickly for sale in London.\nThey were seized in a police operation on 2 May 2003, when the dealer failed to supply proof of ownership, subsequently ceased trading and the objects passed to the Crown. They were recently brought to the British Museum for analysis by the Art & Antiques Unit of the Metropolitan Police.\nOne of three votive cones being returned to Iraq. They are inscribed in ancient cuneiform script which helped British Museum experts identify them as originating from the site at Tello.\nThree of the objects are fired clay cones with Sumerian inscriptions in cuneiform script (a language formed by using small wedges to make up symbols) which identify their origin as the Eninnu temple, sacred to the god\u2019s patron deity Ningirsu. The inscriptions read: \u2018For Ningirsu, Enlil\u2019s mighty warrior, Gudea, ruler of Lagash, made things function as they should (and) he built and restored for him his Eninnu, the White Thunderbird\u2019.\nThe other items consist of a broken gypsum mace-head with an Old Sumerian inscription, a polished river pebble with a cuneiform inscription, a white marble amulet pendant in the form of a reclining bull dating to the Jemdet Nasr period (c. 3000 BC), a red marble stamp seal or amulet pendant representing a pair of stylised animals, and a white chalcedony stamp seal which dates to the Achaemenid period (c. 550\u2013330 BC). All of these resemble objects known from excavations at Tello and are therefore most likely to originate from the same site.\nObjects looted from the site of Tello in 2003 are being returned to Iraq.\nRecently, these objects were handed over to the Iraqi authorities at a small ceremony held at the British Museum, and will be returned to Baghdad where they are likely to go on display in the Iraq Museum.\nSpeaking of the Tello find, Dr Salih Husain Ali, Ambassador of the Republic of Iraq to the UK, said \u2018I would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the British Museum and the staff for their exceptional efforts in the process of identifying and returning looted antiquities to Iraq.\u2019\nSebastien Rey working with Iraqi state police in 2015 to identify areas of looting at Tello.\nThe site of Tello is now protected and the ongoing British Museum excavations have not only recorded the old looting pits but are revealing the full plan of the Eninnu temple, reconstructing how the fired clay cones were originally set within its walls and the extent of the occupation there in other periods.\nDirector of the British Museum, Hartwig Fischer, said, \u2018The British Museum is absolutely committed to the fight against illicit trade and damage to cultural heritage. This is an issue which concerns us all. I am delighted that we are able to assist in the return of these important objects to Iraq, via the Embassy of the Republic of Iraq in London.

From the 1890s he became increasingly experimental, creating strangely poetic new compositions.\nRodin reused several of his own sculptures in his assemblages, and was particularly inspired by the vast number of figures from his major work\u00a0The Gates of Hell\u00a0(including The Kiss and The Thinker).\nAuguste Rodin, The Sphinx. Terracotta and plaster maquette, around 1903. S. 368. \u00a9 Mus\u00e9e Rodin, Paris. Photo: Christian Baraja.\nFor example, this figure of a crouching woman (entitled The Sphinx) was originally from the right door panel of The Gates of Hell. In the assemblage known as\u00a0the Birth of Venus, the sphinx has been rotated in order to connect it to the other figure.\nAuguste Rodin, Birth of Venus. Plaster, 1903. S. 2630. \u00a9 Mus\u00e9e Rodin. Photo: Christian Baraja.\nIn this incredible assemblage you can see several nails which are reference points, as this plaster cast was used to carve a marble version. You might also notice that some parts (the arms and the head) don\u2019t seem fully integrated into the body. This is because Rodin put together small parts of the body from different sculptures, which he called \u2018abattis\u2019,\u00a0to create a new work of art.\nFrom about 1895 Rodin started to collect ceramics and began exploring the technique of creating assemblages with some of these ancient vases. He would choose a figure and a vase that would form a harmonious group, and joined the two elements together with plaster. In a very modern manner, Rodin reused ancient vases as so-called \u2018readymades\u2019 for his sculpture.\nAuguste Rodin, Birth of Venus with the Head of a Slavic Woman. Plaster, after 1900. S. 3473. \u00a9 Mus\u00e9e Rodin, Paris. Photo: Paul Hisbacq.\nHere you can see a maquette which shows the figure of the Birth of Venus without arms, simply assembled with Rodin\u2019s\u00a0Head of a Slavic Woman. This was probably a preparatory study for the Birth of Venus above. In the Birth of Venus, Rodin added two arms to complete the sculpture. Unlike this maquette with the Head of a Slavic Woman, in the later work, he positioned the two heads so that the two figures are looking at each other.\nAuguste Rodin, Heads of a Slavic Woman, Plaster, before 1890. S. 4460, S. 4377, S. 4384. \u00a9 Mus\u00e9e Rodin, Paris. Photo: Paul Hisbacq.\nThe Head of a Slavic Woman was reproduced many times in Rodin\u2019s studio. You can imagine how the space was strewn with many small pieces of sculpture, all ready to be assembled.\nAuguste Rodin, Birth of Venus in a cast of a Boeotian cup, After 1895, Plaster, Mus\u00e9e Rodin, S. 3612. \u00a9 Mus\u00e9e Rodin, Paris. Photo: Christian Baraja.\nRodin also stuck the same Venus figure without any head onto a plaster cast from a Greek Boeotian cup. The original material, texture and function of the vase were altered, leaving only its shape in a new material that was integrated into Rodin\u2019s sculpture. The body emerges from the mouth of the vase defying gravity, at the very edge of imbalance.\nAuguste Rodin, Birth of Venus.\u00a0Graphite with stump and watercolour on paper, around 1900.

Photo: Christian Baraja.\nThe recurring sculpted figure of the Birth of Venus appears again in an assemblage with an ancient vase in the shape of a basket known as a kalathos. Rodin revered antiquities, and this vase from his own collection became incorporated as an element of his own work through his use of the assemblage technique. The small female figure, in a relaxed pose, rests casually on the rim.\nThese assemblages reveal that Rodin\u2019s studio was a laboratory of endless experimentation and ideas.\nYou can discover many of these pieces and other sculptures by Rodin in the exhibition Rodin and the art of ancient Greece (until 29 July 2018).\nSponsored by Bank of America Merrill Lynch."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-british-museum-membercast-nefertitis-face/", "category": "Podcasts", "title": "The British Museum Membercast: Nefertiti\u2019s face", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2018-06-26 00:00:00", "text": "The British Museum Membercast is a monthly podcast made available to \u2018all studious and curious persons\u2019.

It seems likely that more Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) themed projects took place last year than in any year since the passing of the Sexual Offences Act in July 1967. Although the anniversary year is now behind us, work is ongoing at many organisations, including the British Museum, to ensure that these temporary projects leave a lasting, permanent legacy.\nThe objects in this blog post featured in our Desire, love, identity: exploring LGBTQ histories special display and trail in 2017. With this, we highlighted some particularly important objects in the Museum\u2019s collection that provide glimpses into what the English novelist E M Forster described as a \u2018great unrecorded history.\u2019 Here we take a look at some of the objects from the trail that feature in our new audio commentary tour and the Desire, love, identity: exploring LGBTQ histories touring exhibition, which will be visiting venues around the UK from this August.\nVase depicting Sappho\nGreek water-jar (hydria). c. 450 BC.\nEvidence of real female sexuality is difficult to find in ancient Greek and Roman objects as they usually reflect male perspectives.\u00a0In ancient Greece women were generally excluded from public life and politics, but they did take part in domestic and religious rituals.\u00a0The poet Sappho (630\u2013570 BC), who lived on the isle of Lesbos, gave a voice to women and female desire that has resonated throughout history. She is probably the seated figure on this water jar.\u00a0 By the 19th century her poetry had made the word for an inhabitant of Lesbos a term for a woman who loves women. Little is known for certain about Sappho\u2019s life but her poetry has been an inspiration to many women living in later eras.\nThis vase can be seen in Room 69.\nA Maya ruler\nCast of Stela H from The Great Plaza, Copan, Honduras. Cast made by Lorenzo Giuntini 1881-1894, copied from an original dating from 730 AD.\nThis image of a male Maya ruler was once assumed to be female, as he is wearing a netted jade skirt worn by elite Maya women. He is, in fact, dressed as a youthful maize god whose gender can be both male and female. When gender is being read cross-culturally, there can be confusion or misunderstandings. There are many instances of early European explorers, researchers and collectors initially being unable, or perhaps unwilling, to make sense of values that differed from their own.\nThis plaster cast can be found on the ground floor of the East Stairs (between Room 1 and Room 27).\nThe Warren Cup\nThe Warren Cup. Roman, c. 10 AD\nDecorated with two scenes of male lovers, this Roman wine cup couldn\u2019t be displayed publicly for most of the 20th century. Homosexuality was illegal in England and Wales until July 1967. However explicit sexual images were not unusual in the Roman world. Relationships between men were part of Greek and Roman culture, from slaves to emperors, most famously the emperor Hadrian and his lover, Antinous. Today such ancient images remind us that the way societies view sexuality can differ widely. The Warren Cup was acquired by the Museum in 1999 and, with the exception of short periods of time when it has been loaned to other institutions, has been on display ever since.\nThe cup can be found in Room 70.\nNative American \u2018winter count\u2019\nNorth American \u2018winter count\u2019.\n\u2018Winter counts\u2019 were kept as historical records by some North American plains tribes. This is one of many surviving versions of a Sioux count showing events for the winters of 1785-6 to 1901-02. The year 1891 includes an image representing the suicide of a winkte, a Dakota word literally meaning \u2018wants to be a woman.\u2019 Among some Native American tribes such individuals were considered to be endowed with special spiritual powers because they bridged gender differences. Among the Dakota Sioux there were, at any given time, up to ten recorded individuals belonging to this class of people in the same tribe. The arrival of Anglo-Americans led to repression of cross-dressing by such individuals. Today there has been a revival of this tradition among younger generations of LGBTQ Native Americans.\nThis object is not currently on display but will be part of the UK touring exhibition Desire, love, identity; exploring LGBTQ histories.\nN\u2019domo mask from Mali\nN\u2019domo mask. Mali, early 20th century.\nIn many African cultures gender and gendered roles are fixed through rituals. N\u2019domo masks are used by the Bamana people of Mali. They are worn by men but the masks can be male, female or androgynous. The number of horns is significant\u00a0\u2013 male masks have 3 or 6 horns, female masks have 4 or 8, and androgynous masks have 2, 5 or 7.\nGender\u00a0and\u00a0sexual\u00a0diversity was often suppressed by colonial administrators in Africa and this has sometimes been forgotten, creating the impression that it never existed. Partly as a result of this colonial history and the introduction of Christianity, \u2018homosexuality\u2019 was made illegal in many African countries.\u00a0Anti-apartheid and civil rights movements have often run parallel to those for LGBTQ people around the world.\u00a0In 2012 Archbishop Tutu commented: \u2018I have no doubt in the future, the laws that criminalise so many forms of love and human commitment will look the way apartheid laws do to us now \u2013 so obviously wrong.\u2019\nThis mask is currently displayed in Room 25 and it will be part of the UK touring exhibition Desire, love, identity; exploring LGBTQ histories.\nThe Ladies of Llangollen\nChocolate cups and saucers. 1779-81 and 1790.\nLady Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby fled Ireland together in 1778. They set up home in North Wales, challenging the conventions of the era and living the life of their choice for 50 years. Eleanor\u2019s diary gives us an insight to their lifestyle. She writes on Thursday 22 September 1785:\nUp at Seven. Dark Morning, all the Mountains enveloped in mist. Thick Rain. A fire in the Library, delightfully comfortable, Breakfasted at half past Eight. From nine \u2018till one writing. My Beloved drawing Pembroke Castle \u2013 from one to three read to her \u2013 after dinner Went hastily around the gardens. Rain\u2019d without interruption the entire day \u2013 from Four \u2018till Ten reading to my Sally \u2013 She drawing \u2013 from ten \u2018till Eleven Sat over the Fire Conversing with My beloved. A Silent, happy Day.\nThis pair of chocolate cups belonged to Eleanor and Sarah. The ladies acquired a celebrity-like status and the Museum also has several prints depicting them in its collection.\nThe cups are on display in Room 47. One of the cups will be part of the UK touring exhibition Desire, love, identity; exploring LGBTQ histories.\nStatue of Ganymede\nStatue of Ganymede. Roman, 100-200 AD.\nIn Greek myth the god Zeus (Jupiter to the Romans) was overcome by desire for the beautiful youth Ganymede. He took the form of an eagle to abduct Ganymede, who later became the god\u2019s cupbearer. There are many depictions of Ganymede in the Museum\u2019s collection \u2013 this particular one is Roman. Ancient Greece exerted a heavy influence over Rome, including an acceptance of sexual relationships between men within certain boundaries. The adoption of Christianity marked a significant change in attitudes. During the medieval period the term Ganymede became a term of abuse. The Renaissance led to a renewed interest in classical mythology, including subjects that offered a legitimate way to depict sexual stories.\u00a0Statues such as this were popular with wealthy European collectors during the 1700s and 1800s.\nYou can see this statue in Room 1.\nFollowing the trail and the exhibition in 2017, we wanted to find a find a way to ensure these objects\u2019 stories were still told when the interpretation was removed. In response to feedback from visitors, we have created a Desire, love, identity: exploring LGBTQ histories audio commentary, narrated by Simon Russell Beale and Fiona Shaw, which you can listen to at the museum or from home. There\u2019s also a new downloadable map, which will help you find the objects in the museum. It should take between 75\u201390 minutes to visit all the objects and listen to the commentary. You can download the commentaries or stream them via iTunes, Google Play Music, and Spotify. Follow the links here or search \u2018Desire, love, identity: exploring LGBTQ histories\u2019.\nIn 2019 we will also be introducing volunteer-led LGBTQ gallery talks that delve into even more detail and look at objects that aren\u2019t in the audio commentaries. If you\u2019re interested in participating and helping shape and/or deliver these tours, and be part of our incredible team of volunteers, please check the volunteer section of the Museum\u2019s website for further details, which will be released soon.\nThe national touring exhibition, Desire, love, identity: exploring LGBTQ histories, will visit the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (25 September \u2013 2 December 2018), the National Justice Museum, Nottingham (14 December 2018 \u2013 3 March 2019), Bolton Library & Museum Service (14 March \u2013 26 May 2019), and Norwich Millennium Library (8 June \u2013 31 August 2019).\nI want to thank all the incredibly generous people who have contributed to these projects. The LGBTQ activity that has taken place to date would not have been possible without Professor Richard Parkinson (Oxford University), Camden LGBT Forum, Gendered Intelligence, LGBT History Month, London Metropolitan Archives, the Network, Schools Out and Untold London. I\u2019d also like to thank Dan Vo and his colleagues at the V&A for generously and enthusiastically sharing their experiences of developing volunteer-led LGBTQ tours with us.\nA Little Gay History: desire and diversity across the world\u00a0by Richard Parkinson is available from the Museum shops.\nImage caption:\u00a0The Warren Cup.

It first asserted control over a large area in the 14th century BC, but by the 12th century BC it had collapsed.\nDuring the 10th and 9th centuries BC, Assyria gradually recovered, reclaiming lost lands, and campaigning in new ones. By the 7th century BC, the last great Assyrian king, Ashurbanipal, ruled over a geographically and culturally diverse empire, shaping the lives of peoples from the eastern Mediterranean to western Iran. When people talk of \u2018Assyria\u2019, it generally means the time of its great flourishing between the 9th and 7th centuries BC, sometimes referred to today as the \u2018Neo-Assyrian empire\u2019.\nMap of the Assyrian empire\u00a0at its greatest extent during the reign of Ashurbanipal (668 BC to c. 627 BC)\nLiving in luxury\nThe kings of the Neo-Assyrian empire built on a lavish scale. They ruled from their capital cities at Ashur, Nimrud, Khorsabad and Nineveh. When a king decided to move his capital or to simply rebuild it, they made sure it was bigger and better than what came before.\nArtist\u2019s impression\u00a0of Assyrian palaces from\u00a0The Monuments of Nineveh by Sir Austen Henry Layard, 1853.\nNineveh was transformed by King Sennacherib (reigned 705\u2013681 BC) into a metropolis whose size and splendour would astonish the ancient world. It covered 7\u00a0square kilometres and its palaces and temples were adorned with colossal sculptures and brilliantly carved reliefs. An intricate system of canals and aqueducts watered the king\u2019s pleasure gardens and game parks. Sennacherib\u2019s grand residence, the \u2018Palace Without Rival\u2019, was built \u2018to be an object of wonder for all the people\u2019. Visitors entered the palace through massive gateways flanked by colossal human-headed winged bulls (called lamassu) that protected the king from dangerous supernatural forces.\nSculpture of a winged bull (lamassu) from the Assyrian city of Nimrud. 865 \u2013 860 BC. Similar sculptures would have flanked the entrance to King Sennacherib\u2019s palace in Nineveh.\nSennacherib\u2019s grandson Ashurbanipal ruled from this palace for most of his reign (669\u2013631 BC), before moving to a new royal residence at Nineveh. His \u2018North Palace\u2019 was decorated with reliefs painted in vivid colours that glorified his rule and achievements.\nSupreme power\nThe king\u2019s power was absolute, assigned through the divine will of the Assyrian deity Ashur. For the Assyrians, the heartland of the empire, with its magnificent cities, was the perfect vision of civilised order. Foreign lands were thought to be full of chaos and disorder. As the earthly representative of the gods, it was the king\u2019s duty to create order in the world by conquering foreign lands and absorbing them into Assyria.\nAs the shepherd of his people, the king also protected Assyria from foreign enemies or wild animals. The most dangerous animal in Assyria was the lion, which came to symbolise all that was wild and chaotic in the world. Assyrian kings proved they were worthy by hunting these fearsome beasts. The royal hunt was a drama-filled public spectacle staged at game parks near the cities. Lion hunting was represented in Assyrian art, most famously in the reliefs from king Ashurbanipal\u2019s palace.\nRelief depicting Ashurbanipal hunting a lion. 645 \u2013 635 BC.\nMilitary might\nAssyria\u2019s rapid expansion was achieved through force. By the mid-8th century BC, Assyrian kings commanded a professional standing army with chariots, cavalry and infantry. This massive army was supplemented by the king\u2019s personal bodyguard of elite troops. The army grew as it absorbed members of defeated enemy armies, which gave rise to a multicultural military force drawn from all corners of the empire.\nThe Assyrians preferred to mount surprise attacks against an inferior force to guarantee an easy victory. Large fortified cities with multiple moats, walls and towers could take years to capture. A city\u2019s fortifications could be breached using siege engines, battering rams and sappers. To avoid heavy casualties, the Assyrian army would blockade a city with siege forts to cut off its supplies, reinforcements, and any means of escape.\nRelief depicting the siege of an Egyptian fort.\u00a0645 \u2013 635 BC.\nMilitary conquest was followed by the extraction of wealth through plunder, tribute payments, taxation \u2013 and even people. Entire populations from defeated kingdoms were forcibly deported and resettled elsewhere within the empire. Deportees could be exploited\u00a0\u2013 conscripted into the army, made to populate newly established cities, and resettled in underdeveloped provinces to work the land. The most valued \u2013 elite families, specialist craftsmen and scholars \u2013 were settled and put to work in the major cities. Here they could support public works, produce luxury goods, and generate knowledge for the benefit of the empire.\nRelief showing the looting of the Elamite city of Hamanu. c. 645 \u2013 635 BC.\nDivine punishment\nAs the earthly representative of the gods, it was the king\u2019s duty to punish Assyria\u2019s enemies. Captured enemy leaders and rebels were displayed alongside the spoils of war and publicly humiliated in triumphal parades. Some were forced to wear the heads of their accomplices around their necks, others were chained to the gates of the city like dogs, or hitched up to the king\u2019s chariot like horses. The message was simple\u00a0\u2013 mess with Assyria and you will face the consequences. This kind of violence was thought to be a form of divine justice against those who had opposed the king and the gods\nTrusted eunuchs\nAssyrian kings liked to present themselves as the sole protectors of the empire. In reality, the empire was organised into a patchwork of provinces, each supervised by a governor appointed by the king. The governors made up a group of officials called the \u2018Great Ones\u2019, which formed the king\u2019s cabinet. The \u2018Great Ones\u2019 held considerable power, so much so that they could even threaten the king\u2019s rule.\nInitially, these state positions were inherited, but their considerable wealth and influence posed a threat to the king. To counter this, the Assyrians devised an innovative scheme to ensure that positions of power were awarded on merit and not through family ties. They appointed eunuchs to positions of power because they could not father children and therefore could not build dynasties of their own. Only the king could pass power down family lines.\nRelief depicting a eunuch. 710 \u2013 705 BC.\nA library fit for a king\nMuch of what we know about Assyrian history and culture is from written records. Assyrians used the ancient writing technique of cuneiform, which was first developed by the Sumerians around 3000 BC. Texts were written by pressing a reed pen into soft clay. The characteristic wedge-shaped strokes give the writing its modern name (cuneiform means simply \u2018wedge-shaped\u2019). Cuneiform tablets were used to record everything from day-to-day administration to science and literature.\nFragment of a clay tablet with inscription in cuneiform, written for the library of Ashurbanipal. 7th century BC.\nKing Ashurbanipal seems to have wanted a copy of every book worth having. His interest in books was not for entertainment. They helped him communicate with the gods and learn what the future held. There were books about omens from sacrifices, the heavens, and the earthly world. Alongside them were rituals and calendars, hymns and prayers, and magic and medicine.\nRoyal Mail\nThe empire\u2019s unity depended on a reliable and efficient communications network. To speed up the transfer of information, the empire was connected by an innovative system of royal roads, along which express mail could travel. It only took a few days for news to travel between the capital and the furthest reaches of the empire. If a message was particularly sensitive, state letters would travel with a trusted envoy across the entire distance to hand deliver the message.\nClay letter and envelope. 8th century BC.\nAccess to the royal mail service was only granted to the king\u2019s most trusted officials. Each wore a golden signet ring engraved with an image of the royal seal\u00a0\u2013 the Assyrian king slaying a ferocious lion. Letters sealed by these rings carried royal authority and any instructions had to be obeyed. By delegating royal power, the king could be in many places at once.\nClay seal showing an Assyrian king in combat with a lion. 715 BC.\nThe end of an empire\nFollowing the death of Ashurbanipal around 631 BC, it took just under 20 years for the empire to crumble. The Babylonians, under their leader Nabopolassar, rebelled against Assyrian rule, causing chaos throughout the land. Conditions under siege were dire, the populace stricken by disease and famine. Parents were forced to sell their children to buy food. Gradually, Nabopolassar won the upper hand and advanced into Assyria. A war of independence became a fight for Assyria\u2019s survival.\nAssyria was doomed when the Medes from western Iran, lead by Cyaxares, joined the assault by sacking the holy city of Ashur. Nabopolassar and Cyaxares swore an alliance that was to seal Assyria\u2019s fate. In 612 BC the two armies converged on Nineveh. The greatest city in existence fell, its palaces and temples burnt to the ground, and the last Assyrian king to reign from Nineveh, Sin-shar-ishkun, perished in the flames\nAssyria into legend\nThe fall of Assyria was an iconic event that was recorded in passages of the Bible and by Greek and Roman writers. Accounts describe how Assyria was punished for the moral depravity of its rulers, who surrounded themselves with great riches and luxury. According to classical sources, Assyria\u2019s last king was so debauched that he caused the empire\u2019s complete destruction. Realising that Nineveh was lost, he erected an enormous pyre in the palace and consigned himself to the flames along with his vast wealth, concubines and eunuchs.\nJohn Martin, The Fall of Nineveh. Print, 1829.\nThe negative image of Assyria was challenged by archaeological discoveries of the mid-nineteenth century, which established Assyria as one of the great civilisations of the ancient world.\nAssyria rediscovered\nAlthough a number of travellers and explorers had visited the Assyrian sites of Nimrud and Nineveh, they weren\u2019t excavated until the mid-19th century, when a young British diplomat, Austen Henry Layard, started work at Nimrud. Layard\u2019s remarkable discoveries at Nimrud included colossal winged bulls and carved stone reliefs from the Assyrian palaces, which attracted sponsorship from the British Museum. Layard moved his team to the main mound at Nineveh in 1847, where he discovered the \u2018Palace Without Rival\u2019, king Sennacherib\u2019s great royal residence.\nFrederick Charles Cooper. Drawing showing the winged bulls found by Layard at Nimrud. Watercolour on paper, mid-19th century.\nArrangements were made with the Ottoman government to have the Assyrian sculptures shipped to Britain. Due to the size of the sculptures, this proved to be some task. Firstly, the sculptures were transported to the river Tigris, where they were loaded on rafts that sailed to the city of Basra in southern Iraq. From here they were placed on a steamship and taken to Bombay in India, before sailing around Africa to England, where they were finally transported to the British Museum.\nLayard\u2019s discoveries caused a media sensation and captured the public imagination. This had a major impact on painting and applied arts, in the UK and beyond, during the second half of the nineteenth century, which led to a brief phase of \u2018Assyrian revival\u2019. The Assyrian sculptures at the British Museum largely remain today where they were first installed over 160 years ago.\nDiscover more about Assyria and its last great king in the BP exhibition I am Ashurbanipal: king of the world, king of Assyria (8 November 2018 \u2013 24 February 2019).\nSupported by BP\nLogistics partner IAG Cargo"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/who-was-ashurbanipal/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Who was Ashurbanipal?", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2018-06-19 00:00:00", "text": "A new major exhibition opening in November 2018 is about one of history\u2019s greatest forgotten kings\u00a0\u2013 Ashurbanipal. Never heard of him? Don\u2019t worry, you aren\u2019t alone! Here is a quick guide to this powerful and fascinating ancient ruler.\nHe ruled the largest empire in the world\nAshurbanipal was king of the Neo-Assyrian empire. At the time of his reign (669\u2013c. 631 BC) it was the largest empire in the world, stretching from Cyprus in the west to Iran in the east, and at one point it even included Egypt. Its capital Nineveh (in modern-day Iraq) was the world\u2019s largest city. This is at a time when the Greek city-states (like Athens and Sparta) were still in their infancy and Rome was just a small settlement.\nAshurbanipal wasn\u2019t modest about being the king of the Assyrian empire\u00a0\u2013 he called himself \u2018king of the world\u2019! Quite a claim, but given the size of the empire, it wasn\u2019t far from the truth.\nHe wasn\u2019t meant to be king\nStele depicting Ashurbanipal (right) and his brother\u00a0Shamash-shum-ukin (left).\u00a0668 \u2013 655 BC.\nDespite being one of Assyria\u2019s greatest kings, Ashurbanipal wasn\u2019t destined for the throne, as he was a younger son of the king.\nWhen his eldest brother and the heir to the throne died, his father Esarhaddon passed over the next eldest son Shamash-shum-ukin, and made Ashurbanipal crown prince instead. This was a bold (and perhaps a slightly foolish) move. Esarhaddon\u2019s own father had been brutally murdered by his sons after he put their younger sibling (i.e. Esarhaddon) on the throne!\nShamash-shum-ukin, would have been pretty annoyed about the decision to bypass him. As a consolation, Esarhaddon made Shamash-shum-ukin king of Babylon. That doesn\u2019t sound so bad, right? Well, not quite. At this time, Babylon was part of the Assyrian empire so he would essentially have to answer to his younger brother! Tensions would later explode into all-out war.\nAt the command of the great gods, [my father] greatly preferred me over the assembly of my elder brothers.\nHe worked as a spymaster\nWhen Ashurbanipal was appointed crown prince, he started his training to be king. He learnt royal etiquette, important military skills and was instructed in scholarship. He shadowed his father in court where he could learn the way of Assyrian kingship.\nHe also worked as a spymaster for his father, gathering information from agents across the empire and compiling intelligence reports. This helped to develop Ashurbanipal\u2019s knowledge of the empire \u2013 and learn who his potential enemies were.\nHe hunted lions\nFrederick Arthur Bridgman (1847\u20131928), The Diversion of an Assyrian King. Oil on canvas, 1878.\nAs part of his military training, the young crown prince was taught to drive chariots, ride cavalry horses, and develop skills such as archery. He also learnt how to hunt lions. In Assyria lion hunting was a royal \u2018sport\u2019. Although this perhaps seems cruel to modern eyes, killing lions represented the king\u2019s ability to protect his nation against all that was wild and dangerous in the world.\nI pierced the throats of raging lions, each with a single arrow.\nRelief depicting Ashurbanipal hunting a lion. 645 \u2013 635 BC.\nAshurbanipal commissioned a series of\u00a0reliefs \u2013 a sculptural technique where the sculpted elements remain attached to a solid background of the same material \u2013 to cover the walls of his palace which showed him hunting, and even strangling lions with his bare hands. These works are some of the most famous examples of Assyrian art.\nHe crushed his enemies\nAshurbanipal was popular among his subjects but ruthless in dealing with enemies. He was said to have put a dog chain through the jaw of a defeated king and made him live in a dog kennel. That\u2019s pretty brutal, even by the standards of the ancient world.\nAshurbanipal inherited a war with Egypt (and other neighbouring regions), which he went to work dealing with, destroying his enemies and growing the empire even further.\nWhen the state of Elam tried to rise up against Assyria, Ashurbanipal crushed them. He claimed to have killed the Elamite king and his son with his own sword (in reality, he was not at the battle, but at home in the safety of his palace). The Elamite king\u2019s head was brought back to the palace in Nineveh where it was hung from a tree in the garden as a decoration. Most people would see this as a very clear warning \u2013 don\u2019t mess with Ashurbanipal!\nWith the help of Ashur [the patron god of Assyria] and Ishtar, I killed them. Their heads I cut off in front of each other.\nRelief depicting Ashurbanipal relaxing in his garden. The head of the Elamite king hangs from a tree on the far left.\u00a0645 \u2013 635 BC.\nAshurbanipal spent a lot of effort dealing with Elam\u2019s troublesome rulers, who plotted against Assyria. The exasperated Ashurbanipal decided to crush Elam once and for all. He robbed the palaces and temples and ordered that the royal tombs be opened and the bones of kings taken. Those who survived were brought back to Assyria in chains as slaves.\nI had the sanctuaries of the land Elam utterly destroyed and I counted its gods and its goddesses as ghosts\u2026 I destroyed and devastated the tombs of their earlier and later kings\u2026 I took their bones to Assyria. I prevented their ghosts from sleeping and deprived them of funerary-offerings and libations\u2026 On a march of one month and twenty-five days, I devastated the districts of the land Elam and scattered salt and cress over them.\nDetail of a relief showing the Assyrian siege of an Elamite fort.\u00a0645 \u2013 635 BC.\nHe was responsible for the death of his brother\nCrushing enemies was not confined to external threats \u2013 he also destroyed his own brother. As we\u2019ve already seen, Ashurbanipal\u2019s brother Shamash-shum-ukin had been created king of Babylon. Fed up of answering to Ashurbanipal, his brother conspired against him, creating a coalition with other outlying peoples in the empire and taking contested cities in the name of Babylon.\nWhen Ashurbanipal discovered the plot, he laid siege to Babylon for two years! There were horrific stories of people eating their own children to survive starvation. In the end Ashurbanipal\u2019s brother died in his burning palace to escape capture and his co-conspirators were killed.\nAs for the rest of the people, those still alive \u2026 I myself now laid flat those people there as a funerary-offering\u2026 I fed their dismembered flesh to dogs, pigs, vultures, eagles, birds of the heavens, and fish of the aps\u00fb [waters].\nRelief depicting the Assyrian capture of Babylon. 638 \u2013 625BC\nHe built a great library\nWhile he wasn\u2019t crushing enemies and killing lions, perhaps incongruously Ashurbanipal enjoyed scholarly pursuits. He could read and write, which was unusual for a king. He loved to boast about his scholarly abilities, and he even represented himself in his palace reliefs with a stylus (used for writing) in his belt, along with his sword. The pen may be mightier than the sword, but Ashurbanipal was pretty handy with both!\nAshurbanipal developed the first systematically collected and catalogued library in the world. He wanted a copy of every book worth having and sent his minions across the empire to gather all the knowledge in the world. Assyrian books were mostly written on clay tablets, not on paper, in a script called cuneiform, which used little wedges to make up symbols. In total he gathered hundreds of thousands of these tablets, around 30,000 of which are now in the British Museum.\nSome of the tablets from the library of Ashurbanipal at the museum.\nAshurbanipal claimed:\nI, Ashurbanipal, learned the wisdom of Nabu [the god of writing], laid hold of scribal practices of all the experts, as many as there are, I examined their instructions.\nAshurbanipal\u2019s library was buried beneath the burning walls of his palace and was lost for over 2,000 years. The first broken and scattered remains of the library were found in 1849 and are now at the British Museum. Scholars from around the world have studied these fragments since and much of what we know about Assyrian culture comes from these texts.\nFragment of a clay tablet, which tells the story of the flood from the Epic of Gilgamesh.\n7th century BC.\nAmong the works were the Epic of Gilgamesh, now considered one of the oldest works of literature in the world. Part of it was recorded on what we now call the \u2018Flood Tablet\u2019 which told the story of the Great Flood, and until that time was only known from the Bible.\nHe lived in luxury\nIllustration of Assyrian palaces from\u00a0The Monuments of Nineveh by Sir Austen Henry Layard, 1853.\nAshurbanipal reigned from his royal capital at Nineveh. The Assyrian kings built on a lavish scale. The city of Nineveh was transformed by Ashurbanipal\u2019s grandfather, Sennacherib, into a large city whose size and splendour astonished the ancient world.\nAshurbanipal ruled for most of his reign from the \u2018Palace Without Rival\u2019, which was built \u2018to be an object of wonder for all the people\u2019. Visitors entered the palace through massive gateways flanked by colossal human-headed winged bulls (known as lamassu) that protected the king from dangerous supernatural forces.\nIllustration of a hall in an Assyrian palace from\u00a0The Monuments of Nineveh by Sir Austen Henry Layard, 1853.\nThe royal gardens at Nineveh were spectacular. They were irrigated by canals which stretched over 50km into the mountains in order to make them a year-round oasis of all types of flora. There is a recent argument that the legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon (one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World) were actually those at Nineveh and later writers had confused Nineveh and Babylon. Even if this isn\u2019t the case, Ashurbanipal\u2019s gardens were certainly impressive and exotic. The king collected plants from across the empire and brought them back to his capital. (Not to mention the head of his enemy\u2026)\nHis death is a mystery\nAshurbanipal\u2019s life is well documented but his death remains a mystery. Before archaeological discoveries were made in the 19th century, Ashurbanipal was known through later writers as Sardanapalus and was romanticised as the last king of Assyria. One Persian account says that he burnt himself in his palace alongside his concubines, gold and silver, when Nineveh fell under his enemies. This was famously reimagined in Delacroix\u2019s dramatic Orientalist painting The Death of Sardanapalus.\nEug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798\u20131863), Death of Sardanapalus. Oil on canvas, 1827.\nArchaeological evidence has proven that Ashurbanipal wasn\u2019t the last king of Assyria and that he didn\u2019t die during the fall of Nineveh. However, shortly after his death, in around 612 BC, the empire weakened and various groups sacked Assyrian cities, leading to the empire\u2019s collapse. Little is known about the kings that succeeded him so the legend of Ashurbanipal as Assyria\u2019s last great king does have some truth to it.\nYou can discover more about Ashurbanipal in the BP exhibition I am Ashurbanipal: king of the world, king of Assyria which is at the Museum from 8 November 2018 \u2013 24 February 2019.\n\nSupported by BP\nLogistics partner IAG Cargo"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-story-of-sugar-in-5-objects/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "The story of sugar in 5 objects", "author": "Tasha Marks, food historian", "timestamp": "2018-06-13 00:00:00", "text": "As someone with an unabashed sweet tooth, it seems fitting that my specialisms are in sugar, jelly and ice cream. However, the fun and frivolity of these foodstuffs is underpinned by the darker history of sugar. Sugar and status, possessions and power are intimately linked.\nIt\u2019s no secret that Sir Hans Sloane, whose collection founded the British Museum, was a slave owner whose sugar plantations in Jamaica contributed substantially to his ability to amass such a vast collection. Nearly every museum and gallery has connections to numerous plantation and slave holders. The association with slavery can taint these collections, but rather than banish them to the recesses of the archive, I think it is time to bring the conversation into the light and stop (for want of a better term) sugar coating this particular area of history. Sugar was a driving force and a catalyst to the slave trade, but also became an icon of change and a symbol of progress. In these 5 objects I hope to highlight some of the stories of sugar\u00a0\u2013 past, present and future\u2026\nWhere does sugar come from?\nThe presence of sugar was first acknowledged in England in the 12th century, where it was treated predominantly as a spice and a medicine. In this early period, sugar came from numerous sources in the Middle East, India, Egypt and beyond. Like many spices, Venice was the trading post by which sugar came into Europe. Harvested exclusively from sugar cane (sugar beet was not commercially used for sugar production until the 19th century) the resulting sugar was not in the famous \u2018sugar loaf\u2019 form, but more likely to be a gritty, gravel-like substance, made from drying sugar cane extract in the sun.\nAn illustration of sugar cane, 1544\u20131552.\nThe process of making sugar\nThe early refining process was soon replaced by the sugar loaf, or sugar cone, method. This technology for refining sugar cane was introduced to Europe in the 1400s, though it existed centuries earlier in the Middle East. In the print below we see the entire process, from the chopping down of sugar cane stems to the stone mill extracting the juice and the large stoves boiling syrup. Then on the right-hand side we see the moulding of the sugar cones, and finally the sugar loaves themselves. This is a plate from a series of 20 prints illustrating new inventions and discoveries, which was part of the initial bequest to the British Museum by Sir Hans Sloane himself.\n\u2018Saccharum\u2019 print showing the sugar production process, c. 1580\u20131605.\nSugar as artistic medium\nThe foundations of dessert as we know it were laid in the medieval \u2018void\u2019, when fruit, jelly and other sweetmeats were often eaten standing up and away from the dining hall, allowing the room to be cleared for after-dinner activities. This \u2018ceremony of the void\u2019 gave dessert a detached quality, setting it apart from other modes of feasting and allowing for a certain creative licence and flamboyance in its presentation.\nThe ceremony of the void evolved into the elaborate banquets of the Elizabethan age. Here the splendour of the dessert course was intensified by the costly nature of sugar, both in the intensive labour required for its intricate execution and the expense of the raw material itself. Sugar was not just a food, it was an artistic medium of tremendous flexibility. In the early modern period the use of sugar in Britain grew exponentially as its role as a status symbol in the feasts and rituals of the wealthy made it a powerful commodity. As usage became more widely spread, the forms and techniques of sugar work also became more important:\nInitially, the displays were important simply because they were both pretty and edible. But over time, the creative impulses of the confectioners were pressed into essentially political symbolic service, and the subtleties took on greater significance. \u2018Not only compliments,\u2019 writes one commentator, \u2018but even sly rebukes to heretics and politicians were conveyed in these sugared emblems.\u2019\nSweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History, Sidney W Mintz (1986)\nIllustration of an allegorical sculpture in sugar, 1687.\nThis power of sugar as a storyteller is seen in this illustration. It shows one of several sugar centrepieces included in a banquet offered by the Earl of Castlemaine on 14 January 1687, for James II. This elaborate sugar monument is not just visually alluring, but is also an allegorical sculpture representing the return of the nation into the Catholic Church.\nSugar and slavery\nThe fundamental image of 16th\u201319th-century sugar is not one of luxury, but of the horrors of slavery\u00a0\u2013 the transatlantic triangle that saw enslaved people treated as objects, and goods prized above people, was the direct outcome of the desire for affordable sugar. This history of sugar should never be forgotten, but addressed and engaged with. A recent BBC documentary revealed there were over 46,000 slave owners in the UK. These individuals ranged from those at the heart of government to middle-class tradesmen in the Orkney Islands. As a country, our participation in the slave trade was widespread, a fact that must not be neglected just because the enslaved people owned by these British proprietors were thousands of miles away on plantations in the Caribbean.\nAlthough the campaign for the Abolition of Slavery began in 1787, slavery persisted in the British colonies until its final abolition in 1838. The campaign harnessed political propaganda and hinged its argument on first-hand, eyewitness accounts. Proof that people in Africa were being captured and traded by Europeans, and taken to the Americas in appalling conditions was disturbing to many of the general public. While the average 18th-century person might not have had an impact on legislation, money can speak louder than words, and the shift from West India sugar produced by slaves to East India sugar, which was \u2018free-grown\u2019 is one of the first examples of how consumer choices could effect change.\nBlue glass sugar bowl, made around 1820\u20131830.\nAs seen in this sugar bowl, purchasing East India sugar became a badge of honour. Though more expensive than sugar produced by enslaved people, Georgian confectionery shops would advertise that they only used East India sugar to distance themselves from the slave trade. This action is as relevant today as it was then, marking a contemporary awareness and accountability for our consumer choices. In current consumer politics, as in the Georgian era, we should put our money where our mouth is. Free trade and fairly traded are not just words, they are a desire and an instigator for further change and equality.\nSugar sculpting today\nAs a confectioner and a food historian, I understand the historical significance of sugar as a status object. From medieval luxury, to the role of sugar in the slave trade, to the current anti-sugar rhetoric, our relationship with this foodstuff has been tumultuous. It\u2019s because of this turbulent history that I find sugar such a powerful medium. On a human level we will forever be drawn to the sweet stuff\u00a0\u2013 sweets are the things of childhood memories, of nostalgia and novelty. The intense private rituals of sweets mixed with the social and political history of the substance gives us new avenues to explore.\nThe nature of sugar as a transient medium holds potential for new uses as a storyteller. Sugar can decay but it can also act as a preservative, embalming things in time and space. New technology like 3D scanning and printing creates even more opportunities for sugar to interact with objects from the past. In my work I aim to draw together elements of the story of sugar, putting the spectacle back, like those Elizabethan banquets, but also asking people to think about their food, where it comes from and where it is going. Because, in the end, it\u2019s not the materials or the traditions that encourage change, but our craving for creativity and our desire to engage that drives us to a new sugar highs.\nSugar relief made from a 3D model of part of the Assyrian lion hunt reliefs.

It\u2019s said that beer was not invented but discovered, yet the manufacturing of beer was an active choice and the ancient Egyptians produced and consumed it in huge volumes.\nWhen I began this project, like many of my contemporaries I believed that ancient Egyptian beer would be revolting. I expected a thick, tasteless, gruel-like mixture that was mildly alcoholic. But the brewers on the team thought otherwise\u00a0\u2013 quite rightly they argued there was no way the Egyptians would be making beer in such quantities if it was not good. But to all of our surprise, it didn\u2019t just work, but it was absolutely delicious!\nUsing traditional methods and ingredients, we aimed to get as close as possible to a beer the ancient Egyptians would have drunk. Our research started in the British Museum, using objects in Rooms 62 and 63 to guide our initial research. We had further input from curators and physical anthropologists to focus our findings, and used archaeological reports and chemical analysis of pots to refine our method. We were also guided by an ancient Sumerian poem, the Hymn to Ninkasi (goddess of beer).\nOur contemporary ceramic vessel. Photo: Tasha Marks.\nSo, how is ancient Egyptian beer different from what we drink today?\nThe culture\nThen: In ancient Egypt, beer was so essential it was treated principally as a type of food\u00a0\u2013 it was consumed daily and in great quantities at religious festivals and celebrations. Beer was an essential for labourers, like those who built the pyramids of Giza, who were provided with a daily ration of 1\u2153 gallons (over 10 pints). Yet it still had divine status, with several gods and goddesses associated with beer. Hathor, the goddess of love, dance and beauty, was also known as \u2018The Lady of Drunkenness\u2019.\nNow: Beer is still very popular, but I wouldn\u2019t say it has \u2018divine status\u2019, and a liquid lunch is now a little frowned upon (especially if you are operating heavy machinery!)\nFemale figure with face of Hathor. From the Temple of Hathor, Faras, Nubia (in modern Sudan), 18th Dynasty (c. 1550\u20131292 BC).\nThe method\nThen: In the Museum\u2019s Egyptian galleries, you can see models excavated from tombs which show wooden figures of brewers straining mash through a cloth into ceramic vessels. This visual clue, alongside the research of Delwen Samuel, led us to use a two-stage mash, which we then left to ferment in a vessel containing a harvested yeast culture. The advantage of a two-stage mash is its simplicity. The cold mash is made using ambient temperature water and a malted, ground grain. This mash will contain all the active enzymes required to convert starch to sugar. The second mash, which is processed at the same time, consists of ground, unmalted grain. This is mixed with hot water and further heated.\nThere is evidence of heat exposure on ceramic brewing vessels found in Egypt. It is unlikely that earthenware would be heated above 80 degrees (as it would compromise the material), so this was the temperature to which we heated the hot portion of the mash. Heating grain to this temperature allows the starches present to unravel, but kills the enzymes. By preparing the two mixtures separately and then combining them, both the accessible starches and the enzymes required to convert them are present in the final mix.\nThe hot mash and the cold mash were mixed together and left to cool, so that the enzymes could start to convert the starches in the grains to fermentable sugars. When cool, the mash was sieved of any residual grain, directly into the terracotta fermenting vessel, which had been pre-inoculated with a harvested yeast strain. More warm water was used to rinse remaining starches and sugars form the grains. The vessel was covered with a muslin cloth and left to ferment. The resulting beer would have been drunk while still actively fermenting from the ceramic vessel itself.\nNow: In modern brewing all of the grain is processed together in a single mixture, within a very narrow temperature window. It is then boiled, which halts any further starch conversion. After which it is cooled and yeast is added. This process allows modern brewers to utilise up to 80\u201385% of the fermentable sugars. In our ancient Egyptian beer, because there was no boil, all of the starches were converted into sugars and the maximum end amount of alcohol was produced, making it 100% efficient.\nPainted wooden model of four figures preparing food and beer. From Sidmant, Egypt, 6th Dynasty (c. 2345\u20132181 BC).\nThe vessel\nThen: The ceramic vessel is key to the ancient Egyptian fermenting process, as its porous interior is the ideal surface for the wild yeast culture to grow. It is also cooler to the touch than the ambient temperature, which would be an obvious advantage to brewing in a hot arid climate. With this in mind, it was incredibly fortunate that the father of Michaela Charles (our excellent brewer) is a ceramicist! Inspired by objects in the British Museum\u2019s collection, David White was able to create a contemporary ceramic vessel for us in which to ferment the beer. In keeping with examples in the Museum, it was unglazed but was single fired to a higher level to reduce porosity. It had a wide, open mouth to allow air to circulate and encourage wild yeast to enter. The slight evaporation from its walls also cooled the fermentation.\nNow: Modern brewing almost exclusively happens in stainless steel, with wild or harvested yeast cultivation being discouraged in favour of single-strain brewer\u2019s yeast, added in a controlled environment.\nPottery beer jar. From Esna, Egypt, Second Intermediate Period (c. 1650\u20131550 BC).\nStraws\nThen: The beer was unlikely to have been decanted from many of these large ceramic vessels so a drinking straw was a must. Many academics believe the straw was to prevent sediment being consumed by the drinker. There is an element of that, however it\u2019s also likely to be about hygiene, as many people would have drunk from the same vessel \u2013\u00a0a bit like one of those fishbowl cocktails served in bars and clubs today.\nEgyptian straws would have been made from clay, with holes or a filter at the end to sieve out some of the sediment. These are several much later (early 20th century) examples in the Museum\u2019s collection made from reeds, which may also have been a likely material for ancient Egyptian straws.\nNow: You\u2019d probably be laughed out the pub if you used a straw to drink your pint.\nBeer-drinking straw made of reed. Zambia, 20th century.\nIngredients\nThen: The most noticeable absence in ancient Egyptian beer is hops, as these were not in use until the medieval period. The grain, too, is different, as ancient grain would have been higher in protein and predates modern varieties of wheat and barley. For our ancient Egyptian beer we used emmer, the earliest precursor to modern wheat. It was widely grown in the Fertile Crescent and has been identified by Delwen Samuel and her team on brewery excavations in the ancient workers\u2019 village of Amarna, built in 1350 BC.\nAlthough beer was not routinely made using dates or other flavourings, we decided to present a possible version of a royal brew. Spices and sweetness were a mark of status and I believe that the royal brewery would have been likely to create a more luxurious beer for its illustrious consumers. We paid a visit to the organic store at the British Museum, where we were able to see 5,000-year-old examples of emmer, barley, pomegranates, figs and other edible offerings. Inspired by the experience, we added an Egyptian-style spice mix called dukkah to the brew. Our blend consisted of rose petals, pistachios (the resin of which was also used in Egyptian embalming), sesame seeds, coriander and cumin seed. This is also influenced by the aromatic resins and garlands used in ancient Egyptian funeral preparations. We also tried adding dates, to further enrich the brew and help the wild yeast, as the sugars speed up the fermentation.\nNow: All modern beers are made with barley unless they specify otherwise. Hops are a near permanent feature, and flavourings are widespread and experimental. From Earl Grey tea to bacon, we love a flavoured beer \u2013 there\u2019s even one with snake\u2019s venom!\nBrownware pottery dish containing emmer wheat and barley.\nTo look back on it now, the Egyptian method makes a fool of modern brewers. We have added so many steps to improve on ancient methods, but our trial illustrates that ancient Egyptian beer ferments faster and is materially more efficient. Working without thermometers and starch tests, without the microbiology of yeast and enzyme conversion, the ancient Egyptian brewers created a crisp refreshing beer, that could have been made continuously in huge volumes.\nIt is amazing that one can look back and assume the ancient knowledge was lacking in some way. Perhaps there wasn\u2019t a need to store beer for long periods? Perhaps there was a perfectly good method of extending the shelf life of a beer that we have not found evidence of. But I think it is a mistake to look back into history and assume it was in more primitive or less extraordinary than what we can produce today.\nWatch the full process, meet the team and find out more about our experiment in the video:\nTasha Marks is a food historian, artist and the founder of AVM Curiosities.\nWith thanks to Michaela Charles, Head Brewer at the AlphaBeta Brewery, and Susan Boyle, Beer and Wine Consultant at Two Sisters Brewing.\nJoin Tasha, Susan and other guests from our Pleasant vices series at a special panel discussion on Friday 25 May to discover more delectable treats inspired by history and the Museum\u2019s collection."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/paint-and-the-parthenon-conservation-of-ancient-greek-sculpture/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Paint and the Parthenon: conservation of ancient Greek sculpture", "author": "Kasia Weglowska, Conservator: Stone, Wall Paintings and Mosaics", "timestamp": "2018-05-23 00:00:00", "text": "Since January 2018, I have been part of a team of conservators who have had the rare and wonderful opportunity to work on the Parthenon sculptures. In preparation for the exhibition Rodin and the art of ancient Greece\u00a0some of the sculptures became the subjects of an extensive scientific investigation.\u00a0By using non-invasive techniques such as visible-induced infrared luminescence (VIL) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF), we were able to examine the sculptures in great detail. In the process, we discovered more about them, helping us to understand how these magnificent works of art were made.\nFigures K, L and M from the east pediment of the Parthenon.\nWe began the process by moving the sculptures to the Stone, Wall Paintings and Mosaics Conservation Studio in the Museum\u2019s World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre, where we could take a much closer look at their surfaces.\nConservator performing cleaning tests on the Parthenon metope XXXI.\nThe first phase of conservation involved removing superficial dust and ingrained dirt. We started with a few cleaning tests to find the most efficient \u2013 but at the same time gentlest and safest \u2013 method of removing dirt, which can be visually disfiguring, but more importantly can also damage the objects. Because no two sculptures age in exactly the same way, we treated each one individually, continually evaluating our techniques and adjusting the treatment where necessary. This approach allowed us to carefully examine and document the condition of the sculptures and to gather as much information as possible about the carving techniques and the way the sculptures were painted.\nThe discovery of original pigments on the sculptures has been the most fascinating and exciting information revealed by the cleaning process so far. The debate on polchromy (painted colours used on ancient art) on the Parthenon sculptures started many years ago, and it is now known that both the architectural elements and sculptures would have been originally painted. Even so, it was not until now that the remnants of the pigments on them could be seen with the naked eye to such an extent.\nEgyptian blue visible on the figures L and M from the East pediment of the Parthenon.\nEgyptian blue\u00a0is possibly the earliest known synthetic pigment, first used by the ancient Egyptians, and later by Greeks and other ancient cultures. Traces of this pigment have been discovered on the figures of the goddesses K, L and M from the east pediment, and figure N from the west pediment. Most of them remained surprisingly vibrant and vivid, which makes them apparent to the naked eye. These are not the only examples that survive\u00a0\u2013 there are much larger areas where the pigment is visible, but only under certain light conditions.\nThe Museum first discovered traces of paint on the Parthenon sculptures in 2009 using a technique called visible-induced infrared luminescence (VIL).\u00a0VIL is a non-invasive technique developed by British Museum researcher Giovanni Verri. It allows detection of even the smallest remnants of\u00a0Egyptian blue. The technique uses the property of the pigment to absorb visible light (mostly red light) and re-emit infrared light, which can be then captured by a specially modified camera. This emission of light is known as luminescence.\nFigure K from the East pediment of the Parthenon (VIL).\nWe have employed the same technique in our recent conservation process, but the conservation studio provides a far more convenient space to look at the results. As such, we have another chance to add to this research and to learn more about the way the colour was used on the Parthenon sculptures. We were particularly delighted to find remnants of the pigment in the areas that were previously impossible to investigate, due to the way the sculptures were displayed.\nFigures L and M from the East pediment of the Parthenon. Left: visible light (VIS), right: visible-induced infrared luminescence (VIL). The bright white areas show the remnants of Egyptian blue.\nThe conservation process also allowed us to take a closer look at the way the sculptures were made. Despite the weathered surface, it is still possible to see some tool marks left by the sculptors, and even identify the tools, such as the rasp or claw chisel, which were used at different stages of carving or during the finishing process. The remarkably detailed and deep drapery was made possible with drills, the marks of which are still visible inside the channels and in undercuts.\nClose-up on tool marks visible on the surface of the figure K from the east pediment of the Parthenon.\nIn the exhibition, the sculptures are placed alongside a selection of Rodin\u2019s most famous works. Although Rodin never carved in marble himself, it is exciting to see his pieces alongside the Greek sculptures that inspired him. What would he have made of the scientific discoveries we have made?\nWorking with such iconic objects so closely \u2013 and being able to discover remnants of pigments which have not been seen for 2,000 years \u2013 has been a wonderful and fascinating experience, and a very rare privilege. It is one example of how the Museum\u2019s ongoing scientific research and conservation adds to our knowledge of objects, and helps preserve them for future generations.\nSee how Rodin was inspired by antiquity in the special exhibition\u00a0Rodin and the art of ancient Greece, on display from 26 April to 29 July 2018.\nSponsored by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nYou can find out more about the Parthenon sculptures in\u00a0this blog post\u00a0and discover\u00a010 things you may not have known about Rodin.\nYou can find out more about polychromy in the ancient world in this Tumblr post and more about Egyptian blue on the Parthenon sculptures in this video."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-18th-century-chocolate-champions/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "The 18th-century chocolate champions", "author": "Tasha Marks, food historian", "timestamp": "2018-05-18 00:00:00", "text": "When we think of chocolate, we tend to imagine it in its solid bar form. However, eating chocolate was not in regular production until the mid 19th century (following the invention of Conrad Van Houten\u2019s screw press in 1828). Chocolate was introduced to England around 1600, first and foremost as a drink, and remained popular in that form for over 200 years.\nThe 18th century was hot chocolate\u2019s heyday. The chocolate makers were intertwined with London\u2019s infamous coffeehouse culture, where the beverages were a catalyst for culture, politics and passions. At the coffeehouse you could get a fortifying hot drink, whether that be tea, coffee or chocolate, over which the day\u2019s events and possibilities would be played out.\nTrade card of Richard Haines, chocolate and cocoa dealer, 1765.\n18th-century hot chocolate was more bitter than our modern variations, but still intensely pleasant. Initially made with cocoa liquor (blocks of ground cocoa nibs) and water, it was popularly served with an equal mix of water and milk, spiced with ingredients including cinnamon, sugar, vanilla, chilli, rosewater, honey, pepper, jasmine or even ambergris.\nSir Hans Sloane, whose vast collection of objects became the founding collection of the British Museum, is believed to have been the first to combine milk with chocolate \u2013 though this is hotly debated. What is certain is that Sloane\u2019s name became synonymous with chocolate in the 18th century, with \u2018Sir Hans Sloane\u2019s Milk Chocolate\u2019 being a badge of honour for any chocolate dealer.\nTrade card of Edward & John White \u2018the only makers of Sir Hans Sloane\u2019s Milk Chocolate\u2019, around 1810.\nSloane developed an interest in the medicinal properties of chocolate while in Jamaica working as a physician in the 1680s, where he thought it a natural aid to digestion. As seen in this trade card for William White (below), the medicinal properties of chocolate were key to its marketing jargon, alongside Sloane\u2019s seal of approval. Not that I personally need much convincing, nor did the 18th-century public. These days the chocolate craze shows no sign of abiding, with the average UK resident found to have consumed over 8kg of chocolate in 2017.

Well, this post gives you just a few examples of the type of things you will see in the exhibition. From satirical prints to a \u2018pussyhat\u2019, it\u2019s an eclectic mix!\nPass the salt\nThe Stonyhurst Salt. Salt cellar made in 1577 in London for Catholic patrons.\nDuring the 16th-century English Reformation acts of Roman Catholic worship were banned. As such, shrines and reliquaries had to give the outward appearance that they were something else if they were to stand any chance of survival. Although it looks elaborate, this object \u2013 known as the Stonyhurst Salt \u2013 is at first glance a piece of secular tableware, a salt-cellar. However, it was made in the 1570s from silver-gilt decorated with rubies and rock crystal, taken from the recycled fragments of old reliquaries or church plate. As well as being made from religious objects, it contains further hidden Catholic messages. Rock crystal symbolised Christ\u2019s purity, and the garnets and rubies were probably intended to evoke drops of blood (perhaps of Christ or of Catholic martyrs). The Stonyhurst Salt is proof that people did manage to retrieve and save sacred items in defiance of the law.\nIan says:\nI can imagine the rich (and obviously Catholic) owners of this object saying to their guests, \u2018of course, Catholicism has been banned, we wouldn\u2019t dream of having such items of Catholic worship here. By the way, this is a salt-cellar \u2013 would you like some?\u2019\nIn the pink\nA \u2018pussyhat\u2019 worn by marchers for women\u2019s rights in 2017.\nOn 21 January 2017 protests were held worldwide in support of women\u2019s rights. Many of the marchers wore hand-knitted hats with pointed ends which looked like cat ears. These \u2018pussyhats\u2019 unified the marching millions and reclaimed a misogynistic term for female genitalia. The newly elected US President, Donald Trump, had used this word in a leaked recording when boasting about assaulting women. The exhibition will see the hat, newly acquired by the Museum, go on display for the first time.\nTrouble brewing\nBaluster teapot featuring the inscription \u2018Never forget the country\u2019s shame\u2019. China, 1931.\nThe decoration of tea wares in China is as old as the tradition of tea drinking, but their messages became increasingly politicised from the early 20th century. The image and inscription on this teapot lament the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. The design \u2013 a mountainous landscape with trees and a river \u2013 is a metaphor for continuity in the face of adversity. The inscription on the reverse says \u2018Never forget the country\u2019s shame\u2019.\nCarry on Cleo\nTerracotta oil lamp featuring a caricature of Cleopatra. Roman, c. AD 40\u201380.\nThis terracotta oil lamp shows a crocodile, the emblem of Egypt, with a phallus for a tail upon which sits a naked female, presumed to be Cleopatra. It was probably produced as part of one of the most successful propaganda campaigns in history, which was directed against Mark Antony and Cleopatra by supporters of Octavian (later the emperor Augustus) in the 30s BC. By the mid-30s BC Rome was awash with rumours of Antony and Cleopatra\u2019s alleged decadence. Octavian positioned himself as morally virtuous and publicly criticised his rival. Although this particular lamp was made in the 1st century AD, it strengthened Octavian\u2019s claim to be the legitimate successor to Julius Caesar at the expense of Antony, whose association with Cleopatra proved to be his undoing. Cleopatra\u2019s image was tarnished for thousands of years because of her relationships \u2013 a tale which still has resonance today.\nIan says:\nWhen I first saw this object I thought, \u2018that\u2019s a really strong attack on Cleopatra, who was an incredibly powerful figure\u2019. But actually, I fell into the trap, too. It was state-sanctioned ridicule, closer to propaganda. The future emperor Augustus and his supporters wanted to make her relationship with Antony seem as seedy as humanly possible.\nThick as a whale omelette\nJames Gillray (1756\u20131815), A voluptuary under the horrors of digestion. Hand-coloured etching, 1792.\nAttacks on gluttony, sexual amorality and reckless spending were as popular in late-Georgian satire as they are in cartoons today. Here master caricaturist James Gillray (1756\u20131815) launches a savage attack on George, Prince of Wales (the future George IV, r. 1820\u20131830). At first glance this appears to be a respectful portrait. On closer inspection he is revealed to be an obese and uncouth man with stinking breath and a love of banqueting, booze and women. Treatments for sexually transmitted diseases clutter the sideboard, while the unfinished buildings outside allude to his debts. Hopeless with money, the prince had to be repeatedly bailed out by the government.\nBone of contention\nDay of the Dead figure of a factory owner by Pablo Morales, Mexico, 1980s.\nThis papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 figure of a \u2018fat cat\u2019 factory owner was made for Mexican Day of the Dead parades in the mid-1980s. In its modern incarnation, as well as commemorating departed loved ones, the Day of the Dead portrays a \u2018world turned upside down\u2019, particularly the subversion of traditional hierarchies, the mockery of authority figures and class-based commentaries. The subjects made into papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 figures are chosen to reflect both contemporary politics and local concerns \u2013 this skeleton caricature of a corrupt factory owner enjoys immense wealth while his poorly paid workers toil away in appalling conditions.\nSpot the hidden message\nRaffia cloth with a leopard and a proverb in French. Democratic Republic of Congo, 1970s\u20131990.\nRaffia cloths of this type are commonly woven into clothing in the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, this hand-woven raffia cloth was probably made for the interior of someone\u2019s house rather than worn as clothing. The French inscription \u2013 translated as \u2018The skin of the leopard is beautiful, but inside it is war\u2019 \u2013 is a Congolese proverb, probably a veiled criticism of the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko who ruled from 1965 to 1997. Mobutu adopted leopard imagery as symbol of his style of \u2018warrior\u2019 rule, wearing a distinctive leopard-skin hat.\nNot giving a hoot\nHuang Yongyu (b. 1924), Two Owls. Ink painting on paper, 1977.\nThis is a story of an artist being accused of dissent in a work that may or may not have been created with subversive intent. In Chinese culture the owl is sometimes regarded as a creature of darkness and ill omen. In 1973, a painting of a winking owl landed artist Huang Yongyu in trouble. Interpreted as a comment on the declining health of China\u2019s leader, Chairman Mao, Huang was charged with blaspheming the state. While he was interrogated, the painting was exhibited in a display of censored art in Beijing \u2013 as a warning of what was unacceptable. Although eventually acquitted, Huang\u2019s persecution effectively turned him into a dissident. After he was exonerated, Huang protested by painting these two owls. The inscription on this new painting says he did not intend the original owl to have a hidden meaning. But it also refers to the organiser of the censored art exhibition who had committed suicide \u2013 saying that perhaps the owls were a bad omen, for her\u2026 The artist goes on to say, \u2018fate makes fun of man in a bizarre way\u2019.\nThe Citi exhibition I object: Ian Hislop\u2019s search for dissent runs from 6 September 2018 to 20 January 2019.\nSupported by Citi.\nThe accompanying three-part BBC Radio 4 series will be broadcast from 11 August 2018.\nFind out more about the exhibition and book your tickets today to take advantage of the special \u2018early bird\u2019 rate of \u00a310."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/new-special-exhibition-on-dissent-announced/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "New special exhibition on dissent announced", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2018-05-16 00:00:00", "text": "We are pleased to announce our special autumn show \u2013 the Citi exhibition I object: Ian Hislop\u2019s search for dissent, which will run from 6 September 2018 to 20 January 2019.\nHistory, as somebody wise once said, is just one damned thing after another. But is it really? Who decides what is \u2018history\u2019? Traditionally, the answer is \u2018the winners\u2019. But in this exhibition we\u2019re investigating what the other people had to say. They left their marks on objects too \u2013 you just need to know where to look\u2026\nThis is a fresh look at the collection that turns up a treasure trove of dissent in the midst of the conformity. From the ancient civilisations through to our own, there are extraordinary objects that bear witness to someone questioning the authorised version of their times and deciding to make a small though often lasting protest.\nIan Hislop\nThe intriguing and eclectic objects have been hand-selected by Ian Hislop, who is the exhibition\u2019s co-curator. His diverse choices are drawn from all parts of the British Museum\u2019s eight-million strong collection, and include everyday items alongside finely crafted works of art. Together, these objects span three millennia, charting all corners of the globe, and demonstrate that the desire to rebel is universal.\nCo-curators Ian Hislop and Tom Hockenhull take a rummage in the stores, posing for what will undoubtedly feature in a future caption competition.\nIan will take you on a journey through the Museum\u2019s collection. With his journalist\u2019s eye for the untold story, he uncovers history\u2019s underdogs, and bears witness to their often buried stories. At every turn these objects call into question the popular beliefs of the time, ridicule those in power and raise an eyebrow at the notion of \u2018official\u2019 history.\nAt first sight the British Museum seems to be a reinforcement, if not a celebration, of authority \u2013 of history\u2019s rulers and their artefacts. I wanted to find out whether there were objects in the Museum that challenged the official version of events, that dissented from established narratives and that presented different points of view. Was there any subversive material lurking among the mummies and the monuments? The answer, fortunately, was \u2018yes\u2019.\nIan Hislop\nAs an institution seen to represent \u2018official\u2019 history, the British Museum also gets its fair share of scrutiny and ridicule in the exhibition, nowhere more so than in an artwork created by Banksy. The hoax piece Peckham Rock returns to the Museum 13 years after the anonymous graffiti artist installed it, without permission, in one of our galleries. It shows a stick-like figure pushing a shopping trolley, and was accompanied by a mock information label with a fake museum registration number. Having been \u2018on loan from the British Museum\u2019 for displays in London and Bristol, this exhibition marks the artwork\u2019s return to its original home as it goes back on display, this time \u2018officially\u2019.\nBanksymus Maximus AKA Banksy (b. 1974), Peckham Rock. Site-specific uncommissioned guerrilla installation for Room 49 of the British Museum. Mixed media and general cheek, 2005. \u00a9 the artist, whoever he is\u2026\nThis is a very neat example of dissent at the expense of the British Museum itself. Not only does it mock the pomposity of the whole process of collecting and exhibiting old artefacts, but it also suggests that you can stick anything in the Museum and no one will even notice for days. Very funny \u2013 though I am not entirely sure the Museum thought so at the time.\nIan Hislop\nThe exhibition shows that ridicule has been used as a form of rebellion since history began \u2013 to devastating effect. Political opponents throughout time were portrayed as weak, disrespectful of tradition and irresponsible, and one of the oldest objects in the exhibition does just that. It is a cuneiform tablet catchily known as the Verse Account of Nabonidus, after the last king of the Neo-Babylonian empire. It features a propaganda poem, an early recorded example of political slander, of the blasphemies and failures of Nabonidus. The invading Persian king Cyrus wanted to convince the local population that, although he was a foreigner, he respected Babylonian customs better than Nabonidus. Nabonidus\u2019 fate is unknown, but unless he managed to escape into exile he was probably put to death.\nCuneiform tablet featuring the Verse Account of Nabonidus, praising Cyrus the Great. Babylon, c. 539 BC\nAs well as the use of objects to oppress, their role as agents for change is also a key theme in the exhibition. This is most clear in objects such as this penny, which was anonymously defaced between 1913 and 1914 by suffragettes at the height of their (ultimately successful) campaign to demand votes for women.\nPenny of Edward VII defaced around 1913 to promote the suffragette cause. This bold criminal act was one of many that catapulted the movement for women\u2019s right to vote into the political limelight.\nIn the centenary year of (some) women getting the vote, it seems apt to have an exhibition that opens up the conversation around those who challenged, and continue to challenge, the status quo in order to change the world. Continuing in this spirit is one of the Museum\u2019s most recent acquisitions, a \u2018pussyhat\u2019. The pink knitted hat was worn in Washington DC on 21 January 2017 on a march demonstrating against the newly elected President Trump, which went on to become a global movement.

But these delicious foods are probably the least interesting aphrodisiacs I have come across.\nThough the use of aphrodisiacs goes back millennia, historically they were seen first and foremost as a cure of infertility \u2013 less about titillation and more about the task at hand. In the early modern period, lust and fertility were seen as inextricably linked, with pleasure integral to conception, making aphrodisiacs both functional and recreational. Aphrodisiacs were more than just sexual curiosities, they were a crucial element in the struggle for fertility.\nIt is a bonus that food floods the brain with endorphins causing people to feel more relaxed, happy, and perhaps more sexy. If you\u2019ve ever factored a date\u2019s restaurant choice or cooking skills into your decision to go to bed with them then you\u2019ve experienced the aphrodisiac qualities of food. Cooking and eating are sensual activities\u00a0\u2013 they stimulate smell, sight, taste, touch and sound. So here\u2019s my top 5 historical aphrodisiacs, although you might not always want a second helping\u2026\n1. Beans\nEarly modern medical discourse was dominated by the ancient concept that the body was made up of four humours (blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm) existing in a delicate balance. The differing levels of these humours within a person created their individual constitution. Aphrodisiacs that warmed the body added fuel to the fire of sexual desire and counteracted frigidity, which was recognised as a common cause of infertility \u2013 the barren woman was cold.\nBut equally, too much heat could destroy your seed. One group of foods that you might be prescribed if you were overly hot was \u2018windy meats\u2019 aka beans and peas. Windy meats were prescribed for men in particular, who were considered to have a hot constitution. Windy meats were recommended as they thought an erection was caused by pressure and wind inflating the penis, hence flatulent foods. But personally I don\u2019t see how farting in bed could be seen as erotic\u2026\nA heap of beans is shown in this 1592 print by Jacob Hoefnagel.\n2. Vanilla\nVanilla is an inherently romantic plant\u00a0\u2013 its small blossoms open in the morning and are exclusively pollinated by hummingbirds and bees. The Spanish Conquistadors noted the pod\u2019s resemblance to female genitalia, and gave the plant the name vanilla, which is derived from the Latin for sheath. Europeans soon prized vanilla as an aphrodisiac, with wild stories circulating that vanilla could transform the ordinary man into an astonishing lover. Elizabeth I is said to have been especially fond of vanilla pudding.\nStudies of vanilla beans and pods, drawn by Nicolas Robert (1625\u20131684).\n3. Genitalia\nA very influential medical theory during the Renaissance was that after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden, God mercifully gave each plant a visible sign, usually in resemblance to a part of the human body it could be used to treat. Walnuts for the brain, kidney beans for the kidneys, and so forth. Therefore it made sense that plants and herbs that resembled genitalia would be aphrodisiacs\u00a0\u2013 you have the asparagus and carrot to represent man vs. the oyster and strawberry for a lady.\nFailing that, you could bypass flora and go straight for the fauna. With animal genitalia believed to be imbued with a primal sexual vitality, they made for excellent aphrodisiacs. However, if stag\u2019s penis is not to your taste, the British Museum\u2019s collection contains many votive and amulet penises which embody the same principle of sexual vigour and prowess.\nA bronze phallus amulet from around 1700, and a\u00a019th-century gold phallus pendant.\n4. Chocolate\nChocolate was first regarded as an aphrodisiac by the Aztecs who thought it invigorated men and made women less inhibited. Their emperor\u00a0Moctezuma reputedly drank it 50 times a day from a golden goblet, and is quoted referring to chocolate as: \u2018The divine drink, which builds up resistance and fights fatigue. A cup of this precious drink permits a man to walk for a whole day without food.\u2019\nChocolate was also very popular in 18th-century Europe, where it was so esteemed for its amorous properties that at one point monks were forbidden to drink it. In A History of the Nature and Quality of Chocolate, James Wadsworth wrote: \u2018Twill make Old Women Young and Fresh; Create New Motions of the Flesh, and Cause them to long for you know what, If they but taste of chocolate.\u2019\nThe notorious 18th-century Italian author Casanova also mentions chocolate in his memoirs, frequently discussing his habit of consuming cups of chocolate in order to sustain his lustful exploits. One particular recipe associated with Casanova is a chocolate cream infused with ambergris and vanilla, two of my other top 5, and a rather pleasant sounding concoction.\nPortrait of Giacomo Casanova etched by J Berka in the 19th century.\n5. Ambergris\nAmbergris comes from the stomach of a sperm whale, which is why it\u2019s often lovingly referred to as \u2018whale vomit\u2019. I like to think of it more as an oceanic truffle. Made from partially digested squid beaks, this mass builds up in the whale\u2019s stomach, before being expelled, one way or another, and spending months, maybe years, at sea, maturing into one of the most expensive ingredients on the planet.\nBut why is this an aphrodisiac, I hear you cry? Well, rare and unusual things are instilled with a sort of mythical power, and ambergris is certainly a weird and wonderful object. It appears as an ingredient in numerous medical texts (Bonet 1686, Dufour 1685 and Stubbe 1662, to name just a few). Not much to look at, it has a powerful musky aroma and works as a fixative, making it a key ingredient in historical perfumes. It also makes for an interesting garnish, with Casanova mixing it into his chocolate cream, Elizabeth I wearing it around her neck in a pomander, and Charles I even grating it onto his eggs at breakfast!\nSample of ambergris acquired from Oman in 1985.\nFor more examples of historical aphrodisiacs, and a delicious recipe from the Islamic world, watch the first episode of our Pleasant vices series:\nWith thanks to Dr Jennifer Evans, Senior Lecturer in History, University of Hertfordshire, whose book Aphrodisiacs, Fertility and Medicine in Early Modern England was a key factual source for this post.\nTasha Marks is a food historian, artist and founder of AVM Curiosities.

All these sounds are in praise of a deity \u2013 and show how music, all over the world, is used to elevate us from earthly concerns and take us to higher spheres.\nIn November 2017 the Academy of Ancient Music and Tenebrae performed Bach\u2019s Mass in B Minor in the Museum\u2019s Parthenon Gallery.\nAs editor-in-chief of Songlines, the world music magazine, I regularly hear music in all corners of the globe. As well as for worship, it\u2019s used universally for public occasions like ceremonies and celebration, and for the personal, like seduction and consolation. One can also add inspiring and healing, dancing and dozing, protesting and waiting to the list \u2013 although telephone \u2018hold\u2019 music is hardly the height of the art.\nIt\u2019s often said that music is a universal language. I don\u2019t fully agree, but music is universally used because it inspires and elevates us. Music affects us physically, through vibrations, over a defined period of time, which isn\u2019t the case with the written word or visual arts. So music somehow moves us even if we don\u2019t understand the musical or spoken language. In its physical and temporal presence music is close to universal.\nFlamenco singer Arc\u00e1ngel will perform with Baroque ensemble Accademia del Piacere, highlighting the musical links between Spain and the colonial Americas. Photo: Javier Salas.\nMusic is, of course, a cultural expression and a country\u2019s history is written into its music, just as with its cuisine or art. Because of the transatlantic slave trade, Cuban music is a mixture of indigenous, Hispanic and Black African sounds. The same goes for music across the Caribbean, with the ingredients varying from place to place.\nMusic might be universal, but it sure sounds different in different areas of the world. And most people can probably identify music that is Indian, Brazilian or American \u2013 not just from the language, but from the sound and texture of the music. The more you hear, the easier it gets. But if music is played everywhere, what\u2019s it for?\nFragment of a wall painting from the tomb of Nebamun showing musicians and dancers at a banquet. Thebes, Egypt, c. 1350 BC.\nLook at the paintings in the British Museum from the tomb of Nebamun, painted in ancient Egypt around 1350 BC. These include female musicians at a banquet singing, clapping and playing a double flute, and two female dancers with their bodies entwined. Along from them there\u2019s another group playing lutes and flutes. The pictures are so naturalistic that you can almost hear the sound of the music they\u2019re making. Some of the musicians stare out at us and are not just seen in profile, their frizzy hair cascades onto their shoulders. The music is part of the sheer pleasure of the occasion.\nFragment of a wall painting from the tomb of Nebamun showing musicians playing lutes and flutes. Thebes, Egypt, c. 1350 BC.\nThe style is in vivid contrast to the paintings of the pharaohs\u2019 tombs in the Valley of the Kings with their spells for the afterlife. Nebamun was an official, not a pharaoh, and the tombs of ordinary people can give a much more human picture of life in Egypt 3,400 years ago. Whether it\u2019s real life or an imagined afterlife that is depicted, we can identify with these scenes of music and dancing girls. This was made clear to me when I saw the dancers reproduced on the stage of a bellydance club in Cairo a few years ago.\nSimsimiyya player Waziry in Port Said. \u00a9 Simon Broughton.\nAlso in Egypt, I met a wonderful musician called Waziry in Port Said, who played the simsimiyya, a simple but beautiful lyre that goes back thousands of years. It\u2019s actually the sort of lyre that Apollo, Greek god of music and arts, is said to have played, taking us back to earlier ideas of music. Proof of this is in the Museum with the very same instrument found in Athens dating from the 5th century BC. Waziry\u2019s lyre was made of an enamel dish tied to a wooden frame, while the Greek example uses a tortoise shell, but the instrument is otherwise identical, one with five, the other with seven strings.\nA Greek lyre reconstructed from remains. Probably 5th\u20134th century BC.\nOver thousands of years of history and across the globe, music makes a party. A wedding is one of life\u2019s biggest parties and everywhere people celebrate them with music \u2013 unless they are forced not to. In Afghanistan, the Taliban banned all music, except for chants in praise of themselves. After their fall, I went to a wedding in Kabul where one of the guests said \u2018Two months ago we couldn\u2019t play music and now we can. There is a big difference between a wedding that has music and a wedding without music.\u2019 You can say that again, and in Kabul, after a six-year ban, most people felt a tangible need to celebrate.\nA\u00efcha Redouane. Photo: H Hmima.\nIn many parts of the Islamic world Sufi music and poetry is seen as a way of getting closer to God. The global popularity of Pakistani qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Al Khan demonstrated the power of this music to break out of its religious confines and reach festival audiences. His qawwali successors like Faiz Ali Faiz and Rizwan Muazzam Qawwali, along with the extraordinary Pakistani vocalist Abida Parveen, demonstrate the international power of this music. In the Museum\u2019s festival\u00a0Europe and the world, Moroccan-born A\u00efcha Redouane brings classical Arabic and Sufi songs from Egypt on a rare visit to the UK.\nThroughout history music has been essential for national celebrations, royal and political events. Think of Handel\u2019s Water Music (1717) for George I and his Music for the Royal Fireworks (1749) for George II, the magnificent xylophone playing at the Buganda Court in Uganda, performances by Bruce Springsteen, Yo-Yo Ma and Stevie Wonder at President Obama\u2019s Inauguration in 2009, and shows by Angelique Kidjo, Elton John, Hugh Masekela and Justin Bieber for the opening of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Music raises the spirits and brings grandeur to a big occasion.\nReigakusha Ensemble.\nThe oldest form of \u2018orchestral\u2019 music still played is gagaku, a Japanese court music dating back to the 7th century. It\u2019s rarely heard outside Japan, so the visit of the Reigakusha Ensemble to London is a notable event. To 21st century ears, the music sounds strangely austere and it\u2019s hard to imagine what sort of ceremonies it might have accompanied. But the musical form came from China, along with Buddhism, and it\u2019s known that gagaku music was played for the celebration of a monumental bronze statue of the Buddha in AD 749. The dominant sound is of wind instruments \u2013 flutes, oboes and bamboo mouth organs \u2013 but there are also lutes, koto zithers and a drum that leads the ensemble. The music has a strange beauty, but it does sound like something from another age.\nSitar of Pandit Ravi Shankar (1920\u20132012). Commissioned by Shankar from the instrument maker Nodu Mullick in Calcutta. Made in 1961. The sitar is on display in Room 33.\nIn the west there\u2019s often been a pretty clear dividing line between religious and secular music. Hymns, plainchant, spirituals, oratorios are religious, whereas love songs, symphonies and dance tracks are secular. In Indian music, the dividing line is rather more blurred. The late Ravi Shankar said that playing a classical sitar recital was an act of devotion \u2013 not surprisingly after he\u2019d spent six years of intense tuition with his guru Allauddin Khan in the early 1940s. \u2018I used to get up very early in the morning, practice for a few hours, then have a little breakfast, bathe and go to him for three or four hours training\u2019, Shankar told me. \u2018I\u2019d rest a little and then I\u2019d practice all afternoon, so I was doing about 14 hours a day. But it took me six months to get into that groove.\u2019\nKaushiki Chakraborty. \u00a9 Avishek Dey.\nThat sort of dedication now perhaps belongs to another age. While today\u2019s artists are rarely playing sitar till their fingers bleed or singing till they drop, there are younger performers still serious about their art. One is khayal singer Kaushiki Chakraborty. Khayal literally means \u2018imagination\u2019 and it\u2019s an art, learnt from her father, that requires extensive musical knowledge and vocal dexterity, but also the ability to improvise musical phrases on the spot.\nChakraborty told Songlines magazine, \u2018it needs the poise and peace of the middle of the sea, it needs the force of a waterfall, it needs the soft and crisp feeling of rain, it needs the grandeur and majesty of giant waves\u2026 it needs everything that a musical form can possibly accommodate.\u2019\nThe Sir Joseph Hotung Gallery of China and South Asia will be the venue for several performances during the festival. You can see some of the Amaravati sculpture in the background of this image.\nKhayal became popular in the 18th century, quite recently compared to many Indian forms. But like many other genres from the subcontinent it can be sacred or secular, or even both at the same time. In the British Museum it will be heard in a glorious setting in front of sculptures from the Great Shrine at Amaravati, a Buddhist monument in stone carved with secular scenes from the life of the Buddha. Ravi Shankar\u2019s sitar is also to be found in the same gallery. It\u2019s thanks to musicians like him and Kaushiki Chakraborty that classical Indian music like this can still live and speak to audiences today.\nEurope and the world: a symphony of cultures\u00a0takes place from 16\u201329 April 2018.

The galleries will be filled with the sound of music from across the world, from classical traditional Indian music and Chinese kunqu opera to 20th-century European avant-garde works by composers such as Stockhausen, Berio and Ligeti. With these unique performances taking place surrounded by objects in the collection, our curators have orchestrated this list of 15 musical instruments from around the world and across time.\n1.\u00a0Mesopotamian lyre\nSilver lyre. Royal Cemetery of Ur, now in southern Iraq, 2600 BC.\nThis imposing silver lyre was played in Mesopotamia (modern-day southern Iraq) over 4,000 years ago. Music was an important aspect of many celebratory and ritual occasions in ancient Mesopotamia. The lyre is made of lavishly decorated silver and red limestone. The frame, tuners and strings are modern reproductions made from casts of the long-decayed wooden parts. The decorated panels below the bull\u2019s head depict fallow deer and a tree on a hill, lions attacking a goat, and a lion attacking a gazelle.\n2. Medieval citole\nCitole made of wood, silver and gold. England, c. 1280\u20131330.\nThis richly decorated instrument, dripping with carved foliage, has an interesting story. It was originally made between 1280 and 1330 as a citole, a medieval guitar-like instrument, usually with four strings. This one is intriguing as it was converted into a violin at some point \u2013 possibly during the 16th century or later when the violin was becoming more fashionable. The coats of arms of Queen Elizabeth I and her alleged lover Robert Dudley appear on the silver plate at the headstock.\n3. Ancient Egyptian harp\nArched wooden harp. Tomb of Ani, Thebes, Egypt, New Kingdom (c. 1550\u20131070 BC).\nHarps like this highly decorated example were played at ancient Egyptian banquets \u2013 they\u2019re often shown in scenes covering the walls of tombs. This one was found in a tomb and is over 3,000 years old. The strings were plucked two at a time, and depictions of harps show they could be accompanied by singers and instruments that resemble lutes and oboes. Songs at banquets were usually dedicated to deities.\n4. Arabian lute\nArabian lute made of cedar, Indian rosewood, ebony and bone. Basra, Iraq, 1981.\nThis Arabian lute (oud in Arabic) was made by the famous Iraqi luthier Fawzi Monshid of Basra in 1981. The cedar wood soundboard has decorative details in ebony, rosewood and bone and the belly is made of strips of north Indian rosewood.\u00a0This beautiful instrument has been synonymous with the music of the Middle East for centuries, and the word \u2018lute\u2019 originally comes from a corruption of the Arabic al-oud. This magnificent example will go on display in the Museum\u2019s new Albukhary Foundation Galleries of the Islamic world, due to open in October 2018, where you will be able to hear a recording of it played by the London-based master Ahmed Mukhtar.\n5.\u00a0Statue of a woman playing a lyre from Cyprus\nLimestone statue of a female worshipper playing a lyre. Cyprus, 300\u2013250 BC.\nThis limestone statue of a woman playing a lyre was dedicated in a shrine in ancient Cyprus around 300\u2013250 BC to entertain and honour the gods for eternity. This type of statue represents high status women who took part in major religious festivals as priestesses. The dress and jewellery indicate that she was a member of the upper classes, while her wreath signifies that she is a worshipper. The strings of the lyre are still faintly visible in red paint \u2013 this whole statue was most likely painted.\n6.\u00a0A satirical print of a celebrated performer\nGeorge Cruikshank (1792\u20131878), A celebrated performer in the philharmonic society. Hand-coloured etching, 10 May 1818.\nThis satirical print made by George Cruikshank is a portrait of a violinist, thought to be P Spagnoletti (1768\u20131834). He was the leader of the orchestra at the King\u2019s Theatre (Opera) for nearly 30 years, and one of the first Associates of the Philharmonic Society founded in 1813. The violin forms the performer\u2019s face and the sound-holes create the eyes and nose.\n7. A Roman water-organ\nA water-organ (hydraulis) on a Roman bronze medallion, 4th\u20135th century AD.\nInvented in the 3rd century BC, the water-organ (hydraulis) was the most elaborate musical instrument of classical antiquity. Here, the seated musician is shown turned towards his audience with his back to the pipes. When played, assistants were needed to work the long-handled pumps seen either side to keep up water pressure in a tank forcing up air through keys and into the pipes. Roman art sometimes shows organs accompanying gladiator combat \u2013 a bloodthirsty purpose compared to their long subsequent association with churches.\n8. Chinese flute\nPorcelain flute with gilt decoration and transparent glaze and silk tassel. Dehua, Fujian province, Qing dynasty, about AD 1800\u20131900. On loan from the Sir Percival David Collection.\nDehua wares of the period AD 1600\u20131911 are typified by figures and vessels with a granular sugary white body and either a blue-tinged or creamy glaze. The pure whiteness of these ceramics is due to the relative absence of iron impurities in the body \u2013 indeed the clay used contains only half a percent of ferric oxide. This flute has the character\u00a0\u6e05 (Qing, meaning pure) in the mouthpiece.\n9.\u00a0Jewish shofar\nJewish shofar. Europe, 18th\u201319th century.\nThis musical instrument is made from a ram\u2019s horn, and today it is used mainly in synagogue services during the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah (New Year) and Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement). It has a distinctive sound, and is blown following an elaborate order of sounds and notes. The custom of sounding a shofar on ceremonial occasions originated in biblical times. It is first mentioned in the Book of Exodus when God revealed himself at Mount Sinai and the sound of the shofar made the Israelites tremble in awe.\n10.\u00a0Ancient Greek wooden pipes\nWooden auloi (pipes). Said to be from Athens, 5th\u20134th century BC.\nWhenever people came together in ancient Greece, there was likely to be some form of musical accompaniment. There were joyful songs to celebrate marriage and childbirth, sad lamentation after death, work-songs for harvesting, grinding grain and weaving, drinking songs, love songs and even songs for curing illness. Auloi are pipes made of wood, bone or metal blown through a reed inserted into the end, and were often played in pairs. They were used as the musical accompaniment in Greek theatre.\n11.\u00a0Tibetan trumpet\nConch shell trumpet. Tibet, 18th\u201319th century.\nTrumpets like this were used in Buddhist\u00a0temples\u00a0across Asia, blown to call monks to services, and were usually decorated with textile streamers. This large example is made from a conch shell and decorated with gilt-copper and semi-precious stones. A very lively dragon stands in contrast against the background of clouds indicated by lapis lazuli, with its body inlaid with coral and other semi-precious stones.\n12.\u00a0S\u00e1mi drum\nS\u00e1mi drum. Norway, Sweden or Finland, 1500\u2013c. 1680.\nMade of wood and reindeer skin, drums like this were an important tool for survival for the S\u00e1mi people, whose homeland covers parts of northern Norway,\u00a0Sweden, Finland, as well as the Kola Peninsula in Russia. These drums were magical weapons that, in the hands of a shaman, or noaidi, could help to protect the community. In front of a flickering fire, the noaidi would beat the drum rhythmically, using the sound\u00a0like a drug to enter a trance. Magic drums were used by S\u00e1mi for\u00a0 many generations, and this may be among the oldest surviving examples.\n13.\u00a0Akan drum\nAkan drum. Made in Ghana, 18th century.\nThis drum is one of the earliest surviving African-American objects. It was made by the Akan people of Ghana in West Africa and constructed from wood, vegetable fibre and deer skin. It would have been played at religious ceremonies or social occasions as part of an ensemble, and hit with an open hand. It was probably brought to America on a slave ship in the early 18th century, arriving in Virginia. Despite the oppression of slavery, drumming and other African musical traditions continued in colonial America, giving rise to many different kinds of music.\n14.\u00a0An Indonesian metallophone\nMetallophone (saron). Java, Indonesia, late 18th century\u2013early 19th century.\nA saron\u00a0is an Indonesian metallophone with seven bronze keys on top of a wooden frame. It is played with a mallet made of wood or buffalo horn.\u00a0Predominantly used in Java and Bali, the instrument is part of a larger orchestral ensemble known as a\u00a0gamelan. An integral part of Indonesian culture, gamelans normally accompany dance and puppet (wayang)\u00a0performances, rituals and ceremonies.\n15. Rattle from ancient Cyprus\nTerracotta rattle in the shape of a pig. Cyprus, 300\u2013100 BC.\nThis adorably cute pig-shaped rattle from ancient Cyprus dates from around 300\u2013100 BC. Made from terracotta, it may have been used to keep the beat in music or dance, or to scare off evil spirits with its rattling sound. It could also have been a toy, as a few examples have been found in children\u2019s graves.\nEurope and the world: a symphony of cultures takes place from 16\u201329 April 2018. The performances will be accompanied by a series of panel discussions that will explore the role of museums in complex political times, as places to listen, to debate and to experience music.\nShare your thoughts and experiences of the festival using #BMmusicfestival.\nThis festival is organised by the British Museum and the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden and made possible by the Federal Foreign Office of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nIn association with BBC Radio 3."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-worlds-oldest-bridge-is-being-preserved-in-iraq/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "The world's oldest bridge is being preserved in Iraq", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "text": "The bridge at Tello was built in the third millennium BC, making it the oldest bridge still in existence.

The new visitor centre will explain in both English and Arabic how the bridge has contributed to world history, and tour groups from outside Iraq could begin to visit the site by 2020.\nBuilt for the ancient Sumerian city of Girsu, the bridge was only rediscovered in 1929. Described at the time as an \u2018enigmatic construction\u2019, it has been variously interpreted as a temple, dam and water regulator. Recent studies using 1930s photographs as well as recently declassified satellite imagery from the 1960s, alongside new research at the site, have confirmed that it was a bridge over an ancient waterway and that it is (at the time of writing) the earliest-known bridge in the world. Since the excavations nearly 90 years ago, the bridge has remained open and exposed, with no identifiable conservation work to address its long-term stability or issues of erosion, and no plans to manage the site or tell its story to the wider world.\nFieldwork at Tello.\nThe need to protect the bridge arose from preliminary work by the first two Iraq Scheme excavation seasons. The preliminary assessment stressed the urgency of carrying out a larger and more ambitious conservation programme, including emergency excavations. Even during this early phase, two trenches were uncovered, containing well-preserved deposits of the prehistoric Ubaid period dating to the fifth millennium BC. These contain a wealth of information on the origins of Girsu and, consequently, the birth of urban centres in Mesopotamia, one of the earliest known civilisations. This would improve international recognition of the rich and important heritage of Iraq.\nThe next group of Iraq Scheme participants that will carry out this vital work are eight female heritage professionals from the Mosul region. They will arrive in London this month to train at the British Museum in all aspects of archaeological fieldwork and emergency archaeology. Their future work will continue the success of the Scheme so far \u2013 for example, one graduate has been appointed by the Iraqi State Board to lead the assessment of the site of Nimrud.\nThe archaeological team at Tello.\nThis is a hugely important project to ensure the long-term sustainability of the world\u2019s oldest bridge, which is an incredibly clever piece of ancient engineering on a grand scale. The full conservation programme will not only provide access to the site for the local community and tourists, but it is hoped that it could yield unprecedented finds that may lead to a new cultural centre of interest in the region \u2013 one of the poorest provinces of Iraq.\nThis is an important emblem of Iraq\u2019s heritage and restoring the bridge is a symbol of a brighter future for the Iraqi people.\nYou can find out more about the\u00a0Iraq Emergency Heritage Management Training Scheme on the Museum\u2019s website."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/trade-and-contraband-in-ancient-assyria/", "category": "Curator's corner", "title": "Trade and contraband in ancient Assyria", "author": "Mathilde Touillon-Ricci, Collaborative Doctoral Award Researcher, Department of the Middle East", "timestamp": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "Whenever I am asked what I do for a living, I have to confess: I read people\u2019s private papers. In my defence, I have to say that any secrecy on these papers was lifted a few thousand years ago. These are not even made of paper but were shaped out of clay 4,000 years ago by travelling merchants along the roads of Mesopotamia and Anatolia.\nAround 1900 BC, the kingdom of Kanesh and the city-state of Ashur, in modern-day Turkey and Iraq respectively, enjoyed a deep and special partnership against a backdrop of trade agreements and the circulation of goods and people.\nOut of sight, out of mind?\nOld Assyrian merchants, as we call them, exported textiles and tin to Anatolia to be exchanged for silver, gold and copper. This was one of the first long-distance trading enterprises. To facilitate this trade, it was common for merchants to move from Ashur to Kanesh. There they settled more or less permanently in the lower town, forming what we could recognise as an expat community.\nCuneiform writing takes its name from the wedge-shaped strokes impressed by the stylus on the soft clay, from Latin cuneus meaning \u2018wedge\u2019.\nTo sustain their long-distance activities, the merchants needed to communicate. 4,000 years ago, the most efficient and fastest information sharing devices were inscribed tablets. Shaped out of clay by hand, tablets were impressed with a stylus while the clay was still soft. Once dried out, they were wrapped in a sheet of clay bearing the names of the sender and the addressee \u2013 in other words, an envelope.\nA clay tablet inside its half-open envelope. Tablets were enclosed in a clay envelope to preserve the information they carried. Just like today, envelopes were usually discarded after being opened.\nArchaeologists have found 23,000 of these tablets, from a period of about 150 years. The many letters merchants sent and received offer us a glimpse of what life would have been like in those days. Having spent the last year studying these tablets, I have got to read some of their stories and it is always a thrill to sit down in the Museum\u2019s study room and to walk down memory lane, albeit further down than I usually would.\nFirst person accounts\nWhat I love most about Old Assyrian letters is their spontaneity. The introduction formula is kept to a minimum, \u2018from so-and-so to so-and-so say this\u2019, then comes the message in the first person. The message typically contains instructions from one merchant to his trading partner about the forthcoming shipment: the types and quantities of goods, their unit price and the applicable exchange rates, practical arrangements for the caravan and its staff in terms of accommodation and subsistence, even including the fodder for the donkeys.\nSometimes, the message has a more peculiar substance. While reading a letter of instructions sent by Buzazu to his trading partners, I discovered that he said:\nLet them [the transporters] bring the tin via the narrow track [smuggling route] if it is clear. If not, let them make small packets of my tin and introduce them gradually into Kanesh, concealed in their underwear.\nIn this letter Buzazu actually cancels the smuggling operation after the situation had changed and was no longer favourable. Yet we are left wondering about the hows and whys of trade and contraband, not to mention the practicalities of concealing ingots of metal in one\u2019s underwear.\nBuzazu cancels a smuggling operation, detailing how the goods would have been brought if the plan had happened.\nRule makers and rule breakers\nThe agreement struck between Kanesh and Ashur regulated the activities of the trade in terms of authorised or prohibited goods as well as in terms of taxes to be applied to transactions. For example, iron \u2013 a rare and expensive metal costing up to 7 times the price of gold \u2013 and the lapis lazuli extracted from distant Afghanistan were sold under state monopoly.\nMirroring these regulations, a system of contraband was set up, either to avoid paying the relevant taxes or in order to trade restricted products. Thanks to the letters they wrote, we know of some of the taxes Old Assyrian merchants were supposed to pay: transport and import taxes upon arrival in Kanesh, tolls and duties on goods and persons en route and an export tax upon departure from Ashur.\nWhere there is a will there is a way, and for smugglers this was the \u2018narrow track\u2019. Going through the mountainous paths of Anatolia, merchants got around some of the taxes by taking a detour away from authorised routes and checkpoints. Lacking the protection offered on official routes, the journey was more perilous, exposed to wild beasts, highway thieves and a harsh climate.\nSmuggling also meant fooling the customs system either by not declaring taxable goods or by making a partial declaration. Along with the underwear trick elaborated by Buzazu, the merchants\u2019 letters describe various ruses, whether that meant paying off the guards or hiring mules among the locals who would have known the place inside out.\nWriting to his partners Pushu-ken and Rabi-Ashur, the merchant Kunilum instructs them to wait for cleared goods to return from the customs office so that they can be mixed and shipped together with undeclared goods in order to arouse less suspicion.\nAs lucrative as it may have been, smuggling was still illegal and convicted smugglers would have faced sanctions ranging from cash penalties to house arrest and jail. We know of the case of the merchant Pushu-ken, whose house was raided and found with smuggled goods, leading to a jail sentence for contraband. Despite the risks, merchants remained keen to smuggle, as we can read in Ishtar-pilah\u2019s plea to Pushu-ken:\nYou are my colleague! Just as you send an order for your own goods to be smuggled, do also send one for my goods.\nA family affair\nFunnily enough, Pushu-ken happens to have been the father of Buzazu. Old Assyrian trade was a family business and we can still read the correspondence between Buzazu and his relatives: his mother Lamassi, his sister Ahaha, his brothers Sueyya, Ikun-pasha and Ashur-muttabbil.\nBuzazu\u2019s family tree, reconstructed from the letters he sent and received.\nSueyya, the eldest son, grew up and went to school in Ashur while Pushu-ken had already settled a thousand miles away in Kanesh to oversee the activities of the family firm. One of the most touching letters was written by the young Sueyya to his father, boasting about his learning of cuneiform and demonstrating it with neat and careful writing.\nA letter about school from the young Sueyya to his father Pushu-ken.\nThe tablets written by Old Assyrian merchants are their private papers, recounting in the first person what they did, what they wish they had done and what they shall do, in life and business alike. So whenever I am asked what I do for a living, I have to confess: I listen to people\u2019s accounts of their lives in their own words. I read the tablets they wrote 4,000 years ago, fascinated by the stories of the life they lived. And what a life they led!\nFind out more in this curator\u2019s corner video:"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/charmed-lives-in-greece/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Charmed lives in Greece", "author": "Evita Arapoglou, Ian Collins, Sir Michael Llewellyn-Smith, and Ioanna Moraiti, exhibition co-curators", "timestamp": "2018-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "The Museum\u2019s new exhibition in Room 5 brings together the lives and works of three artists \u2013\u00a0the painters Niko Ghika and John Craxton, and the writer Patrick (\u2018Paddy\u2019) Leigh Fermor.

He first took art lessons from Konstantinos Parthenis and in 1923 he left for Paris to study at the Acad\u00e9mie Ranson. At 21 he had his first solo exhibition in Paris where he remained until 1934. His friends there included Le Corbusier, George Seferis, and the art critics Christian Zervos and Stratis Eleftheriadis (T\u00e9riade).

A member of the Academy of Athens and an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Arts in London, Ghika held 46 one-man shows in Athens, Paris, London, New York and elsewhere.

He attended numerous schools briefly, and never secured a formal qualification in his life, not even in the art that obsessed him. A wartime friend of Lucian Freud and Graham Sutherland, he found youthful fame as a leading Neo-Romantic artist (though he always rejected the label) but felt trapped in England.\nJohn Craxton (1922\u20132009), Landscape with derelict windmill.

Benaki Museum \u2013 Photographic Archive, Athens. \u00a9 Benaki Museum 2018.\nPatrick Leigh Fermor (1915\u20132011) had a rather disturbed childhood, often separated from his parents. He attended King\u2019s School Canterbury from which he was expelled following an innocent friendship with the daughter of a local tradesman. In 1934 he set off in search of adventure on a long walk across Europe, from Rotterdam to Constantinople, described more than 30 years later in his masterpieces A Time of Gifts and Between the Woods and the Water.\nThe cover of Between the Woods and the Water on display in Room 5.\nHis war service was with the Special Operations Executive in Crete. After the war he worked for a short time in Athens at the British Institute, and travelled extensively in and outside Greece. In the 1960s he settled with his wife Joan near Kardamyli in the Mani (southern Peloponnese) in a house he designed himself. It became a haven for the Leigh Fermors and their many friends. He was knighted in 2004, and died in 2011 after what he called \u2018a life of great happiness\u2019.\nBringing them together\nNikos and Barbara Ghika, John Craxton, Patrick and Joan Leigh Fermor on the terrace of the Ghika house, Hydra 1958.

The ties that bind them are Greece, its landscapes, and its way of life \u2013 and how each was inspired by this, and their friendship. They met at the end of the Second World War and soon, and lastingly, became close friends. The exhibition is therefore an exercise in collective biography as in art history. Apart from the works of art and the evocative texts, the exhibition includes personal letters, photographs (particularly by Joan Leigh Fermor), exhibition catalogues, dedications, visitors\u2019 books, all reflecting the charm of their life in Greece.\nCharmed lives in Greece: Ghika, Craxton,\nLeigh Fermor in Room 5.\nThe exhibition follows their work in a chronological framework, divided into sections built around the place where they lived \u2013 Hydra, Kardamyli, Crete and Corfu. Leigh Fermor and Craxton spent time in Ghika\u2019s ancestral home on Hydra, Kardamyli was where the Leigh Fermors lived and the Ghikas and Craxton visited, Craxton\u2019s home with his studio overlooking the sea was in Crete, and the Ghikas moved to Corfu after their house on Hydra burnt down. Each section is illustrated by the artistic works of Ghika and Craxton. Leigh Fermor is represented largely through his writings, extracts of which are shown on wall panels.\nNikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghika (left to right):\nSelf-portrait. Oil on canvas, 1942.

For visitors who are already familiar with the protagonists, their artworks and their writings, the exhibition will reveal more elements of their personalities through photographs, letters and dedications, quite a few of them presented for the first time. However, we hope that the show will convey the magic of a whole era in Greece to everyone who visits \u2013 that it will describe the charm which filled the lives and inspired the work of these three men.\nYou can find out more about the trio in this video:\nCharmed lives in Greece: Ghika, Craxton, Leigh Fermor is on display in Room 5 until 15 July 2018.\nSupported by the A.

The inner quadrangle of the new Museum had been intended as a garden space for promenading but it was quickly evident that the area didn\u2019t get enough light and therefore nothing was ever going to grow there.\nThe inner courtyard of the Museum before the Round Reading Room was built.\nIt didn\u2019t help that, when the final wing of the Museum was built to complete the quadrangle (the South Front), there was no door to the inner space so access for the public was severely restricted. A plan soon emerged to put a new structure in the quadrangle instead, and a design for a new reading room began to develop.\nPlanning and construction\n1852 sketch by Antonio Panizzi showing a suggested design for the new proposed Reading Room.\nThe new space was earmarked for library material because the library collection had grown massively under the leadership of Antonio Panizzi (Keeper of the Department of Printed Books from 1838). In 1827, before Panizzi\u2019s arrival, the collection contained 150,000 books. By 1856, when he became Principal Librarian (equivalent to Director today), that number had swelled to 520,000 and all those books needed to housed somewhere.\nWith Panizzi\u2019s original idea for a new reading room, further refined by the architect Sydney Smirke, funding was sought, and eventually agreed, from the Treasury in 1854. Work began that same year and a photographer was commissioned to capture some of the building works. William Lake Price took photographs of the construction in 1855, including this one showing the building of the Reading Room\u2019s iconic dome.\nBuilding of the Reading Room, 1855. Photo by William Lake Price.\nThe Reading Room used cast iron, concrete, glass and the latest heating and ventilation systems, making it a masterpiece of mid-19th-century technology. It has a diameter of 140 feet (approximately 42.6 metres) and was inspired by the domed Pantheon in Rome. It is not technically a free-standing dome. It was constructed in segments on a cast iron framework. The ceiling is suspended on cast iron struts hanging down from the frame and is made out of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9.\nThis is a drawing of the design for a portion of the ground floor plan\u2026\nDesign\u00a0 for a portion of the ground floor plan of the Reading Room, 1850s.\n\u2026and this is a drawing of the design for the Reading Room\u2019s beautiful windows, including the colour scheme.\nSydney Smirke\u2019s drawing for the window design of the Reading Room, including the colour, 1856.\nThe building was finished by 1857 and the first readers were admitted. It officially opened on 2 May 1857, and between 8 and 16 May, it was opened up for a special one-off public viewing. Over 62,000 visitors came to marvel at the new building. Here is a ticket inviting people to come and view the British Museum\u2019s new Round Reading Room.\nTicket to view the new Reading Room on 5 May 1857, with a plan of the new library (including iron bookstacks) on the back.\nOn the back of the ticket was a plan showing the layout of the new room, including the iron bookstacks which surrounded it.\nThe \u2018Iron Library\u2019 (the bookstacks surrounding the Reading Room) in the 1950s.\nThe \u2018Iron Library\u2019 \u2013\u00a0the bookstacks which surrounded the Reading Room \u2013\u00a0was built using perforated iron in an attempt to improve light levels (in an age before electric lighting). It was made up of three linear miles (4.8km) of bookcases, containing around 25 miles (40km) of shelving.\nThe Reading Room in around 1924. Photo: Donald Macbeth.\nThe Reading Room could accommodate 302 readers at 38 tables, all radiating out from the keyhole-shaped catalogue desk. The tables were padded and covered in black leather and the floor was covered in a special material that was designed to reduce noise. Access to the main door of the Reading Room was through the Front Hall and into a walkway leading to the entrance. The walkway on both the north and south sides was removed to make way for the Great Court building in the 1990s.\nThe Reading Room entrance doors and walkway.\nAround the oblong structure which housed the Iron Library was an \u2018inner road\u2019 which was open to the elements. Some of the iron work was badly damaged during an air strike in the Second World War, and the quadrants of the Iron Library have now all been demolished. Various structures were put into this space over the years, but all were removed, along with remaining the bookstacks themselves, when the Great Court was built in the late 1990s.\nHere\u2019s a video of what the Reading Room looked like in 1947:\nNotable readers\nThe new Reading Room was a great success and became an iconic venue in its own right. Notable readers included Karl Marx, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Oscar Wilde, Sylvia Pankhurst, Bram Stoker, Joseph Conrad, Lenin and George Orwell.\nOscar Wilde\u2019s signature from 1879.\nThe Central Archive holds many of their applications for readers\u2019 tickets and signatures when they used the library.\nReader applications from Sylvia Pankhurst (1908), Joseph Conrad (1920) and George Orwell (1937, under his real name Eric Blair).\nThe British Library, the Great Court and exhibitions\nIn 1973, the British Library officially separated from the British Museum. The library continued to be housed in the Reading Room until 1997, when the new British Library building opened in St Pancras. With this relocation, there was an opportunity to reimagine the Round Reading Room and the courtyard in which it sat.\nPreparation works for the building of the Great Court in the late 1990s.\nThe Great Court scheme was designed by Sir Norman Foster and one of the design briefs was to reveal hidden spaces within the Museum. Lord Foster\u2019s vision meant that the original inner courtyard could be seen again, for the first time since 1857 when the Round Reading Room was completed. The Great Court was opened in December 2000 by HM The Queen, the largest public covered square in Europe. The Reading Room remained a library and resource centre, with books focused on the Museum\u2019s collection and history.\nThe Great Court, opened in 2000, saw the Reading Room incorporated into the new design.\nIn 2007 the use of the Reading Room was again reimagined when it began to stage the Museum\u2019s important exhibitions. The exhibition The\u00a0First Emperor: China\u2019s Terracotta Army\u00a0was the perfect beginning for this period in the Reading Room\u2019s history, with the display of a selection of some of the iconic terracotta warriors\u00a0\u2013 the most ever exhibited outside of China.\nInside the exhibition The First Emperor: China\u2019s Terracotta Army.\nUsing the space for exhibitions meant that the Grade 1 listed interior needed to be protected. The desks and shelving were covered up and a stage built over them at the level of the lower balcony. Exhibitions would be arranged on the stage area, with the dome of the Reading Room still visible to anyone looking upwards.\nProtecting the Grade I listed building and desks during special exhibitions.\nAfter further exhibitions on the Roman emperor Hadrian, the Iranian ruler Shah \u02bfAbbas, the Aztec ruler Moctezuma, Italian Renaissance drawings, the ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead, saints and relics in medieval Europe, the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, and Shakespeare\u2019s world, the final special exhibition in the space was Life and death in Pompeii and Herculaneum, which ended in September 2013.\nView of the Museum during construction of the\u00a0World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre (bottom right). You can see the Great Court and Reading Room roof in the centre. Taken from the top of Senate House, May 2014.\nDuring this time, the Museum had been building the World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre, with a new purpose-built exhibitions space, meaning that the Reading Room was no longer needed for exhibitions. Since 2013, the Reading Room has been closed to the public, and the Museum has been consulting widely on what to do with the space.\nLooking to the future\nIn March 2018, it was announced that the Museum would temporarily open the Reading Room as part of the music festival Europe and the world: a symphony of cultures. In the words of the Museum\u2019s Director Hartwig Fischer, its use for performances will allow visitors \u2018to experience this atmospheric space in a new way.\u2019\nAs the iconic Reading Room looks back on over 160 years of history, it\u2019s also looking to the future\u2026"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-british-museum-membercast-cracking-the-egyptian-code/", "category": "Podcasts", "title": "The British Museum Membercast: Cracking the Egyptian code", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "The British Museum Membercast is a monthly podcast made available to \u2018all studious and curious persons\u2019.

The couple wanted to find out the inscription on a ring in the gallery which they wanted replicated on their wedding bands because the text they\u2019d read meant a lot to them. Medieval people were no different in their personal approaches to jewellery, and many different phrases and gems are to be found on existing pieces. But these weren\u2019t purely for reasons of romance or fashion and the choice of stone was of great importance to the medieval owner. In this blog, I\u2019ll be telling you about some of the pieces of medieval jewellery I care for in my job as curator.\nThe symbolic properties of gemstones in the Middle Ages lay in the biblical description of the heavenly city of Jerusalem, as described in the Book of Revelation. The city was described as made \u2018of pure gold\u2019, with each foundation of the walls embellished with a gemstone, such as ruby and amethyst, and each of the twelve gates being made of a pearl. The properties of these gems, and others, were recorded in tracts on stones known as \u2018lapidaries\u2019. These treatises are connected with bestiaries, books which provided detailed accounts of different beasts, tied to a Christian, allegorical story.\nFolio 96r of the Aberdeen Bestiary. England, c. 1200. \u00a9 University of Aberdeen.\nAs a stone which originated from a \u2018beast\u2019 the pearl is recorded in both bestiary and lapidary.\u00a0The Aberdeen Bestiary, written in 1300 described the oyster as a \u2018stone\u2019 within which the pearl was formed:\nWhen it [the oyster] rises from its resting-place to the surface of the sea, it opens its mouth and takes in some heavenly dew, and the rays of the sun shine around it; thus there grows within the stone a most precious, shining pearl indeed, conceived from the heavenly dew and given lustre by the rays of the sun. The stone, therefore\u2026 symbolises Saint Mary.\nBoth freshwater and seawater pearls were used in the period \u2013\u00a0the freshwater variety could be found in rivers in Britain, Ireland and France, and seawater pearls were from the Mediterranean and further afield. Few medieval pearls have survived on objects in the Museum\u2019s collection and this earring shows us why.\nGold earring with crystal, pearls and emerald. Halkida, Greece.\nThe gold earring is set with a clear crystal and an emerald. Below these are suspended two gold trumpets, each with a pearl at its end. When we look closer we find that the pearls have been drilled and are held in place by a thin gold wire forming a delicate pin.\u00a0 Originally, it would have had three of these projections. For archaeological jewellery, such as this earring (which was from a hoard of merchant\u2019s goods found in Halkida, Greece), the pin and pearl could easily become lost or damaged.\nFinger ring set with a cabochon sapphire. England, 13th century.\nOne stone which has been discovered in medieval tombs is the sapphire. Particularly popular for bishops\u2019 rings, sapphire set rings have been found in the grave of Walter Gray, Archbishop of York (d. 1255), and said to have been found in the grave of William Wytlesey, Archbishop of Canterbury (d. 1374). You can see the incredible detail on this example which was found in the Somerset village of Cannington. The sapphire is very large and it is set in its uncut, highly polished form.\nDetail showing the sides of the finger ring, decorating in openwork with engraved birds. England, 13th century.\nBelow the stone, the decoration is openwork, with birds with spread wings and turned heads. Under this, two open-mouthed beasts bite the base of the birds connecting to the hoop. The animals have round, bear-like, ears and tiny dots representing the mane or fur. Along the hoop is engraved Latin text, \u2018Ave Maria Gratia Plena DMI\u2019 or \u2018Hail Mary Full of the Grace of the Lord\u2019. Bishops were given a ring for their investiture ceremony, which symbolised their vow to serve the church faithfully. The sapphire, then, was a logical choice, as it represented chastity in marriage, as the churchman was married to God.\nUnlike the uncut polished stone in the sapphire ring, this next ring is set with a diamond, cut to form a pyramidal shape projecting from the bezel. In the 1400s the use of the cutting wheel meant that diamonds could have different outlines and facets could be cut into diamonds more easily. The stone was associated with purity and was popular with royalty.\nGold finger ring with a diamond and engravings.

The illustration shows the diamond setting on the right. England, 15th century.\nIt is said that in the 15th\u00a0century the tradition of an engagement ring set with a diamond came into practice, although the exact date is not known. In 1477 the Archduke Maximillian of Austria married Mary of Burgundy and her betrothal ring was set with a diamond.\nGold amulet ring, 16th century.\nOne of the oddest medieval stones is the \u2018toadstone\u2019. You can see it on this 16th-century ring. It is a smooth, shiny dome which is a mottled brown colour. O M Dalton, in his 1912 catalogue of the Museum\u2019s ring collection, tells us that \u2018the toadstone was supposed to be carried by the toad in his head, whence it might be cut out, or to be thrown out of the mouth if the creature was placed upon a piece of red cloth\u2019. This stone was worn to protect the owner from kidney stones, to protect newborns and to identify poison. However, the stone had no connection to a toad whatsoever, but instead is the fossilised tooth of a fish, Lepidotus maximus.\nYou can see Naomi discussing these beautiful pieces of jewellery in this video:"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/illustrating-poetry-on-a-12th-century-chinese-handscroll/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "Illustrating poetry on a 12th-century Chinese handscroll", "author": "Yu-ping Luk, Basil Gray Curator: Chinese Paintings, Prints and Central Asian Collection and Andrew Shore", "timestamp": "2018-03-21 00:00:00", "text": "One of the exciting changes to the newly refurbished Sir Joseph Hotung Gallery of China and South Asia\u00a0(Room 33) is the creation of a space designated for Chinese paintings, calligraphy and prints. Before the refurbishment, the light levels and a lack of bespoke cases for scrolls meant we couldn\u2019t regularly display scrolls. Six scroll paintings are now on display \u2013 highlights selected to showcase a range of styles and subject matter. In this post, I will introduce one of these \u2013 Illustrations to the Odes of Chen, a handscroll painted by Ma Hezhi (fl. c. 1131\u20131162) of the Southern Song dynasty (1127\u20131279).\nThe Southern Song emperor Gaozong (r. 1127\u20131162) commissioned the Illustrations to the Odes of Chen as part of an ambitious artistic project to illustrate all 305 poems compiled in China\u2019s oldest poetry anthology, the Book of Odes (Shijing) (c. 1000\u2013600 BC). It was intended to enhance the emperor\u2019s legitimacy and to help revive the authority of the Song ruling household following the catastrophic loss of the capital and the northern part of China to the Jurchens, a semi-nomadic people from northeast Asia. Today 20 scrolls survive, but many are later copies. The art historian Julia Murray thinks that the British Museum\u2019s version is likely to date to the Southern Song dynasty.\nThe scroll consists of ten scenes that illustrate odes (or short folksongs and ballads) about the ancient State of Chen, which existed in the plains of what is now Henan province. The scroll follows the \u2018Mao edition\u2019 of the poems, compiled in the Han dynasty (206 BC\u2013AD 220) by scholars with the family name Mao. This edition gives a short moral commentary on each of the poems. These are written on the handscroll as a preface to each of the ten poems. The writing is in the style of Gaozong\u2019s calligraphy.\nThe first two scenes of the scroll are now on display in Room 33. The first is titled \u2018Wanqiu\u2019, a place in the State of Chen.\nThe calligraphic text for the first ode \u2018Wanqiu\u2019, in Ma Hezhi (fl. c. 1131\u20131162), Illustrations to the Odes of Chen. Handscroll, ink and colour on silk.\nThe poem has been translated by James Legge:\nHow gay and dissipated you are,\nThere on the top of Wanqiu!\nYou are full of kindly affection indeed,\nBut you have nothing to make you looked up to!\nHow your blows on the drum resound,\nAt the foot of Wanqiu!\nBe it winter, be it summer,\nYou are holding your egret\u2019s feather!\nHow you beat your earthen vessel,\nOn the way to Wanqiu!\nBe it winter, be it summer,\nYou are holding your egret-fan!\nAccording to the commentary from the Mao edition, this poem criticises the ruler of the State of Chen for his lascivious and excessive ways. More recent interpretations take a different view and suggest that the poem expresses longing towards a dancing female shaman. The painter of the scroll has followed the Mao edition by depicting only men performing ritual music and dance in the scene.\nPainting illustrating the ode \u2018Wanqiu\u2019.\nThe figure facing the front and holding a feathered banner or whisk is most likely the ruler of the Chen State. At first the moral judgement expressed in the Mao edition does not seem obvious in the painting, but details suggest otherwise. For instance, the two musicians seated at the front have uncertain expressions on their faces, while the loosely painted wavy lines of the landscape create a sense of instability that echoes the unrestrained actions of the ruler.\nThe second scene in the scroll is titled \u2018White Elms at the East Gate\u2019.\nThe calligraphic text for the second ode \u2018White Elms at the East Gate\u2019.\nHere is a translation by James Legge:\n[There are] the white elms at the east gate.\nAnd the oaks on Wanqiu;\nThe daughter of Zizhong,\nDances about under them\nA good morning having been chosen,\nFor the plain in the South,\nShe leaves twisting her hemp,\nAnd dances to it through the market-place.\nThe morning being good for excursion,\nThey all proceed together.\nI look on you as the flower of the thorny mallows;\nYou give me a stalk of the pepper plant.\nThe subject of this poem is romance: women dance in the streets and couples go on excursions together. But the Mao edition condemns this behaviour as symptomatic of social disorder. It argues that as a result of the bad example set by the ruler of Chen, lax moral behaviour has spread among ordinary people who neglect their work and instead sing, dance and court each other in the marketplace. This second scene shows the wider social consequences of the first scene.\nPainting illustrating the ode \u2018White Elms at the East Gate\u2019.\nIn the painting, a young woman below a tall elm tree gestures towards a young man on the other side of the tree. She is probably holding a small stalk of the pepper plant mentioned in the poem. Clearly, she is interested in the young man. The response of the young man, however, is more ambiguous. Is he turning towards her or away from her?\nDetail from the painting illustrating the ode \u2018White Elms at the East Gate\u2019.\nThis interaction reminds me of a famous scene in the Admonitions Scroll, which is also about proper interactions between men and women, and likewise open to different readings.\nThe Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies\u00a0(detail) attributed to Gu Kaizhi (c. 344\u2013c. 406). Panel mounted handscroll, ink and colours on silk, c. 5th\u20136th century AD.\nIn addition, the flowing lines, the fluttering ribbons and dress of the figures painted by Ma Hezhi are reminiscent of the Admonitions Scroll. This suggests the legacy of Gu Kaizhi\u2019s style of figure painting in the Song dynasty.\nThe painter in the Illustrations to the Odes of Chen has followed the poem closely by setting the scene in a marketplace. There is a shop selling grains in the background. Men and women in the street, including the shopkeeper, look on with surprise and disapproval at the young couple and their actions. This scroll promotes a strict sense of morality and proper behaviour, in which the emperor Gaozong as calligrapher-patron is presented as the arbiter.\nAfter the ten scenes, there is a colophon by the important late Ming painter Dong Qichang (1555\u20131636) and an inscription by the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736\u20131795). Seal marks indicate that this painting was once in the Qing imperial collections. At the end of the scroll is a seal that refers to the major connoisseur and collector of Chinese paintings C C Wang (1907\u20132003). The British Museum purchased this scroll in 1964 from Denise Ellenburger-Loo.\nDue to the size of the case, only two scenes can be shown at a time, so different sections from the scroll will be displayed in future rotations. The gallery\u2019s refurbishment marks a new era for displaying Chinese paintings in the Museum.\nYou can see this handscroll on display in the Sir Joseph Hotung Gallery of China and South Asia."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/international-women-collectors/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "International women collectors", "author": "Sushma Jansari, Curator of Asian Ethnographic and South Asia Collections", "timestamp": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "Between the 19th century and the present day, many women collected objects during their travels around the world and either donated or sold this material to the British Museum.

Such influence is most marked in the realm of the arts, i.e. music, painting, literature, dancing, dress and lifestyle. The music, which consists of drumming, singing, and dancing, indeed a central pillar of the ritual setting, is essential for the success of a ceremony. Vodou encompasses many rites, or styles of worship, but it is usually subsumed under two major rites \u2013\u00a0the Rada, which is considered cool, and the Kongo-Petwo, seen as hot.\nVodou boula drum. Haiti, early 20th century.\nTo appreciate the role of the beautiful drum\u00a0on display in Room 3, we should focus on the drumming in the Rada rite to which it belongs.\nThe Rada rite uses a battery of three conic drums which play in constant dialogue with each other, known respectively, according their size and function within the musical ensemble, as oun (the largest), ounto\u00a0(the middle), and ountoki (the smallest). This smallest drum is also known as boula, and this is the type of drum on display in Room 3. Two other instruments complete the ensemble: the ogan (bell) and the ason \u2013 the sacred rattle played by the oungan or manbo, the officiating priest or priestess and/or chorus leader.\nThe boula plays with two small sticks a continuous and regular pattern and produces a high pitch. The middle drum uses a straight stick and a curved one like a half moon, and produces a tenor tone. The largest plays with a bare hand and hammer-shaped stick producing a grave sound that punctuates and supports the singing of the chorus of ounsi (participants), and choreographs the dancing faithful in the peristyle (Vodou temple).\nDrumming is the heartbeat of the lakou (Vodou community), and indeed according to its practitioners, it is the voice of the ancestors, for it leads to transcendence and propels the people to a level that connects to their roots in Africa.\nKate Ramsey explains how the US Occupation of Haiti between 1915 and 1934 created the circumstances that led to the drum\u2019s unlikely journey to the British Museum.\nIn 1930, John Stavers, a Lieutenant-Colonel in the British Army, donated a drum to the British Museum. The entry recording that gift is spare, identifying it as a \u2018Voodoo drum taken in a police raid at Aux Cayes\u2019, on the southern coast of Haiti.\n1930 British Museum donations book entry recording the arrival of the Vodou drum.\nMore precisely, as Gerd\u00e8s has mentioned above, this was a boula drum, played for Rada spirits in ceremonies of the Haitian Vodou religion. Whose drum had this been? Why was it taken away? How did it come into Stavers\u2019 hands? The brief log entry seems to raise more questions than it answers. Yet this drum has stories to tell about the interlinked histories of Vodou, US imperialism and museum collecting during this era.\nJohn Stavers in 1918. \u00a9 IWM (HU 126889)\nWe know through the research of British Museum Curator Kate Jarvis that Stavers had travelled by steamship to Jamaica in 1927 and thus likely acquired the drum during this trip. When he disembarked in Kingston, Haiti had been under US marine occupation since 1915, and would remain so until 1934. US expansionism in the Caribbean was in high gear during the first decades of the 20th century, as Washington sought to turn a region long colonised by western European powers into an \u2018American sea\u2019. Officials justified taking over Haiti, the second oldest independent nation in the hemisphere, by attributing a \u2018disorder\u2019 that they pledged to \u2018clean up\u2019. Disbanding the Haitian army, marines trained and officered a newly formed civil-military gendarmerie \u2013 the \u2018police\u2019 cited in the entry recording Stavers\u2019 donation.\nMembers of the Haitian Gendarmerie after winning an Olympic bronze medal in the men\u2019s team free rifle event in 1924. They are joined by a supervising officer of the US Marine Corps. Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, LC-B2- 6236-9.\nFor decades before this, writers hostile to Haiti\u2019s existence had constructed lurid fantasies of \u2018vaudoux\u2019 or \u2018voodoo\u2019 to argue that \u2018civilisation\u2019 went into decline there after former slaves and free people of colour overthrew French colonial rule in 1804. At times drawing upon such images to defend US military presence and policy in Haiti, marines also targeted Vodou as a locus of anti-occupation insurgency. In so doing, they enforced statutes that Haitian authorities had rarely applied, raiding ceremonies, arresting practitioners, and confiscating drums and other sacred instruments and objects. According to the letter of the law, such items were then supposed to be destroyed. However, the boula that Stavers brought back to London is evidence that, in fact, marines frequently kept the drums they took in raids as prized trophies, or passed them on.\nWhile it is possible that Stavers came into possession of the boula in Jamaica, the specificity of his donation entry suggests that he may have visited Les Cayes at some point himself, especially given the active steamer route between this southern Haitian port and Kingston at the time. Either way, the boula\u2019s transatlantic passage points to how confiscated drums circulated far beyond Haiti during and after the 19-year occupation. Mirroring Stavers\u2019 bequest, many marines upon returning home donated or sold drums and other sacred objects seized in raids to anthropology, natural history and military museums. Often these were among the first, if not the earliest, Haitian acquisitions of such institutions. They arrived as icons of a religion that US officials never recognised as such, and that had become the subject of widespread international fascination and fantasy, intensified by years of occupation.\nThe Asahi Shimbun Display\u00a0A revolutionary legacy:\u00a0Haiti and Toussaint Louverture,\u00a0supported by The Asahi Shimbun, is in Room 3\u00a0until 22 April 2018.\nDr Kate Ramsey is Associate Professor of History at the University of Miami and author of The Spirits and the Law: Vodou and Power in Haiti.\nDr Gerd\u00e8s Fleurant is Professor Emeritus at Wellesley College and author of Dancing Spirits: Rhythms and Rituals of Haitian Vodun, the Rada Rite."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/haiti-and-toussaint-louverture-the-response-must-be-a-remix/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Haiti and Toussaint Louverture: the response must be a remix", "author": "Gina Athena Ulysse, artist and Professor of Anthropology, Wesleyan University and Andrew Shore", "timestamp": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "I cannot recall when exactly I learned the revolutionary leader Toussaint Br\u00e9da had added Louverture to his name, declaring himself the opening.

In the 21st century, Black humanity is still in question. Black lives are still of less value and continue to be under siege everywhere. Haiti\u2019s plight, and the exploitation of Haitians, is part of the current news cycle in the UK at the time of writing this. Moreover, the legacies of slavery often sanitised to the past outside of academic circles, continue to unfold in our daily lives.\nFor some years now, I have been working on how to express, give voice to, and textually represent, Black struggle, rage and liberation, informed by the late Haitian anthropologist Michel-Rolph Trouillot. In his book Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History, he asserted that, \u2018none of us starts with a clean slate. But the historicity of the human condition also requires that practices of power and domination be renewed.\u2019 According to Trouillot, we are, \u2018caught in legacies of past horrors that are made possible only by their renewal.\u2019\nHow does one react, create and meditate on subjugation, defiance, triumphs and re-subjugation when the past is now, when the past has become our present? Can such a creative performance be an intervention, an opening?\nOnly a remix will do, for performing this revolution will be live. After total immersion in my research process with the usual scholarly suspects, I have to admit that I have been actively excavating ghosts. Inspired by reawakened Ancestors. As feminist scholar M Jacqui Alexander has so eloquently noted in her book, Pedagogies of Crossing, \u2018the dead do not like to be forgotten.\u2019\nThe question that looms largest and grounds my work is a simple one: a revolution against what? Haiti is symbolic of Blackness globally. Colonial tactics in the Caribbean region were put into practice elsewhere. My task is to put interconnected histories of colonialism, slavery and rebellion in concert with more contemporary musings on freedom, from Suzanne C\u00e9saire and Frantz Fanon, to James Baldwin, Billie Holiday and Nina Simone, among others. I want to viscerally contemplate the unfinished business of a Black Revolution, which achieved what none of the preceding European revolutions, with their investment in enslavement, could: universal freedom for all races.

Every corner of the Museum was arresting in its own way. A living, breathing monument that has too many stories to tell. The Enlightenment Gallery (Room 1) with Sir Hans Sloane\u2019s natural and artificial rarities made me curiouser and curiouser. The great Reading Room, where Karl Marx worked on Das Kapital, reminded me that the Communist Manifesto was recently translated into Krey\u00f2l. The Money Gallery (Room 68) was a potent reminder that during the US Occupation of Haiti (1915\u20131934), Haiti\u2019s gold reserves were confiscated by the Marines and brought to the vaults of the National City Bank of New York. Curiouser and curiouser. William Wordsworth\u2019s sonnet\u00a0To Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture (1802) and John Agard\u2019s response are also raw material for me.\nVodou boula drum of the Rada battery, seized during the US occupation of Haiti.

Sugar, coffee, cotton and indigo produced by the enslaved population made a significant contribution to the wealth of France. Although resistance to slavery \u2013 through poisoning, infanticide and everyday acts of disruption \u2013 had long been widespread, challenges to the plantation system were violently repressed.\nThe French Revolution provided the context, however, for more systematic and sustained emancipation struggle. Led initially by the free people of colour of Saint-Domingue, whose aim was equality with the colony\u2019s white inhabitants, this spread from August 1791 to a wider revolt among the enslaved black population.\nA key figure in the events that would become the Haitian Revolution was Toussaint Louverture, a formerly enslaved man who would rise to the rank of Governor-General of the colony. Louverture led his armies against the British, French and Spanish, and eventually sided with France to abolish slavery \u2013 including in the neighbouring Spanish colony of Santo Domingo (now the Dominican Republic), which he occupied to unite the island of Hispaniola.\nJohn Kay (1742\u20131826), Toussaint Louverture in A Complete Collection of the Portraits and caricatures Drawn and Engraved by John Kay Edinburgh From the year 1784 to 1813.

Meanwhile, Louverture\u2019s general Jean-Jacques Dessalines reignited the revolutionary struggle, defeated the French at the Battle of Verti\u00e8res in November 1803, and declared Haitian independence on 1 January 1804.\nHaiti became the first independent black republic in the world, and the second nation in the western hemisphere (following the USA) to gain its independence in an anti-colonial war. Unlike the American and French Revolutions, however, the struggle in Haiti was motivated by a quest for universal as opposed to selective emancipation. This aim was rooted in an inclusive understanding of human rights that extended to all, and depended on the ending of both colonial rule and enslavement.\nKnown in Haiti as the \u2018Precursor\u2019, Toussaint Louverture is celebrated widely as the military genius, political strategist and diplomatic tactician who transformed a revolt into a revolution, and laid the foundation for Haitian independence. His achievement served as an inspiration and warning across the Americas, and continues to motivate radical and anti-racist movements throughout the world. He has been widely represented since his death in literature, historiography and the visual arts.\nLubaina Himid\u2019s mixed-media Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture (1987) uses a collage of words from contemporary newspaper headlines \u2013 \u2018RACIST\u2019, \u2018TORTURE\u2019, \u2018ABUSE\u2019 \u2013 to underline the contrast between the promise of universal emancipation won by the Haitian Revolution and the persistence of racial inequalities in the modern world. \u2018The news wouldn\u2019t be news,\u2019 the piece declares, \u2018if you had heard of Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture.\u2019 Inspired by her reading of C L R James\u2019s Black Jacobins, Himid also produced a series of watercolours on the Haitian revolutionary leader. Playfully domesticating her subject\u2019s life by bringing Louverture\u2019s wife into the frame, Himid asks: \u2018but who does the laundry?\u2019 In another piece, Himid subverts conventional city guidebooks by raising a statue of Louverture in Trafalgar Square, using his imagined presence to foreground alternative Black histories of European capitals. Himid\u2019s work challenges the silencing of Haiti in British historiography (an amnesia all the more surprising given the key role played by British troops in the struggle against Louverture between 1793 and 1798 in revolutionary Saint-Domingue). It also stresses the continued relevance, for parallel struggles today, of the historic Haitian fight against slavery and colonialism.\nNicolas Maurin (1799\u20131850), Toussaint Louverture published by F S Delpech in Iconographie des contemporains depuis 1789 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 1829. Lithograph, 1833.\nThe award of the 2017 Turner Prize to Himid has brought her work to a wider audience, and has increased general awareness of the stories of the Haitian Revolution. In fact, Himid\u2019s representations of Louverture are part of a wider catalogue of visualisations that began during his lifetime, and then proliferated after 1803 as his reputation continued to grow. There are no surviving formal portraits of Louverture, so therefore much of the commentary on these images focuses on questions of the true likeness of their subject. For instance, illustrations in an account of the Revolution by a British army officer present at the time, are often thought to have been drawn from life, but it is the distinctive profile of a lithograph by Nicolas Maurin (above), produced 30 years after Louverture\u2019s death and rejected as a likeness by its subject\u2019s surviving son Isaac, that has achieved iconic status. Stories of newly discovered contemporary portraits are not uncommon, but equally important for understanding Louverture\u2019s afterlives are the many subsequent visual representations. These range from Cham\u2019s caricatures in Le Punch \u00e0 Paris in 1850 to much more recent works by Kimathi Donkor, Edouard Duval-Carri\u00e9 and Ulrick Jean-Pierre.\nJacob Lawrence with pictures from The Life of Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture, teaching a group of children at Lincoln School, New Rochelle, USA, 1941.

The series of 41 images illustrates the continued transnational impact of Haiti in debates about African-American identity. Lawrence\u2019s series is in dialogue with earlier representations of the Haitian Revolutionary leader, a number of which the artist consulted in the 135th Street branch of the New York Public Library (now the Schomberg Center).\nJacob Lawrence (1917\u20132000), General Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture from the series The Life of Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture.

Lawrence\u2019s use of a comic-book aesthetic anticipates subsequent accounts of the Haitian Revolution and the lives of its leaders in comics like Corpse Talk\u00a0by Adam Murphy, Drums of Freedom by the Guyanese creator Barrington Braithwaite, or the new graphic history\u00a0by Rocky Cotard and Laurent Dubois.\nLouverture\u2019s increasing visibility as global revolutionary figure suggests that he is achieving a transcultural iconic status rivalled only by Che Guevara. Yet this presents clear challenges: does it imply the final stage in what some see as Louverture\u2019s conscription to forms of neo-colonial modernity; or does it contain the residual potential for reignition, in the present, of the Haitian revolutionary\u2019s struggle for universal emancipation, not least in Haiti itself?\nThe Asahi Shimbun Display\u00a0A revolutionary legacy: Haiti and Toussaint Louverture, supported by The Asahi Shimbun, is in Room 3 until 22 April 2018.\nCharles Forsdick is co-author, with Christian Hogsbjerg, of Toussaint Louverture: A Black Jacobin in an Age of Revolution (Pluto, 2017).

While contemporary artists idealised the world around them in their art, Rembrandt\u2019s prints and drawings reveal a fascination with depicting unmediated reality. Rembrandt\u2019s representation of women in particular demonstrates how he rejected the artistic conventions of the day.\nLeft: Rembrandt, Diana at the bath (print study). Drawing, black chalk with some light brown wash, c. 1630\u20131631. Right: Rembrandt, Diana at the bath. Etching, c. 1631.\nThis black chalk drawing of Diana is the artist\u2019s earliest known study of a female nude (c. 1630\u20131631). Traditionally Diana, the chaste mythological goddess of the hunt, was portrayed in art as an epitome of female beauty. Drawing from a live model, Rembrandt depicts Diana caught in a private moment, her sagging, wrinkled skin on view. In the etching made after the drawing, Rembrandt details the surface texture of Diana\u2019s dimpled thighs. Rembrandt removes Diana from the mythological narrative, and depicts the earthy flesh of the model before him. Rembrandt thus blurs the boundaries between myth and reality \u2013 in the drawing, only the roughly sketched quiver of arrows hanging behind the figure identifies her as the goddess Diana.\nLeft: Rembrandt, Woman lying awake in bed. Drawing, pen and brown ink, c. 1635\u20131640. Right: Rembrandt, Young woman sleeping. Drawing, brush and brown wash, c. 1654.\nRembrandt\u2019s drawings of the domestic realm offer an intimate look at the women in his life. The pen-and-ink drawing, Woman lying awake (c. 1635\u20131640), is thought to represent his wife Saskia van Uylenburgh. She may have been confined to bed during child birth, or because of ill-health \u2013\u00a0she died in 1642, eight years after their marriage in 1634. In the drawing, Rembrandt concentrates on the drapery folds, turning a private moment into a careful examination of line. Rembrandt often used his wife as model for his historical and mythological paintings.\nAlmost 20 years later, Rembrandt depicts a young woman sleeping, almost certainly Hendrickje Stoffels, his common-law wife from his late years. The graceful brush-and-wash drawing evokes intimacy with minimal details \u2013\u00a0his loose brushstrokes, characteristic of his late style, frame the composition. The three drawings of women by Rembrandt span early, middle and late periods in the artist\u2019s life \u2013\u00a0they have distinct functions, styles, and media. From a detailed representation of Diana\u2019s flesh, through the careful study of drapery in Saskia\u2019s bed, to a tender portrayal of the sleeping Hendrickje, they all exhibit an intimacy and directness that is characteristic of the artist.\nLeft: Rembrandt, Adam and Eve (state II). Etching, 1638. Right: Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Adam and Eve. Engraving, 1504.\nIn representations of the Fall of Man throughout western art, style takes on both theological significance and erotic charge. Traditionally, the first couple was depicted as an embodiment of ideal proportions and beauty \u2013 Albrecht D\u00fcrer, for example, modelled his figures on Greek statues to emphasise that humans were made in God\u2019s image. Rembrandt was an avid art collector, and owned a portfolio of prints by D\u00fcrer. He took inspiration from the German artist\u2019s composition, but rendered his figures in a characteristically unidealised way, adding a layer of psychological depth to the narrative. Rembrandt\u2019s Adam and Eve lack the grace and beauty of D\u00fcrer\u2019s figures \u2013 their hunched posture and contorted faces suggests the pair is shown at a critical moment of decision. Rembrandt emphasised the human element in his religious scenes \u2013\u00a0lifelike details provide fresh insight into well-known narratives. By including details observed from life (from live models and domestic moments, to exotic animals that passed through Amsterdam) Rembrandt\u2019s careful study and unflinching representation of the natural world makes his work accessible and intriguing to the modern viewer.\nRembrandt\u2019s depictions of women elicited harsh criticism in his lifetime and in the subsequent centuries. Shortly after his death, Dutch poet Andries Pels (1631\u20131681) complained that Rembrandt deliberately chose to represent \u2018vulgar peasant women\u2019 in place of a \u2018Greek Venus.\u2019 British author Benjamin Robert Haydon (1786\u20131846) wrote in the 18th century that Rembrandt\u2019s \u2018notions of the delicate forms of women would have frightened an arctic bear.\u2019 The reception of Rembrandt\u2019s women says more about the tastes and conventions of the day. In 19th-century France, for example, artists and printmakers were drawn to Rembrandt\u2019s unmediated representations and innovative techniques. Rembrandt\u2019s women have always been a source of fascination, and his stark and intimate portrayals of women make them captivating to modern audiences.\nThe British Museum holds one the most comprehensive collections of Rembrandt\u2019s prints and drawings.

It is celebrated across India and Nepal, and among the Hindu diaspora around the world.\nKrishna squirting coloured water at Radha. Painting, Pahari School, early 19th century.\nThe three main myths associated with Holi involve the Hindu gods Vishnu, Krishna or Shiva. People in various parts of India focus on different forms of each of these myths. One of the most popular stories concerns Vishnu and his devotee, Prahlada. According to one version of this story, Prahlada was the son of an evil king named Hiranyakashipu who demanded that everyone should worship only him. Prahlada refused to worship his father and instead continued to pray to the god Vishnu. Holika, King Hiranyakashipu\u2019s sister, grew angry at Prahlada because of his devotion to Vishnu and decided to kill him. She had been previously blessed by the gods so that she would not be harmed by fire, so she tricked Prahlada into sitting on her lap while she sat in a fire. Prahlada survived this ordeal because he prayed to Vishnu, while Holika perished. \u2018Holi\u2019, the name of the festival, is derived from the name \u2018Holika\u2019.\nKrishna and Radha surrounded by women who are playing musical instruments and throwing coloured powder at them. Painting, Rajasthan School, early 19th century.\nAnother story linked with Holi is about Krishna\u2019s love for Radha. Krishna\u2019s skin was dark blue because a demoness had tried to poison him when he was a baby, and Krishna was worried that Radha wouldn\u2019t like him because of his appearance. His mother, Yashoda, playfully suggested that he smear some brightly coloured powder on Radha\u2019s face. After Krishna did this, Radha fell in love with him and they were later married.\nA king with his favourite in a garden with attendants at Holi festival. Painting, Rajasthan School, mid-18th century.\nThere are two main parts to the festival of Holi. The first part is called Holika Dahan and falls on the night of the full moon during the month of Phalguna, which falls between February and March. Bonfires that have been built with an effigy of Holika on top are lit, recalling the moment that Holika perished in the flames while Prahlada survived. The following day, people gather outside to sing, dance and throw coloured powder and squirt coloured water at one another, which recalls the moment when Krishna rubbed coloured powder onto Radha\u2019s skin. It is a day of fun and jollity when traditional social conventions are disregarded.\nNobleman and woman standing on a terrace and using pichkari to squirt coloured water at one another. Painting, Rajasthan School, mid-19th century.\nThe playful throwing of coloured powder is commonly depicted in miniature paintings, and the British Museum has some beautiful examples. Some show the playful moment between Krishna and Radha, while others depict rulers and their attendants in their palace gardens throwing coloured powder and using long metal syringes called pichkari to squirt coloured water at one another.\nIn 2018, Holi will be celebrated between Thursday 1 March (evening) and Friday 2 March (daytime)."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/worlds-earliest-figural-tattoos-discovered-on-5000-year-old-mummies/", "category": "News", "title": "World's earliest figural tattoos discovered on 5,000-year-old mummies", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2018-03-01 00:00:00", "text": "Dating to between 3351 to 3017 BC, tattoos of animals and motifs have been discovered on two naturally mummified bodies from Egypt.

Only now are we gaining new insights into the lives of these remarkably preserved individuals. Incredibly, at over 5,000 years of age, they push back the evidence for tattooing in Africa by a millennium.\nDaniel Antoine, Curator of Physical Anthropology\nThese naturally mummified individuals are from Egypt\u2019s Predynastic period, the era preceding the country\u2019s unification by the first pharaoh at around 3100 BC. All visible skin on these mummified individuals was examined for signs of body modification as part of a new programme of conservation and research.\nTop: Infrared image of the male mummy known as Gebelein Man A. Lower left: Detail of the\ntattoos observed on his right arm under infrared light. Lower right: The mummy and tattoos under normal lighting conditions.\nThe male mummy, known as \u2018Gebelein Man A\u2019 has been on display in the British Museum almost continuously since his discovery around 100 years ago. Previous CT scans showed that Gebelein Man A was a young man (18\u201321 years of age) when he died from a stab wound to the back.\nDark smudges on his arm, appearing as faint markings under natural light, had\u00a0 remained unexamined. Infrared photography recently revealed that these smudges were in fact tattoos of two slightly overlapping horned animals. The horned animals have been tentatively identified as a wild bull (long tail, elaborate horns) and a Barbary sheep (curving horns, humped shoulder). Both animals are well known in Predynastic Egyptian art. The designs are not superficial and have been applied to the dermis layer of the skin, the pigment was carbon-based, possibly some kind of soot.\nDetail of S-shaped tattoos on Predynastic female mummy from Gebelein.\nThe female mummy, known as \u2018Gebelein Woman\u2019, has several tattoos; a series of four small \u2018S\u2019 shaped motifs can be seen running vertically over her right shoulder. Below them on the right arm is a linear motif which is similar to objects held by figures participating in ceremonial activities on painted ceramics of the same period.\nDetail of stick-shaped tattoo on the right arm of Predynastic female mummy from Gebelein.\nIt may represent a crooked stave, a symbol of power and status, or a throw-stick or baton/clappers used in ritual dance. The \u2018S\u2019 motif also appears on Predynastic pottery decoration, always in multiples.\nA ritual scene painted on a Predynastic pottery jar depicts multiple S-shaped motifs\nand a man holding a curved implement.\nThe application of tattoos to the human body enjoyed a long and diverse history in many ancient cultures. At present the oldest surviving examples are the mainly geometric tattoos on the Alpine mummy known as \u00d6tzi (4th millennium BC) whose skin was preserved by the ice of the Tyrolean Alps. Based on the radiocarbon dates, the Gebelein tattoos are approximately contemporary with \u00d6tzi (3370\u20133100 BC), and can therefore be considered among the earliest surviving tattoos in the world.\nThese finds demonstrate conclusively that tattooing was practised during Egypt\u2019s Predynastic period (c. 4000\u20133100 BC) by both men and women. As the oldest known tattooed figural motifs, they add to our understanding of the range of potential uses of tattoos at the dawn of ancient Egyptian civilisation and expand our view of the practice of tattooing in prehistoric times.\nThe full findings have been published today in the Journal of Archaeological Science."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-british-museum-membercast-transforming-a-gallery/", "category": "Podcasts", "title": "The British Museum Membercast: Transforming a gallery", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2018-02-28 00:00:00", "text": "Stiff competition: an evening of comedy with the Z List Dead List\nThe British Museum Membercast is a monthly podcast made available to \u2018all studious and curious persons\u2019.

The timekeeping function of mechanical timekeepers can be explained as just five elements:\n1. Energy source\nAll machines, including timekeepers, need energy to work. The energy is usually stored in a weight or spring. When it is wound, energy is transferred from our muscles and into the driving weight (as it moves up against the force of gravity) or the mainspring (as it tightens up). This energy is released into the timekeeper as the weight drops or the mainspring unwinds.\nMusical chamber clock by Nicholas Vallin with 3 driving weights and 3 counterweights (needed to stop the rope from slipping), London, 1598.\n2. Wheels\nTwo trains of wheels (timekeeping and striking), of a Japanese stand/lantern clock, 17th\u201318th century.\nAn interconnected series of toothed wheels and pinions, known as a train, transmits the energy through the timekeeper. The energy source moves slowly and the wheel at the furthest end of the train moves quickly. This is the opposite of a car gearbox, where the engine revs quickly and the wheels on the road rotate more slowly.\n3. Escapement\nA verge and crownwheel escapement, on top of a longcase clock movement by Ahasuerus Fromanteel, London, c. 1665.\nThe escapement is connected to the quickly moving end of the train of wheels. Like a turnstile which allows one spectator through at a time, the escapement allows one wheel tooth to pass through (or \u2018escape\u2019) at a time. Without it, the wheels would whiz until the weight hit the floor. The ticking of a timekeeper is the sound of the escapement stopping a wheel tooth.\n4. Controller\nAn early pendulum timepiece\u00a0by J Bernard van Stryp, Antwerp, c. 1660.\nThe controller is connected to the escapement \u2013 it controls the rate at which it allows the teeth to pass through. As each tooth passes the escapement, it gives the controller a little push to keep it going. A common controller is a pendulum, which is just a hanging weight \u2013 give it a push and gravity makes it swing, at a steady rate. Because gravity is essentially constant, pendulums are great for good timekeeping.\n5. Indicator\nThis is the part of the timekeeper that tells us the time, usually hands on a dial. A clock striking a bell gives an aural indication of time \u2013 sometimes from many miles away.\nGilt-brass cased clock-watch with alarm by Hans Schniep. It has a single (hour) hand as a minute hand would be superfluous as the watch was only accurate to about 15 minutes a day. Speyer, Germany, c. 1590\u20131610.\nThese five elements apply to (almost!) all mechanical timekeepers from the most ancient to the modern. They can vary wildly, but are there if you look! Here\u2019s a handy video that takes you through these elements on a Swiss clock in the Museum\u2019s collection:\n\u2026and if you happen to have taken a clock apart, here\u2019s another handy guide on how to put it back together!"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/suffrage-objects-in-the-british-museum/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Suffrage objects in the British Museum", "author": "Benjamin Alsop, Curator of the Citi Money Gallery", "timestamp": "2018-02-23 00:00:00", "text": "In the British Museum archives, on yellowing paper and in compact, neat script, there is an application for admission to the Museum\u2019s Reading Room.

As it housed the British Library (before it moved to Euston Road in 1997) the Museum was a repository for information which could be used to further the suffragists\u2019 cause. However, the prominence of such an august institution also meant that it was a focus for militant suffragette action driven and directed by the WSPU.\nTo commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the Representation of the People Act 1918, which for the first time allowed some women the right to vote, I\u2019ve delved into the Museum\u2019s collection to highlight some of the other objects that relate to the campaign for women\u2019s suffrage.\nThe most evocative set of objects have a direct link with Sylvia Pankhurst.

At its height the group could boast a membership of over 40,000 with women accounting for five out of every six members.\nMetal badge and ribbon of the National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage, 1910\u20131918.\nProbably the best known object in the British Museum collection related to the campaign is the defaced penny currently on display in the Citi Money Gallery (Room 68). The penny was featured in the British Museum and BBC Radio 4 series A History of the World in 100 objects in 2010, and you can find out more about it in the programme itself. As an example of the societal change that has taken place since the defacement of the penny and rather wonderfully using the same medium, an official Royal Mint 50p coin issued in 2003 celebrates the creation of the WSPU.\nSuffragette-defaced penny minted around 1903, and a 50 pence coin from 2003 commemorating the 100th anniversary of the creation of the WSPU.\nSylvia Pankhurst is not the only suffragette who sought access the Museum\u2019s library. A letter from 1894 by former member of the WSPU and founder of the Women\u2019s Freedom League (WFL) Charlotte Despard requests access to the Reading Room to consult local government regulations. Despard\u2019s presence can also be found in the Department of Prints and Drawings which has the largest number of women\u2019s suffrage related objects in the Museum. Despard is immortalised in a portrait print by Flora Lion, a well-known society artist of the first half of the 20th century.\nPhotographic prints of Emily Davies and Millicent Fawcett.\nIn a similar vein, there are photographic portraits of fellow campaigners for female suffrage, Emily Davies and Millicent Fawcett. Davies and Fawcett were committed suffragists, but they represent the more moderate strand of the movement, disapproving of the militant tactics of the WSPU, allying themselves instead with the National Union of Women\u2019s Suffrage Societies (the NUWSS, of which Fawcett was president for over 20 years).\nThe Museum\u2019s collection includes not only portraits of women\u2019s suffrage campaigners but also works by prominent campaigners themselves. There are a number of works by brother and sister Clemence and Laurence Housman \u2013\u00a0both vocal advocates for the suffrage movement and founders of the publishing collective the Suffrage Atelier, which described itself as an \u2018Arts and Crafts Society Working for the Enfranchisement of Women\u2019. Clemence, an illustrator and author, was a supporter of the WSPU and designed banners for the group. Laurence, a writer and artist, was a founder member of the Men\u2019s League for Women\u2019s Suffrage, formed in 1907.\nThe type of banners designed and made by Clemence Housman, which accompanied the many thousand strong marches organised by the WSPU, can be seen in a print by Mary Lanchester. This work records a march that took place on 18\u00a0June 1910 \u2013 video footage of which can be seen in the BFI archives.\nMary Lanchester (1864\u20131935), 18 June 1910. Women\u2019s Suffrage procession, with large numbers of women with banners marching along a London street. Colour woodcut, 1910.\nTwo prints in the Museum\u2019s collection by male artists offer different takes on the state of the suffrage movement at two distinct moments in the early 20th century. William Strang\u2019s print of 1908 shows a distraught woman with arms outstretched as beside her lies a naked female body, the obscured slogan Votes for Women is just about visible on the right-hand side.\nWilliam\u00a0Strang (1859\u20131921), Votes for women. Drypoint, 1908.\nIn contrast, a print produced in 1921 by Theodore Blake Wirgman, three years after the Representation of the People Act, shows a victorious Boadicea (after Thomas Thornycroft\u2019s statue in Westminster) holding a Votes for Women banner as she is crowned by a winged figure.\nTheodore Blake Wirgman (1848\u20131925), Boadicea\u2019s chariot in London, featuring a flag saying \u2018Votes for Women\u2019. Lithograph, 1921.\nFinally I want to highlight a couple of objects which are directly related to two of the suffrage movement\u2019s most iconic figures. The first is a drawing from 1995 by American artist Jacqueline Morreau showing the arrest of Emmeline Pankhurst. The picture takes as its inspiration a famous photograph of Pankhurst being arrested in 1914 after attempting to present a petition to King George V.\nJacqueline Morreau (1929\u20132016), The arrest of Emmeline Pankhurst. Black and white chalk, charcoal and black ink, c. 1982. Reproduced by permission of the artist\u2019s estate.\nThe second and final object isn\u2019t actually in the British Museum\u2019s collection at all. A sari once owned by Sophia Duleep Singh is kindly on loan from Peter Bunce and on display in the Sir Joseph Hotung Gallery of China and South Asia (Room 33). Singh was the daughter of an Indian Maharaja, and she dedicated much of her life to the campaign for women\u2019s rights in the UK. Living in a grace and favour apartment in Hampton Court Palace, she was often seen selling copies of the Suffragette newspaper outside the palace walls.\nThe sari of\u00a0Sophia Duleep Singh on display in Room 33. On loan from Peter Bunce.\nAlthough the British Museum does not hold a particularly large collection of objects relating to the women\u2019s suffrage movement (the Museum of London is the place to go for this) what is held here offers an interesting snapshot of the times. These objects, while often related to particular individuals, are in fact testament to the verve, dynamism and dedication of a mass movement."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/making-connections-black-people-and-cultures-in-asia/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Making connections: black people and cultures in Asia", "author": "Tavian Hunter, Senior Administrator and Librarian in the Department of Asia", "timestamp": "2018-02-22 00:00:00", "text": "The British Museum holds a vast collection related to black heritage where many stories and perspectives of black people and cultures throughout world history can be explored. Working in the Asia Department, I would like to share some of the varied links between black history and Asia that some might find surprising. I have worked with my curatorial colleagues to select six objects that highlight these intriguing connections.\n1. Chinese exports to Africa\nChinese ceramics have been exported throughout the world for hundreds of years. Glazed pottery such as this distinctive jade-green coloured bowl was popular in parts of Africa and notably used as table ware.\nStoneware bowl with green glaze and unglazed centre. Made in Longquan, China, Ming dynasty, c. 1400\u20131500. Found in Malindi, Kenya.\nMade in China during the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) this bowl was found in Malindi, on the coast of Kenya. Malindi was an important centre for trade with the Middle East but also with China and India. It is likely that this bowl travelled from its production kiln site in Longquan and passed through this successful port to enter East Africa. Chinese export porcelain was also used as architectural decoration for the face of tombs along the East African coast at Malindi and Mambrui. Longquan kilns made similar wares for the domestic market in China too.\n2. Dark-skin figures in ancient China\nIn Tang dynasty China (AD 618\u2013907) pottery figures of people and animals were used to furnish tombs for the deceased. The racial identity and occupation of this male tomb figurine with curly hair and dark-skin has confused scholars throughout the years. Is he African or Southeast Asian? A groom or a dancer?\nGreen and brown glazed earthenware figure. Made in China, Tang dynasty, AD 618\u2013906.\nIn 1959, J G Mahler first referred to this figurine as being part of the \u2018K\u2019un-lun boys\u2019. In contemporary Chinese literature, this group were described as having \u2018woolly hair and black skin\u2019 and believed to be from the Malay peninsula. However, this term was also used to describe enslaved Africans sold to China during the Tang dynasty.\nIt is difficult to say for sure if the figure is of African or Southeast Asian descent. However, our curators agree that his hand clenched above the shoulder suggests that he was more likely to be a drummer or a dancer at the head of a procession, instead of a groom for an elephant or lion.\u00a0This figure is on display in the\u00a0Sir Joseph Hotung Gallery of China and South Asia\u00a0(Room 33).\n3. African and Southeast Asian textile traditions\nThe tradition of making batik is well-known in various Southeast Asian countries. This art form of applying a wax resist prior to dyeing fabric is also very popular in West Africa, where it has influenced a variety of cultures and inspired new motifs. This cotton sarong stitched into a tube is decorated in the Javanese batik technique. Produced on the north coast of Java, it draws on patterns and symbols from a variety of sources, including, Java, India, Europe and China.\nA tubular cotton skirt cloth (sarong). Java, 1880\u20131913.\nThere is a similar cloth in the Museum\u2019s collection of African textiles, which has design motifs inspired by this Javanese batik for African markets. If you compare the two cloths, you can see many similarities in design.\nSample of machine woven cotton cloth decorated using the batik method. Made in Manchester. Found in West Africa.\nInterestingly, the African textile was made in Beving\u2019s Manchester-based textile company, Blakeley & Beving Co. However, it was likely sold back to African markets where it was subsequently found in West Africa. The Charles Beving collection forms one of most important collections of 19th- and early 20th-century African textiles in the British Museum. You can find out more about some key objects in the Sainsbury African Galleries (Room 25) in this blog post.\n4. North Korean art and the African-American struggle\nThere are many depictions of black people in North Korean art. In Africa, many of the large-scale sculptures and monuments dedicated to famous independence leaders have been made by North Korean artists. These relics of the engagement remain today as Pyongyang continues to portray warm relations with African nations through art. However, more frequently African-Americans can be seen present in North Korean propaganda imagery. It seems their presence in art is to display solidarity against inequality and American policies.\nChoi Langsong and Ko Youngchol, From Mt Paektu to Mt Hanla. Linocut print, 1990.\nThis woodblock print in the collection shows an African-American man marching alongside Korean activist Lim Sugyong in front of the map of Korea. On 31 July 1989, the Chicago Tribune reported that Lim led a march of \u2018some 300 activist from about 30 countries\u2019. As part of the National Leaders of the University Students Association, they hold a banner that reads \u2018Our nation is one. Our wish is unification\u2019 expressing their desire for Korean unification during the 7th International Youth Student Festival, 1989.\nAs the composition of this print is similar to photographs of the march, while the identity of the man is still a mystery, his presence and participation is certain. Africans and African-Americans continue to appear in North Korean imagery to represent an international camaraderie.\n5. Afros in Japanese art\nTetsuya Noda is a unique Japanese artist who specialises in woodblock prints and a series of silkscreened diary entries. This print from his Diary series titled Sept. 13th \u201973 represents a visual snapshot of a moment in his daily life.\nNoda Tetsuya (b. 1940), Diary: Sept. 13th \u201973. Four-colour lithograph on Arches paper, 1973. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nAt first glance, this appears to be a half-length portrait of an African-American woman wearing her hair styled in an afro, and wearing a white t-shirt with a design of a woman\u2019s bare breasts. For me, this really invokes thoughts about second-wave feminism in the US during 1970s and the portrayal of a woman in control of her own body. The hairstyle is also evocative of the iconic image of activist Angela Davis, who wore her in a picked out afro.\nHowever, as fascinating as this print may be, the racial identity of the woman becomes subjective and ambiguous in nature the longer you observe it. Originally, nothing was known about this young woman. However, a trip to Japan to visit the artist in October 2017 has revealed that the young woman in the image is in fact Israeli. She is the niece of a friend of the artist in Israel and she is wearing what was the latest fashion from USA.\n6. African kings in Bengal\nThere are many stories of the African diaspora in medieval India. The reign of the Bengal Sultan Rukn al-Din Barbak Shah (1459\u20131474), saw the arrival of a large number of enslaved Abyssinians (from modern-day Ethiopia), as well as soldiers and military administrators, brought by the sultan to serve in his army. Some would go on to hold positions of power, including Sayf al-Din Firuz Shah who became a Bengal sultan. A former army commander, Sayf al-Din was of Ethiopian descent, and ruled from 1487 to 1489.\nBasalt frieze with part of an inscription with the titles of the Bengal Sultan Sayf al-Din Firuz Shah (r.\u00a01487\u20131489).\nThis fragmentary inscription, carved in a style of calligraphy typical of Bengal, bears the sultan\u2019s titles. It reads, \u2018may God perpetuate his kingdom and authority\u2019. It comes from the doorway of one of Gaur\u2019s most famous monuments, the Firuz Minar, from which the call to prayer was announced.\u00a0The frieze is on display in the newly refurbished Sir Joseph Hotung Gallery of China and South Asia\u00a0(Room 33).\nI am grateful to my colleagues Jessica Harrison-Hall (Head of China Section), Yi Chen (Curator: Early Chinese Collections), Alexandra Green (Henry Ginsburg Curator for Southeast Asia), Eleanor S Hyun (Curator: Korean Collections), Timothy Clark (Head of Japanese Section), Alfred Haft (JTI Project Curator for Japanese Collections) and Imma Ramos (Curator: South Asia Collections) for their assistance in writing this post."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/from-history-with-love-14-objects-to-get-you-in-the-mood-for-valentines-day/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "From history, with love... 14 objects to get you in the mood for Valentine's Day", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2018-02-13 00:00:00", "text": "From Rodin\u2019s masterpiece The Kiss to more secret signs of courtship and love of all kinds, let history and art sweep you off your feet this 14 February. Kissing might be a symbol of love in many parts of the world today, but that\u2019s not always been the case \u2013 and even today it\u2019s not a universal sign of romantic love. Read on to find out more\u2026\n1. Auguste Rodin\u2019s The Kiss\nAuguste Rodin (1840\u20131917), The Kiss. Plaster, after 1898. S. 174. \u00a9 Mus\u00e9e Rodin. Photo: Adam Rzepka.\nNow one of the most famous kisses in the world, Rodin never actually intended for this sculptural masterpiece to be a romantic one. The couple represents Paolo and Francesca from Renaissance poet Dante Alighieri\u2019s epic poem Divine Comedy \u2013 a pair of tragic lovers Dante meets in his travels through hell. The cursed couple were murdered by Francesca\u2019s husband (Paolo\u2019s brother) after he discovered the lovers together. This sculpture depicts them lost in reckless passion at the very moment of their untimely demise. Keen-eyed readers may have noticed that this isn\u2019t from the British Museum collection. However, you\u2019ll be able to see this work at the Museum alongside other Rodin masterpieces on loan from\u00a0Mus\u00e9e Rodin in our major Rodin exhibition opening in April.\n2. Paolo and Francesca by Dante Gabriel Rossetti\nDante Gabriel Rossetti (1828\u20131882), study of Paolo and Francesca da Rimini. Graphite, c. 1855.\nRodin wasn\u2019t the only artist captivated by this tragic story \u2013 Paolo and Francesca also appear in this graphite drawing by Pre-Raphaelite Dante Gabriel Rossetti, again locked in loving embrace. Rossetti\u2019s interest in Dante Alighieri was predestined: his father had been so fascinated by the poet that he named his son after him!\n3. Torii Kiyonaga\u2019s kissing lovers\nTorii Kiyonaga (1752\u20131815), Sode no maki (Handscroll for the Sleeve). Woodblock print, c. 1785.\nWhile on the subject of loving embraces, this detail of two lovers kissing is from a woodblock print by Japanese artist Torii Kiyonaga made about 1785. The print is part of a set perhaps originally intended to be mounted together as a handscroll. An example of\u00a0shunga\u00a0\u2013 Japanese erotic art \u2013\u00a0the set describes the full gamut of sexual intercourse: from the anticipation, to the moments of high passion, right through to the slumber that follows.\n4. Persian miniature depicting lovers in a garden\nLovers painted in the style of Abd Allah. Ink, opaque watercolour and gold on paper, Bukhara, c. 1560\u20131570.\n\u2018A heart without love is a body without a soul. A soul lives forever because of love.\u2019 So wrote the Persian poet, scholar and mystic, Jami (1414\u20131492), on love \u2013 of all subjects, perhaps the most universal to humanity. In Persianate culture, the theme of love has permeated literature, art and music for thousands of years. This 16th-century painting in ink, watercolour and gold depicts two lovers in a garden.\n5. Indian miniature depicting Krishna and Radha\nPainting depicting Krishna and Radha. India, c. 1800.\nArtists often depicted romantic moments in Indian miniature paintings, proving that no love is too small to warrant celebration. Like the Persian artwork above, this beautiful miniature from 19th-century India depicts two figures in a green-filled landscape. This time, however, the pair represent the Hindu gods Krishna and Radha, accompanied by a female musician and a cow.\n6. A relief depicting the king and queen of Assyria reclining in a garden\nAssyrian relief of a banqueting scene. North Palace, Nineveh, Iraq. 645\u2013635 BC.\nFrom gods to royalty \u2013\u00a0this Assyrian relief shows a romantic scene between a besotted king and his queen. It may depict Queen Libbali-Sharrat sitting opposite her husband King Ashurbanipal (668\u2013c. 630 BC). This rare example of an Assyrian relief featuring a female figure depicts the couple under a grape vine surrounded by a lush garden. Maids fan the royal couple, while servants play music and bring food. Try to spot the subtle reminders of past wars, including a severed head! (Generally not recommended as a Valentine\u2019s Day gift today.)\n7.\u00a0Etruscan painting of two men, as reproduced in a 19th-century copy on canvas\nDetail from a wall-painting from the Tomba delle Bighe (Tomb of the Chariots), Tarquinia, reproduced in a 19th-century copy.\nAncient Greek and Roman attitudes to sex and sexuality were in many ways very different to the modern era. People were sexually active \u2013 and girls married \u2013 at an earlier age. Sexual relationships between males were accepted within certain boundaries, but the modern term\u00a0homosexual\u00a0had no Greek or Latin equivalent. This scene is from a\u00a0wall-painting\u00a0in an ancient Etruscan tomb\u00a0of about 490\u2013480 BC\u00a0known as the Tomb of the Chariots,\u00a0in\u00a0Tarquinia, Italy.\u00a0This detail was part of a much larger scene, copied on to canvas in a 19th-century reproduction, most of which is now lost.\u00a0The surviving remains of the original wall-paintings from the tomb are now in the Museo Nazionale di Tarquinia.\u00a0The Etruscans were greatly influenced by the contemporary Greeks but they had their own distinctive character, which in turn influenced the neighbouring Italian peoples, including the Romans.\n8.\u00a0Ancient Egyptian relief of a mother and child\nLimestone relief carving of a woman suckling a child. Late 18th Dynasty, about 1350\u20131330 BC, El-Amarna, Egypt.\nA parent\u2019s love for their child is another enduring during theme through history. This limestone relief made nearly 2,500 years ago depicts a mother nursing her child: the intimacy and informality of this scene is rare in ancient Egypt, and may have been a preparatory sketch for a wall carving. The family unit and procreation of children was highly regarded in Egyptian society, enabling the life cycle to continue and thus allowing the dead to live on in memory.\n9. Medal of Leonello d\u2019Este\nMedal of Leonello d\u2019Este, designed and modelled by Pisanello (1395\u20131455). Italy, 1444.\nWhat would love be without the quintessential serenade? The relationship between love and music is a long-standing one, as demonstrated in this rare 15th-century medal from Italy. On it, Leonello, the soon to be son-in-law of the King of Aragon, is taught to sing a song of love by Cupid in preparation for his wedding in 1444. The lion represents Leonello himself \u2013 a play on his name. Music was very much valued at the d\u2019Este court in Ferrara, which may have served as inspiration for the imagery.\n10. Medieval lovers\u2019 brooch\nLovers\u2019 brooch. Made in France or England, 13th century.\nTokens of love have always been big business. This medieval gold brooch, set with rubies and sapphires, was a gift intended to be passed between lovers. The back of the brooch carries an inscription in Old French for the benefit of the wearer: \u2018Io sui ici en lui dami: Amo\u2019 (I am here in place of the friend I love). Items of jewellery with sentimental inscriptions like this were often exchanged between wealthy lovers in the medieval period.\n11. Navajo blanket\nBlanket made by Navajo, Southwest Peoples. Arizona, c. 1855.\nBut what about when love can\u2019t be expressed openly? Many cultures through history have eschewed open displays or proclamations of love. These blankets made by Navajo Peoples of North America were used across the Great Plains to shelter lovers from indiscreet eyes during courtship. They were valued items and are represented in picture writing by Plains Indians of the 19th century.\n12. East African kangas\n\u2018The Mangoes are ready\u2019. Kanga made in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, c. 2002.\n\u2018I don\u2019t\u2019 say much, but I have a lot in my heart\u2019. Kanga made in Mombasa, Kenya, 2003.\nToday many millions of east African women wear pairs of kangas over their everyday dresses \u2013 but they are much more important than simply items of clothing. In Swahili society it is not always easy for women to say out loud what they feel, and so they use kangas to speak on their behalf. Kangas allow women to communicate among themselves, as well as with men, to express a wide range of feelings and concerns, many of which are in the context of intimate social, courting and conjugal relationships.\n13. Gold pendant of Cupid and Psyche\nGold pendant set with a shell cameo of Cupid and Psyche, made by John Brogden (c. 1796\u20131884). Cameo made c. 1826\u20131875 in Italy and setting made c. 1870 in England.\nHow could we have an article about Valentine\u2019s Day without including one of the most famous symbols of love? This gold pendant is set with a shell cameo of Cupid and Psyche and decorated with ivy-leaf ornament. Sold by London jewellers firm of John Brogden, this intricate ornament might have been intended as a wedding gift, making references to love (Cupid and Psyche) and fidelity (the ivy).\n14. Terracotta depicting Psyche and Eros\nTerracotta busts of Eros and Psyche embracing, from the interior of a vessel. Centuripe, Sicily, c. 200\u2013100 BC.\nPsyche also takes centre stage in this terracotta made in Sicily over 2,000 years ago. Psyche (Soul) was a princess so beautiful that people mistook her for the goddess of love Aphrodite.\u00a0Enraged by jealousy, Aphrodite ordered her son Eros (sexual desire) to shoot Psyche with an arrow charged with a spell to make the princess fall in love with a hideous beast. In typical Greek myth fashion, this plan backfires for Aphrodite, as Eros falls for Psyche instead. Here Psyche turns to gaze at her lover, their lips about to meet.\nIf all that talk of love has left you wanting more, check out Lloyd de Beer\u2019s blog post on even more objects featuring love, sex and desire."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/a-processional-chariot-from-south-india/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "A processional chariot from south India", "author": "Richard Blurton, Head, South and Southeast Asia Section", "timestamp": "2018-02-08 00:00:00", "text": "In 1792, at auction rooms in London, the Indian collection of David Simpson went under the hammer. One of the more remarkable items was a large-scale model of a south Indian processional chariot, which was acquired by Charles Marsh, who gave it to the British Museum the following year.\nThis fascinating object was displayed on the North stairs in the 1980s and, more recently, published in a 2010 catalogue of south Indian paintings at the Museum. It has also been seen in the exhibitions Deities and devotion: the arts of Hinduism (1993), and Living with gods (until 8 April 2018). This blog and a lecture at the Museum on Friday 16 February 2018 at 13.30\u00a0will we hope bring this remarkable object to the attention of many more people.\nProcessional chariot (ratha) from Shrirangam, south India, 18th century.\nThere is a long-standing tradition in South Asia of mobile architecture. This takes the form of chariots with images of the gods installed in them \u2013 examples are known from Nepal in the north, to the Tamil country in the south, and many places in between. This type of chariot, known as a ratha, is dragged through the streets at festival time so devotees can view the deities.\nDavid Simpson was stationed for the East India Company at Tiruchchirapalli south of modern Chennai, on the banks of the Kaveri river. The island in the middle of the river is the location of the famous temple of Shrirangam, dedicated to the god Vishnu. Simpson would almost certainly have seen how this type of chariot was used, commissioned a model of one, and brought it back to England.\nDetail of some of the figures on the ratha.\nThe model chariot is 2.2 metres high and is made up of two parts \u2013 an upper, open structure, part of which is decorated with coloured textiles, and a lower, solid part made up of a platform with rows of wooden panels below decorated with scenes taken from the mythology of Vishnu. It is on the platform of the actual chariot that the image of the deity, accompanied by consort(s) and offspring, would have been placed so as to be visible as the chariot was pulled through the streets of Shrirangam. While the chariot\u00a0at Shrirangam would have been one of the most impressive, all south Indian temples of note used (and still use) chariots in the annual cycle of festivals.\nA chariot procession. The foreground shows the temple chariot, pulled by devotees as an act of worship. Gouache painting, Company School, painted in Thanjavur, late 18th\u2013early 19th century.\nIn southern India the images of the gods that are placed in the chariots and drawn through the streets are usually made of bronze \u2013 these are the famous bronze images that, during the Chola period (c. 8th\u201312th centuries) are today considered by some to be the very finest bronze figural sculptures ever made using the lost wax process. While the processional images are bronze, the main image of the deity in the temple is invariably made of stone and never moves.\nOpaque watercolour painting of the Ranganatha temple at Shrirangam, Tamil Nadu. It is depicted on its island site in the Kaveri River. At the centre is the main shrine of the temple. Company School, painted in Thanjavur, c. 1830.\nThe chariot model prepared for David Simpson may never have had an image of the deity \u2013 if it did, it doesn\u2019t survive today. What we do see though is a bolster set on a wooden throne-platform against which the image would have been placed, along with several model attendants, one of whom holds a parasol above where the image would have been. The image at the temple at Shrirangam is of Vishnu in his form as Ranganatha (the deity lying on the cosmic serpent, Ananta) and we must imagine that the image of the deity that was envisaged for this chariot would have been of Vishnu in this form.\nThe chariot is undoubtedly magnificent even today when more than 200 years has had some effect on the textile elements, but why was it made? It must have been commissioned by Europeans as it has no ritual use, so we should perhaps look at the intellectual climate in Europe for an explanation, rather than in India. Charles Marsh, who had bought the ratha at auction, was a friend of Charles Townley, a famous collector of Roman sculpture, whose collection is now in the British Museum. In the late 18th century, in the decades after the major discoveries at Pompeii, Roman life was being intellectually examined by Europeans. Many facets of ancient Roman life seemed inexplicable, indeed positively bawdy, and many collectors and writers began to look elsewhere to understand features such as the frequent use of phallic imagery. One place they began to investigate was India \u2013 could traditional Indian society provide a living model for certain puzzling features of ancient life that were apparent in the excavations at Pompeii?\nCopper-alloy figure of Vishnu reclining on the multi-headed serpent Ananta. From Shrirangam, 18th century. Donated to the Museum by Charles Townley.\nWe know that Townley bought a number of Indian paintings and objects from the Simpson sale and we can only assume that these formed part of his attempt to better understand antiquity as demonstrated in his own collection. Interestingly, as far as the history of the chariot is concerned, among the bronze objects acquired by Townley was a sculpture of Ranganatha Vishnu. Could this even be the one that was originally prepared for the model chariot? We will probably never know.\nThe chariot model has much to tell us about southern India in the late 18th century and about the continuity of the traditions of mobile architecture in that region, up to the present. However, it also intriguingly points towards the intellectual questioning of ancient Mediterranean culture at the same period.

About 8.4 million women gained the vote. It would be a further 10 years until the Representation of the People Act 1928 gave the vote to all women over the age of 21, on the same terms as men.\nMy book Rise Up, Women! The Remarkable Lives of the Suffragettes is a group biography of more than 200 suffragettes, all members of the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union (WSPU), who waged a militant campaign for the vote from 1903 to the outbreak of the war in 1914. The book throws new light on women of all classes, all parts of the country, and many life experiences, who gave their days and years so that women could have the vote, become MPs, have a career, join the professions, make laws. The recent revelations about the lack of equal pay, and sexual harassment across the entire workforce, shows there is still so much work to do before women enjoy full equality with men. Rise Up, Women! brings new faces and new stories to reveal a broader and deeper impression of who these remarkable women were.\nMembers of the WSPU outside the \u2018rush trial\u2019 of Emmeline Pankhurst, Christabel Pankhurst and Flora Drummond at Bow Street Magistrates Court in October 1908.\nFast forward through the vivid, dangerous, sometimes comic and often painful ten-year suffragette narrative and take a closer look at the spring of 1914, a time of unprecedented vandalism, smashing windows and burning empty houses, sports facilities and churches, and attacks on works of art and museum displays, when the suffragettes were personae non grata throughout the country, deeply disliked by almost everyone, stalked by Special Branch, and often assaulted by members of the public.\nMale medical students were especially troublesome and would attack these women and smash up their shops and offices. Faced with the intransigence and duplicitous behaviour of the government and the torture of women who went on hunger strike in prison and were fed by force, membership of the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union\u2019s campaign was not for the faint-hearted.\nSUFFRAGETTES AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM.

She smashed a display case in the Asiatic Saloon and broke three Chinese porcelain cups and a saucer. Dressed in a \u2018long tweed costume over which she wore a long coat\u2019 Clara appeared to be studying the antiquities, when \u2018she produced a brand new hatchet from beneath her coat and before the attendants could seize her, belaboured the cabinet of porcelain\u2019.\nAt Bow Street Court the next morning Clara \u2018in a very excited manner began to shout and declaim\u2019 to the magistrate. She told him she had not come to listen to him, refused to recognise the authority of the court, and told him she would not sit down while Mrs Pankhurst and others were being tortured by the \u2018devilish\u2019 work of the Home Secretary, Reginald McKenna. Clara was taken from the court and the case was adjourned until the afternoon, but when she returned she was \u2018disorderly and continued speaking loudly\u2019 while two officers held her firmly in the dock.\nLeft: Poster by A Patriot, showing a suffragette prisoner being force fed, 1910.

On 24 April Scotland Yard circulated a memorandum to all police stations in the country featuring a Special Branch surveillance photograph of her, giving her details: she was five feet one inch tall, had a sallow complexion, brown hair and grey eyes. Clara was 40 years old, had two convictions for breaking windows, and had recently been found in the House of Commons \u2018in male attire with a riding whip in her coat pocket\u2026 for an unlawful purpose.\u2019\nThe Scotland Yard memorandum featuring Mary Raleigh Richardson and Clara Mary Lambert (Catherine Wilson) by an unknown photographer.

Her hunger strike medal has three silver bars giving the dates of her force feeding in 1912, 1913 and 1914.\nMILITANT OUTRAGES\u2026 MUMMY CASE SMASHED AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM\nDaily Mirror\nTwo suffragettes went on a mission to the British Museum on 23 May 1914: Nellie Hay, a Scottish woman, and her accomplice, Annie Wheeler. Even though the women were kept under close observation, one of them smashed a glass case containing a mummy. They were charged with malicious damage. Nellie Hay was also charged with obstructing the police and was sentenced to one month in prison. Annie Wheeler was to serve two months and went on hunger and thirst strike and was force fed and released just a few days before the end of her sentence in July. Two days later the British Museum announced that in future women would only be admitted to the galleries by ticket on condition they produced a \u2018satisfactory recommendation from a person willing to be responsible for their behaviour.\u2019\nNews of the attack on the mummy case prompted the National Gallery, the Wallace Collection and the Tate Gallery to close their buildings until further notice. The Standard described how American women wishing to visit the National Gallery had to be accompanied by an Embassy secretary. The Tate Gallery and Wallace Collection insisted on a letter of recommendation from public officials such as ambassadors, MPs and judges, accepting \u2018all responsibility for the acts of the bearer\u2019.\nSuffrage poster depicting an issue of the periodical The Suffragette with a figure of a woman Justice clad in armour bearing a banner labelled WSPU.\nWriting Rise Up, Women! I wanted to know what became of the suffragettes when the militant campaign was suspended at the outbreak of the First World War. I am curious about their \u2018afterlives\u2019, what they did during the war when everyone was expected to \u2018do their bit\u2019, how they rebuilt broken family ties and how they earned a living. Giving so much of oneself to a dangerous and unpopular political campaign at the height of their powers, it might have proved difficult for the suffragettes to return to a \u2018normal\u2019 life and get a job.\nClara Lambert lobbied for food rationing during the War, and in 1915 she joined Maud Allen\u2019s Women\u2019s Police Service and was sent to do welfare work with women munition workers in South Wales, and there met her lifelong companion Violet Croxford. Violet had been a nurse at the Manor Asylum in Epsom before war broke out. In the 1920s Clara did rescue work with young girls in London, and in 1926 the couple opened a hostel in Hythe, Kent, for \u2018unfortunate ladies.\u2019 Clara died in Surrey, in 1969, aged 94. It has proved impossible to find out any information on Nellie Hay and Annie Wheeler, the mummy case-smashers, or even if these were their real names.\nRise Up, Women!

The closest that most of us get to this sensation is searching for something on our phones, but for the real deal, there\u2019s nothing quite like an astrolabe. These devices \u2013 which range from pocket-sized and practical to weighty presentation pieces \u2013 are not only scientific instruments, but also masterpieces of art and design.\nIn October 2018 the Museum will open two new galleries \u2013\u00a0the Albukhary Foundation Galleries of the Islamic world. On display will be a range of scientific material. In preparation for this exciting new development, I\u2019ve been taking a fresh look at astronomy and astrology and wanted to share some of the highlights with you.\nNowadays we have an abundance of devices, apps and other information which help us to know where we are, what time it is, and other essentials of everyday life. Before all this, however, was the astrolabe. Astrolabes are complex devices which use several moving parts to turn raw data provided by the user into practical information \u2013 in many ways, they were the computers of their time, used to solve problems relating to the position of the sun, stars, planets and timekeeping. In the 10th\u00a0century, one astronomer estimated that there were around a thousand possible applications for an astrolabe, ranging from the position of the stars or the direction of Mecca to the height of a building. The name is derived from the Greek astro labos (star-taker), which points to the fact that they were probably invented in ancient Greece, before being transmitted into the Islamic world from the 7th\u00a0century AD onwards.\nKnowledge of the skies, now called astronomy, was an important aspect of Islamic culture from earliest times. Scientists and thinkers in the Islamic world built on Babylonian, Greek, Indian and pre-Islamic Arabian sources translated into Arabic to make huge advances in the study of the heavens. Astronomy today is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena \u2013 stars, planets, the moon, comets, and eclipses. Muslim astronomers, driven by such needs as determining prayer times and the direction of Mecca, developed and refined scientific instruments to cater to these requirements, including the astrolabe.\nAn astrolabe is made up of four key elements \u2013 rete, plates, mater, and alidade. The rete sits at the front of the device, acting as a map of the heavens with each pointer picking out a particular star. This can be rotated to reflect what the user sees in the sky \u2013 a particular star, or the sun, for example. An astrolabe will normally have several plates held within it, which can be swapped depending on how far north or south the user is. The rete and plates sit inside the mater, the back of which is engraved to verify times, dates, signs of the zodiac and other information. This is done using the alidade, a kind of ruler on the back of the astrolabe which is used to work out information.\nAstrolabe made by Abd al-Karim al-Misri/al-Madrabi, brass with silver and copper inlay, AH633 (1236AD), probably Mayyafariqin (Turkey)\nThis example, heavily inlaid with silver and copper, features striking figural imagery on its front and back. It is signed Abd al-Karim al-Asturlabi (the Astrolabist) and the titles of three possible royal patrons \u2013 al-Malik, al-Mu\u2018izz and Shihab al-Din \u2013 have also been engraved on the back. This elite patronage, its large size and extensive decoration suggest that it was a presentation piece meant to be admired rather than used.\nMade for the last Safavid ruler of Iran, Shah Sultan Husayn (r. 1694\u20131722), this is an exceptionally large instrument. Although astrolabes were usually designed to be portable, this one is so heavy that it was probably only meant for use in one place \u2013 possibly a mosque built or renovated by the ruler himself. The leafy design of the star pointers may refer to the gardens of paradise, linking the skies to heaven itself. Originally in the collection of Sir Hans Sloane, this was one of the first Islamic objects in the British Museum\u2019s collection.\nAstrolabe made by Abd Ali ibn Muhammad Rafi al-Juzi and decorated by Muhammad Baqir. Brass with silver inlay, Iran, Sha\u2019ban AH 1124 (September/October AD 1712).\nHaving passed from ancient Greece into the Islamic world, astrolabes eventually became part of European scientific culture. Made for use at Spanish sites from Ibiza to Zaragoza, this astrolabe features both Arabic and Latin script.\nCopper-alloy astrolabe, maker unknown. Spain, 1200\u20131400.\nThe Latin was added at a later date \u2013 a neat metaphor for Europe basing its scientific knowledge on Islamic foundations, much of which passed north across the Pyrenees and into western Europe around the time that this instrument was made. In fact, the first technical manual in English \u2013 written in 1391 by none other than Geoffrey Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales \u2013 is a treatise on the use of astrolabes.\nThe British Museum\u2019s new Albukhary Foundation Galleries of the Islamic world will open in October 2018."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/reading-margery-kempes-inner-voices/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Reading Margery Kempe\u2019s inner voices", "author": "Charles Fernyhough, Professor of Psychology at the University of Durham", "timestamp": "2018-01-17 00:00:00", "text": "The exhibition Living with gods: peoples, places and worlds beyond\u00a0contains many poignant and powerful reminders of the persistence and value of prayer. Whether uttered silently or aloud, words of devotion form part of a dialogue with a being whose existence can be understood (or denied) in different ways. In that sense, they are of great interest to psychologists, who have sometimes examined them as an example of \u2018inner speech\u2019, the silent conversations that many of us report accompanying our daily lives. Without having to commit to any metaphysics or deny their spiritual meaning, psychologists like me can try to understand the processes through which we conduct internal dialogues with varied conversational partners, whether they be absent friends, the voices of the dead, imaginary entities or supernatural beings.\nAdriaen Collaert (c. 1560\u20131618), Plate 6 from the series The Life of Teresa of Avila showing Teresa hearing God\u2019s voice. Engraving, 1613.\nMy research in the last few years has had a particular focus on these internal dialogues. I\u2019m interested in how all these words get into our heads, what they are doing there, and what the experience of inner speech is like. An often distressing counterpart to these ordinary internal conversations is the experience of hearing voices when no one is present \u2013 often seen as a sign of severe mental illness (such as schizophrenia) but also associated with a range of other psychiatric diagnoses. Outside the psychiatric clinic, researchers are now beginning to understand that hearing voices is a part of everyday life for a significant minority of people who are not distressed by their experiences and who are not mentally ill. Casting the net even wider, somewhere between 5 and 15 per cent of the population will have occasional, fleeting voice-hearing experiences, such as hearing one\u2019s name called when there is no one around.\nHearing voices is a part of human experience that crosses continents and historical periods. In my lecture as part of the public programme of events related to the exhibition, I will focus on a figure who left such a rich description of her experiences that it still resonates with us 600 years later. Margery Kempe was a colourful figure. A mother of fourteen who had failed in business twice, she took to the road in her forties to try to persuade princes and bishops that she was hearing the voice of God. It was a dangerous path to tread. Margery wrote about her experiences (by dictating them to an amanuensis) in a unique manuscript, The Book of Margery Kempe, now housed in the British Library. This extraordinary text is thought to be the first autobiography in the English language.\nAndrzej Jackowski (b. 1947), Hearing Voices IV, 1993.\u00a0Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nIn our Hearing the Voice project based at Durham University and funded by the Wellcome Trust, we are engaging with Margery\u2019s text from a range of different disciplinary perspectives, using methods from the humanities to explore the nuances of her account and their significance for scientific theorising. Sometimes Margery hears the voice of God as clearly as if there had been another person in the room with her. At other times, the experience is more ambiguous \u2013 the Holy Spirit announces itself to her as a rushing sound, like a pair of bellows, or as the sound of a robin or a dove. On one occasion a voice counsels Margery to travel to the nearby city of Norwich \u2013 then the second biggest city in England \u2013 to take advice on her experiences from \u2018Dame Julian\u2019. This is a reference to the celebrated mystic Julian of Norwich, author of Revelations of Divine Love, the first book in English known to have been written by a woman. Just as voice-hearers today \u2013 often inspired by the international Hearing Voices Movement \u2013 get together to discuss their experiences away from the diagnosing eye of psychiatry, so these two literary giants spent \u2018many days\u2019 together in \u2018holy dalyawns\u2019 in and around Julian\u2019s anchorite\u2019s cell. I like to think of the meeting in Norwich, somewhere around the year 1415, as the first hearing voices group.\nInterdisciplinary research is sometimes put forward as the sole pathway to a higher truth. The reality is that it frequently fails, for reasons such as the time and effort involved in bringing researchers from different disciplines into a shared body of understanding, while at the same time respecting and valuing disciplinary expertise. I can honestly say that reading and thinking about Margery Kempe, along with the works of her commentators such as Corinne Saunders, Barry Windeatt and Anthony Bale, has changed the way I think scientifically about inner speech and voice-hearing. In her account of her \u2018wondirful revelacyons\u2019, Margery Kempe gives us a resonant image of what her modern editor Barry Windeatt has called \u2018a praying mind talking to itself\u2019.\nCharles Fernyhough is the author of The Voices Within: The history and science of how we talk to ourselves (UK: Profile Books/Wellcome Collection; US: Basic Books).\nThe exhibition\u00a0Living with gods: peoples, places and worlds beyond\u00a0is on from 2 November 2017 to 8 April 2018.\nSupported by the Genesis Foundation.

Rodin\u2019s life is well documented and his art remains famous and reproduced across the world. By contrast, Pheidias\u2019 life is recorded only in passing by Roman commentators who lived 500 years after his death, and most of his art is lost to the ravages of time. But there are some striking similarities.\nRodin and Pheidias. Portrait of Rodin. \u00a9 Mus\u00e9e Rodin. Photo: Jean de Calan. The painting of Pheidias is from the Study for Pheidias in \u2018The Apotheosis of Homer\u2019 by Ingres, San Diego Museum of Art.\nBoth artists were the\u00a0most famous sculptors\u00a0of their lifetimes. Despite living centuries apart, Rodin wrote and spoke as if he knew Pheidias personally. Seeing his hand at work in the sculptures of the Parthenon, Rodin imagined Pheidias as a friend and teacher who guided his hand as he created representations of the human form.\nNo artist will ever surpass Pheidias\u2026 The greatest of the sculptors, who appeared at the time when the entire human dream could be contained in the pediment of a temple, will never be equalled.\nAuguste Rodin, 1911\nLike Pheidias, Rodin did not personally carve everything that we put his name to. Rodin was sometimes seen posing for the camera with hammer and chisel in hand, but he did not carve in marble himself. He preferred to model figures in clay, and then have them cast in plaster or bronze. If he was working in marble, he would delegate the task of copying the clay model to a stone carver under his personal control. In this, his practice may not have been very different from that of Pheidias. It is most unlikely that Pheidias would have carved any part of the architectural sculpture of the Parthenon, but he very probably designed it, fashioning models and making drawings for the pediment and frieze.\nSometimes we can see Rodin\u2019s admiration for Pheidias at work in compositions that have not always been acknowledged. One such example is the comparison between the pose of a figure in the cavalcade of the Parthenon frieze and Rodin\u2019s The Age of Bronze.\nBlock XLVII (figs. 132\u2013136) of unmounted youths preparing for the cavalcade from the north frieze of the Parthenon, c. 438\u2013432 BC.

But by placing\u00a0The Kiss\u00a0together with these figures (below, likely of goddesses) from the east pediment of the Parthenon, we see almost for the first time the miraculous ability of both Rodin and Pheidias to conjure warm flesh out of cold marble.\nFigures L and M of goddesses in diaphanous drapery from the east pediment of the Parthenon, c. 438\u2013432 BC.

The one is raising herself from her seat, the other strides out of the exhibition into a different world, that of modernism and abstract expressionism. In Walking Man, we can see how Rodin radically lopped off the head of his own sculpture in order to make it more like the Parthenon sculptures.\nFigure K of a goddess from the east pediment of the Parthenon, c. 438\u2013432 BC.

He worked mostly in Athens but also transferred his workshop to Olympia, where he constructed in gold and ivory the colossal gold and ivory seated Zeus \u2013 one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.\nA history of the building\nThe Parthenon has a long and complex history. The building was altered and the sculptures were damaged over the course of the centuries. It began nearly 2,500 years ago as a temple dedicated to Athena.\nAround AD 500 it was converted into a Christian church (the church of the Virgin Mary of the Athenians) and remained so for a thousand years. At this time, the whole of the middle section of the east pediment was removed, destroying a dozen statues. Part of the east frieze was taken down, and almost all of the metopes on the east, north and west sides were deliberately defaced.\nWilliam Pars (c. 1742\u20131782), detail of the east front of the Parthenon with a mosque behind. Pen and grey ink and watercolour, with bodycolour, over graphite, 1765.\nMainland Greece was conquered by the Ottoman empire\u00a0by 1460 and the building became a mosque in the early 1460s. When Athens was under siege by the Venetians in 1687, the Parthenon was used as a gunpowder store. A huge explosion blew the roof off and destroyed a large portion of the remaining sculptures. The building has been a ruin ever since.\nThe sculptures as museum objects\nBy 1800 only about half of the original sculptural decoration remained.\u00a0From 1801, after obtaining permission from the Ottoman authorities, the British ambassador to the Ottoman empire Lord Elgin removed about half of the remaining sculptures from the fallen ruins and the building.\nElgin was passionate about ancient Greek art and transported the sculptures to Britain at his own expense. Their arrival in London made a profound impression upon European art and taste,\u00a0at a time when\u00a0the European Enlightenment was revising its idea of what art should be.\nArchibald Archer, The Temporary Elgin Room constructed to display the Parthenon sculptures, with portraits of staff, a trustee and visitors. Oil painting on canvas, 1819.\nThese sculptures were first seen from 1807 in Lord Elgin\u2019s temporary museum. However, Elgin had bankrupted himself transporting the sculptures to Britain. In 1816 Parliament decided to acquire the collection for the British Museum. Since 1817 the sculptures have always been on display to the public in the British Museum, free of charge.\nThe Parthenon sculptures as they were displayed in 1923 at the British Museum. This is now Room 17. Photo by Donald Macbeth.\nThe Parthenon sculptures in the British Museum are 247 feet (around 75 metres) of the original 524 feet (around 160 metres) of frieze, 15 of the 92 metopes, 17 figures from the two pediments, and various pieces of architecture from the building.\nSculptures from the west pediment of the Parthenon on display in Room 18 in the British Museum.\nAbout half of the surviving sculptures remained in Athens, including extensive remains of the metopes (especially from the east, north and west of the building), the frieze (especially the north and west sides) and the pediments. In the 1970s the Greek government began a programme of restoration of the Acropolis monuments. As part of this work, all the architectural sculptures from the Parthenon have been removed to the Acropolis Museum, and all the Parthenon sculptures are now museum objects.\nMost of the sculptures are roughly equally divided between Athens and London, but important pieces are also held by other major European museum including the\u00a0Louvre and Vatican Museums.\nInspiration for artists\nThe Parthenon sculptures have inspired artists and writers for generations, from John Keats to Henry Moore. Perhaps the most influential of these was the French sculptor Auguste Rodin, who saw in Pheidias a kindred spirit and artistic mentor.\nAuguste Rodin (1840\u20131917), Study of the Parthenon south frieze cavalcade.

Without the belief that the world is orderly, causally complete, and (in principle) explicable in terms of the properties of physical matter and lawful forces, the methods of science would be unreliable. But they are not. One after another, phenomena that previously seemed utterly mysterious \u2013 from the motion of stars to the nature of life \u2013 have succumbed to the explanatory power of science.\nCuriosity and exploration are essential for the survival of mobile organisms. Exploring the environment in order to understand it and to use that knowledge to predict events is clearly important for any animal looking for food or a mate, and trying to avoid being someone else\u2019s dinner. Presumably it is the enormous brain of human beings that propelled us into the state of exaggerated curiosity that distinguishes our species. Perhaps we should have been called Homo curiosus, rather than Homo sapiens: without curiosity, there could be no wisdom.\nI suspect we\u2019ll agree that a lust for understanding underpins both religion and science. But, to my mind, they are epistemologically incompatible. In our quest to comprehend nature (including our own nature), there is no place for ideology, dogma and unjustifiable faith. Nor for appeals to the \u2018super\u2019-natural.\nYours,\nColin\nLion Man from three angles. Stadel Cave, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, 40,000 years old. \u00a9 Ulmer Museum.\nDear Colin,\nI was rather hoping for something that I might be able to disagree with! Love the Homo curiosus idea, and the \u2018lust for understanding\u2019. Well perhaps I can disagree with your assumption at the end that \u2018religion\u2019 is some sort of alternative epistemology for finding out knowledge about the world. You sketch the convenient (Auguste) Comtean picture of science slowly replacing \u2018religion\u2019 as explanation, as it paints the priest and prophet into an ever-vanishing corner of the epistemological room. It\u2019s such a common misunderstanding, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that it is just that. So, I\u2019m not surprised at the hurling around of words like \u2018ideology\u2019, \u2018dogma\u2019 and \u2018unjustified faith\u2019 \u2013 perhaps there is rather a lot to unpick here after all.\nPainted textile (thangka) with the wheel of life. Tibet, 19th century.\nLet\u2019s start with your (and our shared) \u2018belief that the world is orderly\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s true \u2013 continually, miraculously (in the bare sense of the word) it\u2019s faith that turns out to be justified. We don\u2019t know if that will continue of course, but both suspect that it will. Kepler,\u00a0Faraday, Maxwell, Einstein, Hoyle and many other scientists have not unreasonably raised the theological significance of the discovery that mental structure is there in the universe.\nMy tradition of Judeo-Christianity is not a set of rival explanatory \u2018supernatural\u2019 causes for the world, but (among many other things) a story of how humans have come to terms with their relationship to that world (and yes with its Creator). The great medieval scientific enlightenment lit the fuse that led to the events we call the \u2018scientific revolution\u2019 with methods of observation and cognition, and with a driving narrative of purpose and hope, that was explicitly generated by a theological narrative. The early moderns, Francis Bacon, Robert Boyle, Newton himself \u2013 drove experimental science from the same source.\nScience can give helpful evolutionary and anthropological explanations of where curiosity came from, but it cannot give us the story we need to live in now, on why we do science itself, for what end and for whom, why human persons find, as Kant put it, a disjuncture between the \u2018is\u2019 and the \u2018ought\u2019. I am trying to get at what Einstein meant when he said:\nReligion without science is blind; science without religion is lame.\nYours,\nTom\nDear Tom,\nYes, we have plenty to agree on \u2013 especially the explanatory power of science, and its dependence on the regularity and lawfulness of the universe. And I agree that mystical notions might have provided human beings, in the past, with a normative mythology, partly reassuring, partly intimidating, about the role of people on this earth. But the existence of an idea, even if widespread among humans, even if powerful in its influence, doesn\u2019t make it correct.\n\u00c9tienne Delaune (c. 1518\u20131583), Plate 14 from the series The Genesis showing the building of the Tower of Babel. Engraving, 1550\u20131572.\nThere are two themes in your reply that I\u2019m eager to discuss when we meet on 26 January. The first is your suggestion that the Judeo-Christian narrative is not an explanation myth but \u2018a story of how humans have come to terms with their relationship to that world\u2019. Apart from the fact that Genesis 1:1 seems to have been forgotten, I wonder how you can accept fables and legends, bereft of evidence, as anything more than fiction. And if you mean that religious codes have provided people with essential guidance on how to relate to each other and to the natural world, I must remind you that religio-politics (from far right Christian fundamentalism to Jihadist terrorism to Buddhist ethnic cleansing to Zionist Islamophobia) isn\u2019t doing a very good job. Our only chance of coming to terms with each other and the world lies in the genuine understanding of that world and of the nature of human beings that comes from evidence-based scholarship (in the humanities as well as science).\nThe second is your notion that the inspiration for scientists (and even for science itself) was \u2018a driving narrative of purpose and hope\u2019 provided by religion. Human beings certainly have a tendency to see purpose and meaning in the world, as well as an inclination to perceive agency and intention. These cognitive dispositions are efficient ways of identifying the presence and actions of other people, but they can lead to a false model of causation based on intention, and the curious view that life is valuable only if it has some undefined \u2018meaning\u2019. I think that this is the more correct interpretation of your statement that \u2018mental structure is there in the universe\u2019. As for religion inspiring science, you proffer Bacon, Boyle and Newton. But I raise you Bohr, Medawar, Tinbergen, Higgs, Crick, Monod, Kroto, Chadwick, Brenner, Bondi, Pauling, etc. As for Einstein and the enigmatic words that you cite, I submit his own explanation:\nI do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.\nHear, hear.\nYours,\nColin\nDear Colin\nWe have established that very clever and wise scientists can be atheists, and equally can be theists. Very detailed sociological work along these lines has been carried out more recently by sociologists such as Elaine Ecklund at Rice University. But all that does is to give us pause before we take the line that either worldview is obviously right, or obviously wrong. I think that an equally sterile course would be to pivot an argument on the worst excesses of those who distort tradition to violent and poisonous ends (including those of the officially atheist regimes we have seen only since the 20th\u00a0century).\nWilliam Blake (1757\u20131827), an illustration of The Book of Job. Engraving, 1826.\nWe ought to discuss what \u2018accepting fables and legends\u2019 (I have always preferred \u2018myths\u2019) might mean. Since you mention Genesis 1 (forgotten by whom, by the way, and accepted as meaning what?) it might be helpful in the context of the British Museum to recall the many historical modes of reading such texts that are far more sophisticated than our repertoire today: analogical, anagogical, metaphorical, apocalyptical, normative, and so on. I am always saddened by the cultural failure to read the Bible in our age (irrespective of belief), simply because we miss the wealth of ancient evidence for the way humankind has looked for meaning, in just the way you point out. Berlin philosopher Susan Neiman has claimed, for example, that the Book of Job should be considered alongside Plato as a foundation text for western philosophy. In any case it contains some of the most sublime ancient nature poetry I know, and convinces me that the seeds of what we now call \u2018science\u2019 were sown many generations ago.\nI would love it if we could get beyond and behind arguments \u2018for\u2019 and \u2018against\u2019 theistic belief at the public debate \u2013 and unpack the stated purpose on the blurb: \u2018how science is itself at the heart of being human, and can be traced back through art, philosophy and ancient stories, including those in religious traditions\u2019. I think that one can make a case that one reason for the damaging cultural divide between what we term \u2018arts\u2019 and \u2018sciences\u2019 is the loss of the religious and theological glue that once held them together.\nYours,\nTom\nTom and Colin will continue this discussion live at the British Museum on Friday 26 January 2018.

Wearing the armour of a general, he would originally have held a spear in his right hand, now missing, and possibly a shield in his left (also missing).

Here\u2019s a beautifully detailed watercolour drawing of a vase of flowers by French artist Antoine Jules Pelletier. The Romans called the month Aprilis.\nAntoine Jules Pelletier (fl. c. 1848), A vase of flowers on a marble table.

Before July and August were renamed after Roman rulers, they were called Quintilis and Sextilis, meaning fifth and sixth months. How boring!\nThomas Bewick (1753\u20131828), The moon in a design for a Half-Moon Tavern. Wood engraving, c. 1773.\nSo now you know why we call the months what we do. Here\u2019s one last fact \u2013\u00a0the word \u2018month\u2019 itself is related to the moon.

Commissioned by Shankar from the instrument maker Nodu Mullick in Calcutta. Made in 1961.\nA recent very generous gift of a sitar to the Museum has enabled us to dramatically demonstrate this in the newly refurbished Sir Joseph Hotung Gallery of China and South Asia. The new gallery takes a chronological approach, starting with the first tools of near humans from about 1.5 million years ago, and ending with contemporary South Asia \u2013 the latest item is a 2008 installation by the Bangladeshi artist Naeem Mohaieman. Among these last displays is a case demonstrating the remarkable internationalisation of Indian culture \u2013 film, dance and especially music.\nThe sitar now on display in Room 33 is particularly special. It was made for the great musician Ravi Shankar (1920\u20132012) in 1961 by the Calcutta-based instrument maker Nodu Mullick. Mullick made four sitars for Shankar, and we believe this to be the first of the group. The neck and sounding board are made of teak, while the bulbous resonator is a gourd (a second, smaller, removable gourd resonator is at the top of the neck). The metal strings are tensioned across the neck and the belly, and are kept taut by pegs in the neck. The neck is decorated with stained and inlaid bone, and the belly with laid-on patterning in wood of vegetal scrolling. Other examples of Indian musical instruments exist in the Museum\u2019s collection, though none are as beautifully decorated or so connected to a cultural figure of the stature of Pandit Ravi Shankar.\nYou can find out more in this video:\nRavi Shankar spent his whole life presenting the artistic traditions of his own country to the rest of the world. Initially he did this through participation in the dance troupe of his elder brother, Uday Shankar, but in his late teens, he gave up dancing in favour of music and above all, the sitar.\nHe came from a family of Bengali origin though he was born in Benares (now Varanasi) in northern India, in 1920. His elder brother, Uday, was a well-known dancer who both studied and performed in London \u2013 incredibly he worked with Anna Pavlova, their piece de resistance, a pas de deux: Radha-Krishna. Uday is known to have visited the British Museum to study Indian medieval sculpture to enable him to better understand how to develop his new Indian dance. The wonderful gift of the sitar is therefore just the latest chapter in the history of connections between the Shankar family and the Museum.\nThe gift has come from Sukanya Shankar, the widow of Ravi Shankar, their daughter Anoushka Shankar and the Ravi Shankar Foundation. Anoushka is also herself a renowned sitar player, both following in the footsteps of her father but also striking out on her own path of musical expression and discovery.\u00a0The Museum is also most grateful to Nasreen Munni Kabir for her help with this project.\nAnoushka Shankar playing Ravi Shankar\u2019s sitar in the Museum.\nRavi Shankar\u2019s great genius was his openness to other traditions. He was so confidently grounded in his own tradition that he felt unthreatened and completely secure in both presenting it to the world, but also engaging with other traditions in a wonderfully open and collaborative way. This, of course, is most remembered in his teaching of, and collaboration with the Beatles, above all George Harrison. He also worked with jazz and classical musicians, famously with the violinist Yehudi Menuhin. He was an ambassador for transcultural activity of the most profound and spontaneous variety.\nIn this video, Anoushka Shankar performs on her father\u2019s sitar:\nThe gift of the sitar to the Museum enables us to tell both the human story of Ravi Shankar\u2019s life and work, both in the west and in India, but also to place him, and other cultural ambassadors, within the context of the discovery of the cultural achievements of the entire world.

But have you ever thought about why it looks the way it does?\nGrand designs\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning. When you walk into the Museum from Great Russell Street (that\u2019s the Main entrance), most of the building you can see today was designed in 1823 by the architect Sir Robert Smirke (1780\u20131867).\nThe British Museum\u2019s fa\u00e7ade was designed by Sir Robert Smirke.\nSmirke designed the building in a style known as the Greek Revival. He used this popular style because historians and travellers had rediscovered ancient sites from the 1750s onwards. They returned to their home countries, including Britain, with sketchbooks packed full of drawings and measurements of the monuments they saw. The Museum\u2019s building was particularly inspired by ancient Greek temples, the most famous of which is the Parthenon in Athens.\nHere\u2019s a quick introduction to some of the architectural features you can see on the British Museum\u2019s building.\nA portico is like a modern porch, and was usually the entrance to ancient Greek temples, just like in the Museum. It is made up of columns, which support the roof.\nColumns are very important tall structures that support the roof. They come in all shapes and sizes, but ancient Greek ones come in three main types (or orders) called Doric, Ionic and Corinthian. The Roman architect Vitruvius wrote a few stories to explain why they\u2019re called that (but it\u2019s quite likely he just made them up!):\nDoric\nDorus, mythical King of the Peloponnesus, built a temple so great that all temples in the surrounding area copied it. When the Athenians invaded and saw them, they began to build temples in the same style, calling them \u2018Doric\u2019 as they were originally built by the Dorians. The Athenians wanted to make theirs better, so they used the length of a man\u2019s foot and height to get the perfect proportions. The Parthenon\u2019s columns are Doric.\nIonic\nThe Athenians wanted to build a temple to the goddess Artemis. They thought the Doric columns were too masculine, so they measured the foot and height of a woman. The big curling scrolls at the top (volutes) are like curly hair, and flutes (grooves carved into the column) are like folds in Greek clothing. The Museum\u2019s columns are Ionic.\nCorinthian\nVitruvius said this column is based on a tragic story. A young girl from Corinth died and was buried, and her nurse put her things in a basket on top of her tomb. Her tomb rested on the root of an acanthus plant, and when spring came, the stalks and leaves grew up over the basket. An architect spotted it was inspired to create a new capital design.\nDoric, Ionic and Corinthian capital types.\nThe capital is the top section of the column. It is wider than the rest of the column to support the weight of the roof, but is often the most interesting part to look at, as they can be highly decorative.\nThe Museum\u2019s colonnade and columns.\nA colonnade is a long row of columns which sometimes, but don\u2019t always, support a roof. These are usually covered walkways, and are sometimes extensions of the portico. The Museum has 44 columns in the colonnade.\nThe frieze is a long section between the pediment and the columns that is purely for decoration. Usually it has lots of sculptural details. The Museum\u2019s frieze doesn\u2019t have any sculptures though. Here\u2019s one of the friezes in the Museum from the temple of Apollo Epikourios at Bassai. The sculptures on this frieze depict a mythical battle between the Centaurs and Lapiths.\nThe frieze from the Temple of Apollo Epikourios at Bassai, Greece, on display in Room 16.\nThe pediment is a large triangle, usually found on top of temples. The Museum\u2019s pediment was built in the 1850s, designed by Sir Richard Westmacott. The figures in it were supposed to represent \u2018The Progress of Civilisation\u2019 \u2013 now a very old-fashioned idea. If you look closely, on the far left you can see an uneducated man emerging from behind a rock. He learns things like sculpture, music and poetry, thus becoming \u2018civilised\u2019. These subjects are personified \u2013 they are represented by human figures. From left to right, they are Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Science, Geometry, Drama, Music and Poetry.

In this sculpture from a Jain temple in Rajasthan, she holds a palm-leaf manuscript and a rosary in her left hands, and may have held a stringed musical instrument and a lotus flower in her right hands (now broken).

China, 16th century.\nThis box is a fine example of 16th-century inlaid lacquer. This type of pictorial design became increasingly intricate, partly due to the widespread availability of woodblock prints which provided artisans with clear references. The scene depicts a group of scholars, identified by their elaborate robes and caps, and attendants scattered across an architectural setting, enjoying recreational pursuits such as painting, calligraphy and zither playing.\nWenyuan Xin, Project Curator: China and South Asia\nBronze bell\nBronze bo bell. Houma, Shanxi province, China, 600\u2013400 BC.\nBronze bells such as this, with a flat bottom rim and a loop knob (often elaborated in dragon shapes), are called bo in Chinese texts. They were used together with other varieties of bells to form a chime set to produce music essential for court life and rituals. All bells in China were cast with an elliptical section and some of them can produce two notes when struck at the mid-point of the bottom rim or at the bottom corner. This bo bell was made at the Houma foundry in present-day Shanxi province around 600\u2013400 BC. At Houma, patterns on bells and other ritual bronzes were made by using pattern blocks, allowing mass production of objects with complex yet identical surface decorations.\nYi Chen, Curator: Early Chinese Collections\nModern landscape\nYang Yongliang (b. 1980), Phantom Landscape III, leaves 1 and 2.

Roman sources tell us that to intimidate this native Briton and the Iceni tribe of whom she was leader, the order was given that Boudicca should be flogged and her young daughters raped. Originally Rome\u2019s allies, the Iceni formed one of the client kingdoms that signed up to the Roman project in return for protection and trade deals. With flinty greed, Rome then challenged the will of Boudicca\u2019s husband, Prasutagus, who had left half the Iceni land to his two daughters.\nBettany Hughes and the Fenwick Hoard.\nThe heat of Boudicca\u2019s anger was made flesh. We\u2019re told the defiled, humiliated queen\u00a0strategised her rage and persuaded others to join her to try to push Rome out of Britannia. The Fenwick Hoard, recently discovered in Colchester (when the Fenwick building there was being renovated), is packed with tragic treasures \u2013 dates, lentils, mustard seeds, flash-burnt by the fires of those who, along with Boudicca, incinerated the city. St Albans, London and many settlements in between fell too, as Boudicca set about with sword and flame to undermine Roman rule.\nBut there\u2019s an issue with Boudicca\u2019s warrior-woman wonderfulness. We know about this tribal queen mainly from Roman sources. Focusing on her appearance, a century later Cassius Dio described her tawny hair down to her hips, her flashing eyes and strident voice. Boudicca was represented, and thus perceived, as a kind of gorgeous, anti-superhero. Her extra-specialness was promoted as the reason she gave the Romans a run for their money.\nMarble frieze from The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, also known as\u00a0The Amazon Frieze. Ancient Greece, c. 350 BC.\nThe same applies when it comes to the Amazons. Although they have been judged through time to be a quasi-mythical race of warrior women, who only slept with men to acquire warrior offspring \u2013who founded cities, drank fermented mares milk and rode with one breast-bare \u2013 archaeological and historical research now suggests these were real, flesh-and-blood female fighters from the tribes of Scythia and Sarmatia. Given that their central skill was horseback combat, which requires not just muscular strength but strategy and multitasking, the success of these \u2018Amazons\u2019 becomes easier to comprehend. Buried with jewellery including bracelets made of fox teeth, these fighting women have fingers bent by archery and bowed legs from a lifetime of riding, and were sometimes buried in a riding position. New DNA evidence suggests that as many as a third of the warrior graves from 100 BC\u2013AD 500 could belong to women.\nBettany Hughes with an Amazon sword, c. 1000 BC, behind the scenes at Georgia\u2019s National Museum. Image: @bettanyhughes.\nA couple of years back I was lucky enough to get behind the scenes at Georgia\u2019s National Museum. I\u2019d heard that a number of warrior graves containing women, buried with weapons, had recently been identified. And when I say a number, we\u2019re talking 800. The brilliant chief archaeologist led me to the storeroom and pulled out a series of 19th-century wooden drawers. Wrapped in brown tissue paper, inside was one woman\u2019s hand, ring intact, and an almighty sword. Holding that sword I felt to be in two times at once. Imagining the rage or fear of the women who originally wielded such armaments \u2013\u00a0women who would, quite rightly, be outraged to discover that for centuries their real battles had been demoted to the realm of mythology and fantasy.\nThe Queen of the Night relief. Old Babylonian, 19th\u201318th centuries BC.\nRight back in prehistory the first deities of female sexuality were also goddesses of war \u2013\u00a0feisty creatures such as Astarte and Inanna described by their priestess-poets as \u2018riding on fire-red power\u2019, \u2018battle-planners\u2019, \u2018foe-smashers\u2019. As the story of civilisation began the female of the species was not taken lightly. Tracing the hard evidence of warrior women \u2013 real and imagined \u2013 helps us chart attitudes to women through time. Fascinatingly, thanks to the re-examination of bone evidence discovered in the 1960s, it seems mounted women warriors from the Sarmatian Danube might even have ended up fighting within the Roman army, stationed at the Roman fort of Brocavum, Cumbria, near Hadrian\u2019s Wall. These female fighters deserve our attention \u2013 so we can better understand both their world and our own. A good starting point is the timeless speech put into the mouth of one of the Queens of the Amazons, by Quintus of Smyrna in the fourth century AD:\nNot in strength are we inferior to men; the same our eyes, our limbs the same; one common light we see, one air we breathe; nor different is the food we eat\u2026 why then are we denied what is bestowed on men?\nIt is Shylock\u2019s plea a millennium before Shakespeare\u2019s The Merchant of Venice, and one as cogent in the 21st century as it was in antiquity.\nBettany Hughes\u2019 latest book is Istanbul: A Tale of Three Cities, published by Weidenfeld and Nicholson, and her film Venus Uncovered produced by Sandstone Global is available on BBC iPlayer.

Professor Yuri Chistov of Peter the Great\u2019s Kunstkamera Museum in St Petersburg opened this wonderful world to me when he encouraged me to study the human skeletons from the incredible burial ground of Aymyrlyg. Located at the southernmost end of Siberia, near the border with Mongolia, this vast cemetery contained the burials of some 600 people of the Scythian world. The majority were buried within rectangular tombs made from logs \u2013 the log houses of the dead.\nInterior of a log house tomb from Aymyrlyg. Drawn by Libby Mulqueeny, Queen\u2019s University Belfast, and based on an excavation photograph archived in the Photographic Archive of the Institute for the History of Material Culture, St Petersburg.\nAymyrlyg was a community burial ground used by these Iron Age mobile pastoralists over many generations. During the summer they probably spent their time traversing the steppes with their livestock, returning to the valley in which Aymyrlyg lay during the colder months. A clue to this seasonal pattern of movement can be found in the condition of the bodies, some of which had been treated in such a way that suggested processing for temporary storage. The remains of certain people had been reduced to small parcels and in some cases the soft tissues had been removed. These were the bodies of those who had died far from the cemetery during the summer months and required storage before the autumn journey back to the valley where the dead could then be buried at Aymyrlyg.\nThe mummified adult male recovered from Barrow 5. Photo: V Terebenin, State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg.\nWe know the Scythians were skilled at mummification processes from the evidence apparent in the bodies of those buried in the spectacular royal tombs at Pazyryk in the Altai region of southern Siberia. These individuals had been trepanned, disembowelled and, in some cases, had soft tissues removed from various parts of the body. Evidence of coarse stitching is still visible in the mummies.\nCut marks indicative of disarticulation at the right hip of a 25\u201335-year-old man from Aymyrlyg. Photo: Eileen Murphy, Queen\u2019s University Belfast.\nIn Book IV of his Histories, the fifth-century BC writer Herodotus gives the impression that the Scythians were a bloodthirsty bunch who spent much of the time marauding in bands across the steppe lands. Among the Aymyrlyg population there were clearly those who had suffered a violent death, particularly from a lethal battle-axe blow to the skull \u2013 this weapon displays a marked similarity to the modern-day ice pick and was highly efficient in dispensing death.\nSeventh-century BC battle-axe with gold overlay decoration from the \u2018royal\u2019 tomb at Arzhan-2. Photo: V Terebenin, State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg.\nThe man from Barrow 2 at Pazyryk displayed evidence for at least two such blows to his head as well as very early, but indisputable, evidence for scalping. We should not be surprised at all by this finding. Herodotus tells us, with what might be detected as a certain amount of glee, that the Scythians scalped their enemies and hung the scalps on their horse harnesses as a symbol of battle prowess.\nThe head of the man from Barrow 2 at Pazyryk. Two battle-axe holes are evident and the scalp has been cut off from the top of the forehead to the back of the neck. Photo: Yuri Chistov, Kunstkamera Museum, St Petersburg.\nWhile most of those who had died violently were adult males, some females and teenagers at Aymyrlyg also displayed weapon injuries. The suggestion of warrior women should again be of no surprise to us since Herodotus described in detail the Amazons \u2013 a tribe of female steppe warriors. Indeed, numerous burials of women accompanied by weapons have been discovered across the Eurasian steppe lands.\nBattle-axe injuries in the skull of a 35\u201345-year-old man from Aymyrlyg. No evidence for healing was visible and it is probable the man died as a result of these blows. Photo: Eileen Murphy, Queen\u2019s University Belfast.\nWhile the evidence for violent death is certainly compelling, it needs to be appreciated that relatively few people buried at Aymyrlyg had died in this manner \u2013 around 3% of the adults. In many ways it was even more interesting for me to find potential evidence of care and community support within the burial ground that somehow didn\u2019t quite fit with the stereotypical image we have of the Scythians. Certain individuals displayed serious physical impairments or evidence of chronic disease that would have made it difficult for them to have fully embraced daily tasks necessary for survival. Two women displayed evidence for the same congenital hip defect that would have rendered their affected legs practically unusable. In both cases the affected limbs had wasted away through lack of use and the women would have needed supports to help with their mobility. Another woman had evidence of a long-standing substantial soft-tissue growth in one of her eye sockets. Undoubtedly her sight would have been affected and she may also have suffered from other impairments invisible to us. The lives of these three women would no doubt have been particularly challenging.\nNotably enlarged left eye socket in a 17\u201325-year-old woman from Aymyrlyg that is suggestive of the presence of a soft-tissue tumour that may have been associated with the condition neurofibromatosis.

This unparalleled repository of Maya writing and iconography is the legacy of Alfred Percival Maudslay, a Victorian \u2018explorer\u2019 whose life and work contributed immeasurably to the study of the ancient Maya from Central America.\nAlfred Percival Maudslay sitting on a mule in a jungle clearing. Photograph taken in Quirigu\u00e1, Guatemala, 1890.\nAlfred Maudslay was born in 1850 to a family of wealthy engineers. After graduating from Cambridge, he travelled to the Caribbean and Central America, stopping briefly in Guatemala in 1872. A chance encounter on his return journey afforded Maudslay the opportunity of entering the Colonial Service. This early career took him first to Queensland, Australia, then to Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. In 1880 he once again crossed the Atlantic to Central America, but whether this was as an idle traveller or with a specific archaeological purpose remains unclear.\nMaudslay would have been familiar with the work of the American writer John Lloyd Stephens and his travel companion, the English artist Frederick Catherwood. Their own travels through the Maya area had resulted in two internationally successful volumes, containing rich and evocative illustrations of ruined ancient Maya cities, such as Cop\u00e1n, Palenque and Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1.\nStela H, Cop\u00e1n, Honduras. Left: Illustration by Frederick Catherwood (1844). Image courtesy of Maya Portrait Project. Right: Cast on display at the British Museum.\nEn route to Cop\u00e1n, whose monumental carved stelae had already been made famous by Catherwood\u2019s illustrations, Maudslay spent a few days at the site Quirigu\u00e1, in Guatemala. Forty years before, Catherwood had been the first European to record the site, and in the intervening years few travellers ventured to it. It became Maudslay\u2019s privilege to \u2018unveil\u2019 Quirigu\u00e1\u2019s moss-covered ancient monuments and their mysterious inscriptions, now on UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage list. He would return to Quirigu\u00e1 a further three times. Ten years after his first visit, Maudslay wrote of the experience:\nIt was the unexpected magnificence of the monuments which that day came into view that led me to devote so many years to securing copies of them, which, preserved in the museums of Europe and America, are likely to survive the originals.\nLeft: Stela E, Quirigu\u00e1, Guatemala. Photo by A P Maudslay. Right: 3D model of the stela.\nHe was driven by the conviction, not widely shared at the time, that the mysterious hieroglyphic writing system of the Maya would one day be deciphered and understood. Over the course of a decade, and multiple trips to the Maya area, Maudslay used the most up-to-date technologies available to him \u2013\u00a0dry plate photography and paper and plaster moulding techniques \u2013 to record the sculptures he encountered. The British Museum was eventually the fortunate recipient of this vast archive.\nMaudslay\u2019s glass plate negative boxes.\nOver 800 glass plate negatives are still stored at the Museum in their original wooden boxes, especially created by Maudslay to protect them on their journey through the jungle.\nAssistant Collections Manager Jonny Mortemore scanning a glass plate negative.\nThe partnership with Google Arts and Culture has made it possible to scan these exceptional images at ultra-high resolution, allowing for almost unlimited zoom and the consequent discovery of myriad overlooked details.

Photo by A P Maudslay. The enlarged section shows unidentified assistant, porter and previously undocumented Jaguar graffiti.\nDespite the magnificence of his photographs, it is perhaps his 500 casts of dozens of monuments that are most valued by scholars. In 1882, Maudslay learnt the art of paper moulding, a technique which had been developed only twenty years earlier as an easy, cheap and lightweight solution for capturing and reproducing carvings on the fa\u00e7ades of archaeological monuments in remote areas of the world.\nA mould was created by the application of moist paper (a bit like papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9) to a low-relief inscription or carving. Once dry, the mould was removed, resulting in a negative impression from which a positive could be cast in plaster back in England. For Maudslay, this was an ideal solution for capturing images of the glyphs, the decipherment of which so drove him.\nLeft: Epigrapher Christophe Helmke studying one of Maudslay\u2019s casts in British Museum storage. Right: researchers from Central Saint Martins examining the paper moulds with Project Curator Kate Jarvis.\nSome monuments were too deeply and intricately carved for paper moulding to be practical. Plaster piece-moulding, for undercut or in-the-round sculptures, was a highly skilled undertaking. To achieve a complete inventory of monuments from the sites he visited, Maudslay employed a master plaster modeller, Lorenzo Giuntini, who moulded and cast monuments such as Zoomorph P at Quirigu\u00e1 and Stelae A and H at Cop\u00e1n.\nZoomorph P at Quirigua, Guatemala, 1883.\nZoomorph P alone required two tons of plaster of Paris to be shipped from England and carried to the site by mule.\nLorenzo Giuntini and assistants creating a plaster mould of Zoomorph P at Quirigua, Guatemala, 1883.\nThe two techniques produced three-dimensional replicas that were, and still are, the ultimate resource for epigraphers (scholars studying inscriptions). While drawings are prone to artistic interpretation and subjectivity, and photographs are affected by lighting conditions which can distort detail, casts are near-perfect duplicates of the originals as they were when Maudslay visited them.\nThe intervening 150 years have immeasurably increased the scholarly value of these casts. As Maudslay anticipated, many of the original monuments from which they were taken have been looted, destroyed, or left exposed to weathering and acid rain. Often, details that are so clearly visible on the casts have vanished from the originals, and in a few cases, Maudslay\u2019s casts are the only surviving record of particular monuments or inscriptions. They may not be the \u2018real\u2019 thing, but it is imperative that we protect the casts and the information they contain. It is a case of recording the record.\nStone Conservator Amy Drago working on a cast of Quirigu\u00e1\u2019s Zoomorph B.\nThe Google Maya Project was born out of both fortune and circumstance. The casts are scheduled to be transferred from their current location in storage in West London. Practical considerations around the continued accessibility of this valuable resource led to a proposal to 3D scan all of the casts and make them digitally accessible to scholars and a broader public. Support from Google Arts and Culture saw our ambitions grow in scope to include state-of-the-art digitisation of Maudslay\u2019s glass plate photographs and field journals, Street View tours and VR expeditions. A bespoke Google Arts and Culture platform now hosts themed exhibits and content,\u00a0primarily relating to Guatemala, which has been the focus of the project in its first year.\nProject Curator Claudia Zehrt working on a 3D scan.\nMaya archaeologist Claudia Zehrt joined the Americas team as the lead Google Maya Project Curator to direct and manage the project\u2019s output.

Its aim is to train archaeologists from across the whole of Iraq in cultural heritage management and practical fieldwork skills.\nThe training consists of two months based in London at the British Museum, followed by two months of hands-on training on site in Iraq. This practical training takes place at two field projects \u2013\u00a0in the south of Iraq at the site of Tello, and in the north at the Darband-i Rania. This short film gives a brief introduction to some of the Scheme\u2019s work so far:\nTello\u00a0\u2013 ancient Girsu\nTello, the modern Arabic name of the ancient Sumerian city of Girsu, is one of the earliest known cities of the world. It is a mega-site, with a similar topographical layout to the recently liberated Assyrian capitals of northern Iraq \u2013\u00a0Nimrud and Nineveh. During the 3rd millennium BC Girsu was considered the sanctuary of the Sumerian heroic god Ningirsu.\nThe site was first and extensively investigated between 1877 and 1933. This brought to light some of the most important monuments of Sumerian art and architecture, including the statuary of the ruler Gudea and the Bridge of Girsu \u2013\u00a0the oldest bridge to be discovered in the world. Tello is therefore ideal for delivering the training for the Iraqi archaeologists.\nExcavations in the autumn of 2016 and spring and autumn of 2017 were carried out as part of the training of the archaeologists in the heart of the sacred district of Girsu, at Tell A, known as the Mound of the Palace. Under the guidance of Lead Archaeologist Sebastien Rey, British Museum archaeologists and the Iraqi trainees used declassified 1960s satellite images and modern drones to create digital elevation models of the whole temple site. Using these as a guide to this battered landscape, the archaeologists were able to unearth extensive mudbrick walls \u2013 some ornamented with pilasters and inscribed magical cones \u2013 belonging to the Ningirsu temple. This 4,000-year-old temple dedicated to the storm god was considered as one of the most important sacred places of Mesopotamia, praised for its magnificence in many contemporary literary compositions.\nThe temple of the Sumerian storm god Ningirsu at Tello.\nInscribed cones are among the most iconic objects of ancient Mesopotamia and museums across the world hold hundreds of them in their collections. They are votive artefacts made in clay bearing dedicatory texts from Mesopotamian rulers to the gods of the Sumerians. More than 15 cones were found in the temple to the mighty god Ningirsu. This is a very important discovery, as until now, none has been found in their original context. This meant\u00a0the archaeologists had the opportunity to examine them in situ for the first time. Research has shown they were placed to follow a particular pattern. The team is in the process of deciphering this pattern which may unlock some of the mysteries surrounding ancient religious practices.\nExcavating magical cones from the walls of the temple.\nAmong the other unique finds was a foundation box below one of the principal gates of the complex. It contained a white ritual stone tablet belonging to the ruler Gudea. Excavations under the temple also led to the discovery of two superimposed monumental platforms. The oldest one could be dated to the beginning of the third millennium and predates the previous earliest known Mesopotamian stepped-terrace by a few hundred years.\nThe tablet and other important finds will be displayed in the Iraq Museum in Baghdad and a column base from the Ningirsu temple will be displayed in the in the local museum of Nassiriya, the closest to the site of Tello.\nDarband-i Rania\nThe Darband-i Rania, located 100km from the Kurdish capital of Erbil and 100km north of Sulaimaniya, is a pass at the western edge of the Zagros mountains on a historic route from Mesopotamia to Iran. It is the route through which Alexander the Great passed in 331 BC in pursuit of the Persian king Darius III. Earlier, in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, it was at the eastern edge of the Assyrian empire.\nThe principal work of the Iraq Scheme has been at Qalatga Darband, a site overlooking the Lower Zab river at the western end of the pass. The site was originally discovered from the analysis of declassified spy satellite imagery from the 1960s. One of the first achievements of the Iraq Scheme has been to map the large number of carved limestone blocks which lie scattered across the site and indicate the presence of substantial remains. New analysis of imagery captured by drone survey shows that numerous other major buildings also lie buried at the site.\nAn example of the imagery captured by the drone survey.\nExcavations have been conducted at Qalatga Darband in multiple areas under the guidance of Lead Archaeologist John MacGinnis. The presence of a large fortified structure at the north end of the site has been confirmed, while numerous stone presses hint at facilities for wine production. The strong Hellenistic influence is evident in two different buildings which are built in the Greco-Roman architectural tradition, particularly the use of terracotta roof tiles.\nInvestigation of the huge stone mound at the southern end of the site is uncovering remains of a monumental building which, based on the presence of the smashed remains of Hellenistic statuary, would appear to be a temple for the worship of Greco-Roman deities. These include a seated female figure, possibly the queen of the underworld Persephone, and a half life-size nude male figure, perhaps the Greek god of beauty and desire Adonis.\nHalf life-size nude male figure, perhaps the Greek god of beauty and desire Adonis, found during one of the digs.\nFrom site to museum\nThe significant finds being made across both sites by the British Museum\u2019s Iraq Scheme pass into the care of museums in Iraq. At Tello, the magical cones, a fragment of a marble foundation tablet of the Sumerian ruler Ur-Bau and other important finds will be displayed in the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, and a column base from the temple will be displayed in the local museum to Tello at Nassiriya. The work of the Darband-i Rania Archaeological Project is adding a new chapter to the history of Iraqi Kurdistan, a region which in archaeological terms has previously been almost completely unexplored. The discovery of a fort dating to the time of the Assyrian period will generate information on a corner of the empire which is currently virtually unknown.\nThese new discoveries are proving that there is still much more to learn from Iraq\u2019s many heritage sites. The vital skills that the trainees are learning are saving the country\u2019s unique historic archaeology for the future.\nYou can find out more about the Scheme on the Museum\u2019s website."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/under-the-microscope-the-oxus-treasure-and-scythian-gold/", "category": "Curator's corner", "title": "Under the microscope: the Oxus treasure and Scythian gold", "author": "Aude Mongiatti, Scientist", "timestamp": "2017-11-20 00:00:00", "text": "As part of the research supporting the BP exhibition\u00a0Scythians: warriors of ancient Siberia, I studied eight remarkable gold objects from the Oxus treasure. This treasure consists of about 180 gold and silver objects dated from c. 500\u2013300 BC. Many objects in the Oxus treasure are of the so-called Achaemenid Court style (the ruling dynasty in Persia c. 550\u2013330 BC), but a few are associated with the Scythian-style art of western Siberia. They include a pair of bracelets with terminals in the shape of winged beasts with long snouts, a finger ring with a winged lion, an aigrette in the shape of a lion-griffin, a possible bow-case attachment with a bird\u2019s head and three roundels. The roundels depict a demon\u2019s face, a lion\u2019s face and boars and ibex heads. I also investigated a related gold clothing appliqu\u00e9 depicting two archers, which was found in the 19th century in a Scythian burial mound in the northern Black Sea region.\nBackscattered electron images of two archers back to back on a gold appliqu\u00e9.\nUsing non-invasive scientific techniques \u2013 mainly optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \u2013 I captured images at low and high magnifications. This enabled me to identify and record physical features, tool marks and surface textures, which are characteristic of the techniques used by goldsmiths to manufacture and decorate objects. Optical microscopy allows overall observation of the construction methods and decoration of the gold, while the SEM enables more detailed investigation using two types of black and white images: secondary electron images (SE) and backscattered electron images (BSE). SE images give a general view of the surface of an object while in BSE images, subtle differences in surface topography (e.g. tool marks) and composition are accentuated. This is because the contrast in a BSE image is based on the difference between densities: the heavier an element, the brighter it appears on the image. The SEM is also equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, which identifies the chemical composition of alloys.\nA gold finger ring and a BSE image of a feline head on the finger ring.\nA BSE image of chasing and punching designs on a gold finger ring.\nThe objects were probably made by different craftsmen and are not necessarily even from the same area, although they are all broadly dated to c. 500\u2013300 BC. From our research, we found that the goldsmiths worked gold sheets and wires by hand to create seven of the nine objects studied. The sheets were hammered into the desired shapes and thicknesses from small cast ingots. Further work on the front and the back created the various 3D designs from the flat sheet. The goldsmiths had to go through cycles of hammering and annealing in order to achieve the desired deformation of the metal. Annealing the metal releases the internal stress produced by hammering: the metal sheet was heated to several hundred degrees in order to soften it and allow further deformation and shaping without cracking. Solid wires, such as the tail of the lion-griffin aigrette and the attachment loops on the back of the roundels, were also hammered into a circular section from a small square ingot. The wire tail of the aigrette is a nice example of the choices made by the goldsmith\u00a0\u2013 the leaf-like terminal is shaped directly from the wire itself rather than as a separate piece attached by soldering.\nThe goldsmiths could use a variety of techniques and tools to deform the gold sheet by hand: they could work the gold sheet into relief from the back (a technique called repouss\u00e9) or from the front (a technique called chasing). Both techniques are often combined on one object and most gold objects studied here nicely illustrate this. Chasing is also applied for the decoration by gently hammering blunt-edged punches of various shapes along the gold surface. The punches move and push the metal in order to trace outlines and produce decorative patterns. Evidence of \u2018punching\u2019 is also frequently seen on these Scythian-style objects, to produce smaller decorative embellishments. A specially shaped punch was impressed directly into the front of the metal sheet in order to produce a single design, which was often repeated. The most common examples of punched motifs are lines of dots, and these occur on the finger ring and lion-griffin aigrette. All of these hand-working techniques were widely known and used by goldsmiths in c. 500 BC.\nA gold roundel with a lion face and a BSE image of chasing and punching designs on the roundel.\nThe two exceptions are the matching solid gold bracelets: they were created using a technique known as lost wax casting. This involves making a wax model with all the necessary details, including the high relief features of the eyes, ears, deep grooves and inlay cells. The wax model is then encased in clay, creating a mould which is the exact negative of the original wax model. Then the mould is heated in order to harden the clay and allow the wax to melt out. The mould is then inverted and the molten gold alloy is poured into it. After the metal has cooled, the mould is broken, revealing the cast object. The goldsmith would then most likely further accentuate the outlines and give finer definition to the designs by chasing and punching the metal directly.\nA solid gold bracelet made by lost wax casting and a BSE image showing a detail of the bracelet.\nA BSE image of the designs and decoration on a solid gold bracelet.\nThis group of objects shows a wide range of alloy compositions, from high-purity gold to high-silver electrum \u2013 a naturally occurring gold-silver alloy. The copper content varies from naturally occurring levels in unrefined gold to alloys made with silver-containing gold. Copper makes gold harder and stronger and therefore easier to work and shape. Ancient gold sources exploited from early times are generally gold particles deposited by water movement and found in river beds\u00a0\u2013 this is called alluvial gold. These native gold particles are not pure gold, and usually include a proportion of silver, which is the case for most of the objects analysed here.\u00a0Another feature of native alluvial gold deposits is the presence of tiny, hard Platinum Group Elements (PGE) inclusions, which have been seen on the surfaces of the objects studied.\nThe wide variety of techniques used to make these objects was commonly in use in the first millennium BC. From the earlier scientific research I carried out on the Oxus Treasure, we know that chasing, punching and repouss\u00e9 were the main techniques used to produce gold objects of Achaemenid style. It appears from the present study that the type of objects investigated were manufactured using the same methods, despite being of different style. Does this then mean that an Achaemenid goldsmith created objects in a Scythian style or that Scythian goldsmiths used the same techniques for similar types of objects? We may never know but it is only by continually asking questions and testing them with scientific research like this that we can better understand the development of ancient crafts.\nThe BP exhibition\u00a0Scythians: warriors of ancient Siberia\u00a0is on at the British Museum from 14 September 2017 to 14 January 2018.\nSupported by BP."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/10-things-you-might-not-have-known-about-rodin/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "10 things you might not have known about Rodin", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2017-11-17 00:00:00", "text": "Auguste Rodin (1840\u20131917) is perhaps the most famous sculptor of the modern era. The popularity of The Kiss and the universality of The Thinker alone make him globally renowned. But here are a few facts about this radical sculptor who set a new direction for art with his work.\n1. His most famous sculptures didn\u2019t start out as individual pieces\nThe Kiss and The Thinker\u00a0are among Rodin\u2019s most famous works, but they were originally small figures created to sit on monumental gates, which had been commissioned for the entrance to a new decorative arts museum in Paris.\nThe Gates of Hell. Plaster, 1900. Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay. Image \u00a9 agence photographique du Mus\u00e9e Rodin. Photo: Jerome Manoukian.\nThe museum was never built but Rodin continued to work on The Gates of Hell for years. The sculptures which sat on it were used as the basis for several further works of art by the artist.\n2. The Kiss represented the doomed lovers from Dante\u2019s Inferno\nAlthough the sculpture is often thought of today in romantic terms, it didn\u2019t start out that way. In the epic poem\u00a0Divine Comedy, Dante meets the lovers Paolo and Francesca in his travels around hell. They had been murdered by Francesca\u2019s husband (Paolo\u2019s brother) after he discovered the lovers together. The sculpture sees them at the moment just before death, lost in reckless passion.\nLeft:\u00a0The Kiss. Plaster, 1888\u20131898. \u00a9 Mus\u00e9e Rodin. Photo: Adam Rzepka. Right: The Thinker. Plaster, 1881\u20131882. \u00a9 Mus\u00e9e Rodin. Photo: Herve Lewandowski.\n3. The Thinker\u00a0has been known by many different names\nThis famous figure from\u00a0The Gates of Hell\u00a0initially represented Minos, judge of the damned in the Divine Comedy, and was later supposed to represent the poet Dante. It was given the name The Thinker not by the artist, but by foundry workers, who thought it looked similar to a statue of Lorenzo de Medici by Michelangelo nicknamed Il Penseroso (The Thinker).\n4. Rodin never carved in marble\nHe sometimes posed for the camera with hammer and chisel in hand, but his practice was to model in clay for others to carve in marble or cast into bronze.\nPortrait of Rodin. \u00a9\u00a0Mus\u00e9e Rodin. Photo: Jean de Calan.\n5. He had many lovers\nRodin\u2019s personal charm and fame attracted many female admirers. Among them were talented artists, dancers and actresses.\nIn 1883, Rodin\u00a0met the 18-year-old Camille Claudel. The two formed a passionate but stormy relationship. Claudel was the model for many of Rodin\u2019s figures but she was also a talented sculptor in her own right and the two artists influenced each other greatly. Claudel worked for many years in Rodin\u2019s studio and assisted him with his commissions. She later accused Rodin of stealing her ideas and even of plotting to kill her. She also destroyed much of her own work at this time. Thought at the time to be suffering from mental illness, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital where she spent the rest of her life.\nCamille Claudel and her friend Jessie Lipscombe sculpting in the studio on 117 rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, Paris, 1887. Photo: William Elborne. \u00a9 Mus\u00e9e Rodin. Photo: Jean de Calan.\nLater, in 1904, the Welsh artist Gwen John began to model for Rodin when she was 28 years old, and became his lover. Their liaison lasted ten years, but her passion was overwhelming \u2013 she wrote over a thousand letters to him \u2013 and he had to distance himself from her.\nThroughout his life and other loves, he had a long relationship with seamstress Rose Beuret beginning in 1864, and they had a child together. He married her two weeks before her death in February 1917. He died later that year.\n6. He drew inspiration from ancient Greek art\nRodin had a collection of over 6,000 antiquities and in 1900 he built a museum at Meudon to house his growing collection. At night, by lamplight, he would show visitors the subtle modelling of the carved marble.\nRodin\u2019s collection of antiquities at Meudon. \u00a9 Mus\u00e9e Rodin. Photo: Jean de Calan.\nIn summer, Rodin brought Greek sculptures into the garden and placed them on funerary altars. He said:\nI love the sculptures of ancient Greece. They have been and remain my masters.\n7. Rodin loved the British Museum!\nAs he was so inspired by the art of antiquity, perhaps this is unsurprising. In 1881, aged 41, Rodin came to London and made the first of many visits to the British Museum.\nIt was a time when the Parthenon sculptures were at the height of their fame.\u00a0Although Rodin had already studied the sculptures from books, plaster casts and some originals in the Louvre, his encounter with them in the British Museum had a profound effect and influenced a number of his works.\nThe Parthenon sculptures as they were displayed in the British Museum at the time Rodin would have seen them, c. 1890.\nHe returned to them again and again. He would lop off the heads and limbs from his own sculptures in order to make them more like the archaeological ruins of the past, and in the process created a new genre of art \u2013 the headless, armless torso.\n8. Rodin\u2019s talent wasn\u2019t instantly recognised\nHe failed to get into the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts school in Paris three times.\u00a0Instead he attended the Petite \u00c9cole with its focus on decorative arts. He worked for several years for the prominent sculptor Albert Ernest Carrier-Belleuse where he learnt skills necessary for running a large studio. It was not until Rodin was 40 that he received his first major commission \u2013 The Gates of Hell.\n9. His works often caused controversy\nHis sculpture\u00a0The Age of Bronze\u00a0was so lifelike that he was accused of having cast the work directly from a living model. He made his next sculptures deliberately larger than life to avoid these accusations again.\nThe Age of Bronze.\u00a0Bronze, first exhibited 1877.

It later entered the Tate collection.\n10. Today, he is regarded as a great artist, but at the time he was seen as a radical\nRodin\u2019s plaster sculpture\u00a0The Man with the Broken Nose (1863\u20131864) broke one freezing night in his studio leaving a hole at the back of the head. Overnight it seemed to have aged 2,000 years to become an archaeological fragment. Embracing this accident he decided to enter this \u2018mask\u2019 at the 1865 Salon.\nRodin\u2019s The Man with a Broken Nose. Bronze, modelled 1863\u20131864, cast 1925. \u00a9 Philadelphia Museum of Art.\nIt was too radical for its time. It was considered incomplete and the Salon refused to show it.\nHowever, according to Rodin himself:\nThat mask determined all my future work; it\u2019s the first modelled piece I did. Ever since, I\u2019ve tried to see my works from all possible points of view and to draw them in every one of their aspects. That mask has been on my mind in every thing I have done.\nRodin\u2019s anticipation of developments in art meant that he led rather than followed trends. His work set the scene for 20th-century Modernism and today he remains one of the world\u2019s most famous sculptors.\nSee how Rodin was inspired by antiquity in the special exhibition\u00a0Rodin and the art of ancient Greece from 26 April to 29 July 2018.\nSponsored by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nIn collaboration with Mus\u00e9e\u00a0Rodin, Paris."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/india-and-the-world/", "category": "News", "title": "India and the world", "author": "JD Hill, Research Manager", "timestamp": "2017-11-10 00:00:00", "text": "Today, staff from the British Museum are in Mumbai for the opening of a new exhibition called\u00a0India and the world.

Since then, a team from India and the UK, including me and my co-curator Naman Ahuja, have worked together to agree the storyline, choose the right objects and make the exhibition happen. The creative process has involved meetings in three different continents, telephone calls, online meetings and many emails \u2013 it is a complex operation that only happens when there are skilled people on both sides.\nThe exhibition does not pretend to offer an exhaustive history of India or the world. Instead, we have chosen nine different stories, each of which looks at an aspect of India\u2019s past in comparison or connection with other parts of the world. These are stories told through objects. Choosing the right objects and the right stories has been one of the hardest parts of the project. For the Indian half of each story, objects have been lent from museums and collections across India, bringing together Indian objects never seen together before. The other half of each story is told through objects from across the world but now in just one museum in London.\nThe Buddha, flanked by the Bodhisattvas Vajrapani and Padmapani.

As the exhibition was planned to help celebrate 70 years of India\u2019s independence, it is fitting that we show a copy of the Constitution of the Republic of India, a beautiful and powerful object in its own right.\nOther objects range from a humble brick from one of the world\u2019s first cities to paintings, ancient inscriptions, and even a thousand-year-old cooking pot. Visitors will be welcomed into the exhibition by one of the most iconic statues from the ancient Greek and Roman world \u2013\u00a0the discus-thrower (discobolus) from the British Museum\u2019s collection, which will be in conversation with Indian stone sculpture.\nThe Townley Discobolus (discus-thrower).

They back onto Regent\u2019s Canal where vestiges of their industrial past can still be found \u2013 large wooden doors open out into the air, from the first to the fourth floor above the canal. Behind them great iron engines linked to pulleys are suspended in time from the ceilings. An oversized lift shaft abuts the side of one building, and beside it is a large, olive green, steel shutter, big enough to fit a lorry through.\nSome of the storage of African objects at Franks House.\nThis is Franks House (I and II), and since the 1970s it has been home to a large part of the collection of the Department of Africa, Oceania and the Americas (formerly part of the Department of Ethnography). Inside the store rooms, row upon row of wooden boxes containing 200,000 objects wait patiently upon steel shelves. It will not be long before each box is opened, the objects assessed and moved to the British Museum site in Bloomsbury. These objects are part of one of the largest museum storage moves project ever undertaken.\nThe British Museum\u2019s World Conservation and Exhibition Centre (WCEC) has been designed to provide a safe and accessible space with closely controlled environments suitable for storage of organic materials. The main goal of the WCEC Storage Moves project is to transport the ethnographic collections of a number of Museum curatorial departments from their existing stores to the WCEC by 2021.\nCross-section of the World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre at the British Museum.\nThroughout the process, the Storage and Moves team work with the collections management, conservation and curatorial departments to care for the objects, while also working with facilities management colleagues to build and maintain the new store and its specialist storage furniture. The project has a specialist team dedicated to the demands of the move. The curators work closely with Collections and Assistant Collections Managers to audit the objects and prepare them for the move. There are 15 Assistant Storage Managers who carry out the work of unpacking, inventory updating, repacking, transporting, and installing the objects. They are supported by four Conservators who treat the objects\u2019 immediate problems and take on larger groups of objects which require more specialised work. They are all overseen by two Storage Project Officers and a Senior Conservator, while the overall project is managed by the Collections Project Manager. This team brings together a wealth of experience in object care from the Royal Armouries to the Natural History Museum, and more. The project has allowed many graduates to enter the heritage sector as well as several groups of volunteers, some of whom have since joined the team as employees.\nWarrior\u2019s headdress made of mud, ostrich feathers, metal and human hair. Uganda.\nThe team is currently processing the 50,000 or so objects from Africa that need to be moved. The special feature of this group of objects is the large amount of organic material, from skins and feathers to plant fibres and wooden objects which are sensitive to fluctuations in temperature and humidity. During their historic storage in the Museum they have been subjected to various anti-pest treatments and, as a result, they can be hazardous or require a range of specialist treatments before being stored again.\nCondition checking and moving objects to the new storage facilities.\nThe process of moving objects from their old stores to the new involves a number of stages. First, all objects are audited, condition checked, measured, and photographed for the Museum\u2019s collection online. This digitally accessible record ensures that essential information about each object is quickly available to both the public and Museum staff. Then, conservators carry out treatment on objects, from cleaning to stabilising the structure of vulnerable objects. Next, all objects are packed into boxes and put through one of three treatments: freezing, anoxia or quarantine. This ensures that the threat of pest issues is completely removed.\nThe final stage is transporting the objects to the WCEC where they are unpacked and placed in their permanent location. The team create bespoke, specially designed supports for fragile or unstable objects. Each object is given a new location code, which is entered on the collection online to ensure any object can be easily found just as they could be in their old location.\nA drawer of African objects in the new storage setting.\nEvery day, more and more of the collection is moved into its brand new home in Bloomsbury. Already, the objects are benefiting from the new storage facilities and the attentions of the team. Over the next few years, the Storage Moves project will continue to help the Museum care and conserve the collection so that it can be enjoyed and understood by our worldwide public for generations to come.\nThe WCEC Storage Moves project is generously supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/displaying-the-bahai-faith-the-pen-is-mightier-than-the-sword/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Displaying the Baha\u2019i Faith: the pen is mightier than the sword", "author": "Hilary Freeman, UK National Baha\u2019i Archives", "timestamp": "2017-11-03 00:00:00", "text": "There\u2019s a famous saying that \u2018the pen is mightier than the sword\u2019. In other words, ideas have a greater impact, when written down and read, than when they\u2019re spread by force.\nThose words were coined by the English author Edward Bulwer-Lytton in 1839. He was an exact contemporary of the Persian nobleman Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, Prophet-Founder of the Baha\u2019i Faith, the bicentenary of whose birth is currently being celebrated around the world.\nThe importance of the written word for Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h was established in the earliest moments of his religion. During his first spiritual revelation, he heard these words, \u2018Verily, We shall render Thee victorious by Thyself and by Thy Pen.\u2019 This was to be a message of peace offered, as a gift to people, only through words and the positive acts of those who believed them.\nHere is one of the original pens used by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h.\nReed pen of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h. \u00a9 Baha\u2019i International Community.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine today, when we have the ability literally at our fingertips to share ideas in an instant across the planet, that it was through pens such as this that Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h set out his vision for one, united human race, in more than 100 volumes of writings. Despite the limitations of the technology, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s teachings spread, giving rise to a community that now numbers in the millions, established in virtually every country on the planet.\nThe power of the \u2018Word\u2019 has been central to all the world\u2019s great faiths. It has inspired human beings to discover their noblest qualities and create new patterns of life, giving rise to great civilisations. In the case of older religions, it was the spoken sayings of their founders that were heard and passed down by others, captured in texts that have become sacred scripture. For Muslims, the Qur\u2019an was verbally revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. The revelation that Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h received, for some 40 years, was immediately written down, authenticated by him, and shared far and wide. For all of that time, because of his teachings, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h endured torture, imprisonment and a series of exiles from his homeland.\nRevelation writing\nEyewitnesses left accounts of the extraordinary manner by which Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s writings came into being. Firstly, his secretary, M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u00c1q\u00e1 J\u00e1n, would have ready a number of reed pens \u2013 also on display in the bicentenary display \u2013 and stacks of large sheets of paper.\nReed pens of M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u00c1q\u00e1 J\u00e1n. \u00a9 Baha\u2019i International Community.\nThe verses would then seem to flow from Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, who spoke rapidly or chanted them aloud. Such was the speed with which his verses had to be captured on the paper that they were only readable by the scribe himself. Seeing this page of \u2018revelation writing\u2019 by M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u00c1q\u00e1 J\u00e1n, it looks almost like a sketch by a 20th-century Abstract Expressionist artist. But these are Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s words, hurriedly captured by his scribe.\nRevelation writing of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s Tajalliy\u00e1t, by M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u00c1q\u00e1 J\u00e1n. \u00a9 Baha\u2019i International Community.\nLater, M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u00c1q\u00e1 J\u00e1n would copy out his marks in legible handwriting. Sometimes he could not even read his own writing and he had to ask Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h to help him decipher what was dictated. Then Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h would give his seal of approval to the clean copy.\nOther followers would then take this version, and write it out again, sometimes bind the verses into books like this one, so they could be transported and shared with people throughout the Middle East, and even as far afield as India, Burma (Myanmar) or China.\nA version of Tajalliy\u00e1t, handwritten by Mulla Zaynu\u2019l-Abidin of Najaf-Abad. \u00a9 Baha\u2019i International Community.\nThe Hidden Words\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h himself was also a skilled calligrapher, often transcribing his writings in his own beautiful handwriting that was later illuminated on the page.\nVerses from The Hidden Words by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, in his own handwriting. \u00a9 Baha\u2019i International Community.\nTwo beautiful examples are also on display of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s best-known and well-loved collection of writings, The Hidden Words, verses that present the ethical heart of his message and distil the spiritual guidance of all religions of the past. Among the principles conveyed in this example is the teaching of the oneness and the equality of the human race: \u2018O Children of Men!\u2019 he writes, \u2018Know ye not why We created you all from the same dust? That no one should exalt himself over the other.\u2019\nImagine if the handwriting of Jesus Christ were to be discovered, how extraordinary it would be for a Christian today to be able to actually see it! For members of the Baha\u2019i Faith like myself, it\u2019s a very special privilege to be able to experience alongside others, the original handwriting of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h. Usually such items are only on display for pilgrims who have made a special visit to see them in the Holy Land. Most of the pieces in the display have been lent specifically from the International Baha\u2019i Archives in Haifa, part of modern-day Israel, close to where Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h passed away in 1892. The house where he lived for the final years of his life, outside the former Ottoman prison city of Akka, is where a professor from the University of Cambridge, Edward G Browne (1862\u20131926), went to visit him in 1890.\nProfessor Edward Granville Browne of the University of Cambridge, in oriental dress.\nAn English professor meets Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\nBrowne was fascinated by the evolution and rise of the Baha\u2019i religion in his own time. In a unique pen-portrait, he left this description of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h:\nThe face of Him on Whom I gazed I can never forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemed to read one\u2019s very soul; power and authority sat on that ample brow\u2026 No need to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself before one who is the object of a devotion and love which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain.\nDuring those meetings, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h expressed to Browne the hope that:\nall nations should become one in faith and all men as brothers; that the bonds of affection and unity between the sons of men should be strengthened; that diversity of religion should cease, and differences of race be annulled\u2026 Let not a man glory in this, that he loves his country; let him rather glory in this, that he loves his kind.\nA year later, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h sent Browne a pair of reading glasses, originally a gift from a follower in Hong Kong. With them Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h enclosed a message:\nWe should like to send them to our true friend. Though by God\u2019s grace, he is endowed with outward and inward vision and has no need of them yet the object in view is a mention of us with him.\nThese glasses are also a rare and fascinating item in the display.\nSpectacles gifted to Professor Edward Granville Browne by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h. \u00a9 UK National Baha\u2019i Archives.\nToday several million Baha\u2019is around the world are working with their friends and neighbours for the spiritual and material prosperity of their communities. But, as this display reminds us, it all started with the markings of a pen on paper.\nYou can see the display The birth of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h: a bicentenary celebration of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith\u2019s founder in Room 34 from 7 November 2017 until 4 February 2018."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/a-winding-trail-following-serpents-dragons-and-other-water-beings-around-the-world/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "A winding trail: following serpents, dragons and other water beings around the world", "author": "Veronica Strang, Executive Director of the Institute of Advanced Study, University of Durham", "timestamp": "2017-10-31 00:00:00", "text": "30 years ago, facing another long winter and fed up with sitting behind a desk, I wrote to some old friends managing a cattle station in northern Australia\u2019s outback and asked if I could go and work with their stock team for a while. \u2018We\u2019ve never had a woman do that,\u2019 they replied, \u2018but why not?\u2019 It was an excellent adventure. I learned how to muster cattle, break horses, and survive eating beef three times a day (with little in the way of fruit or vegetables).\nVeronica Strang with her favourite horse. Photo: Clare Blackman.\nThe stock team contained a number of Kunjen elders from the nearby Aboriginal community of Kowanyama. Along with making daily jokes about whether I needed a box in order to get up on my horse, and broadening my diet to include fruitbat and wallaby, they were kind enough (as we herded unruly cattle along the Mitchell River) to teach me about their lifeways: their social practices, their religious beliefs and rituals, and the sentient ancestral beings inhabiting a sacred landscape.\nIn doing so, they introduced me to one of the world\u2019s most fascinating water beings, the Rainbow Serpent \u2013\u00a0a central figure in Aboriginal Australian beliefs about how totemic ancestors created the world and continue to generate life from within the land. I was hooked immediately, of course, and, on returning to England, studied Anthropology at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, and began research which, in the decades since, has increasingly focused on understanding people\u2019s relationships with water.\nSerpent beings regularly appear in Australian rock art, such as the ochre serpents in this cave in Chilligoe, upriver from Kowanyama. The Rainbow Serpent also features in traditional bark paintings, and in many contemporary paintings by Aboriginal artists.\nSupported by a Royal Anthropological Institute Fellowship, and Australian Research Council funding, I continued to work with Aboriginal groups in Queensland and other indigenous communities. In New Zealand, assisting the Maori Council in a legal claim to regain indigenous rights to water introduced me to another set of water serpent beings. For Maori, the rivers and seas are protected by powerful guardian spirits: taniwhas and marakihaus. And a recent landmark legal decision established that, in accord with their worldview, rivers are Tupuna Awa \u2013 \u2018living ancestors\u2019 \u2013 and must be respected accordingly.\nA wooden and painted carving of a marakihau above the door at the Moana marae (meeting house) near the harbour in Auckland. Photo: Veronica Strang.\nFurther research on water and cultural diversity for UNESCO, and then sheer curiosity, led me to many more historical and contemporary water beings \u2013 Babylonian leviathans, ancient Greek sea serpents, Celtic and Roman river goddesses, Norse dragons, rainbow snake deities in Africa, feathered serpents in Mexico, giant twin anacondas in Amazonia, the horned serpents of the American Pueblos, Indian Nagas. And, in China, Japan, Vietnam \u2013 indeed, right across Asia \u2013 a veritable plethora of dragons rising from the waves, flowing from wells and springs, and drifting through mountain mists and clouds.\nDragon emerging from the clouds.

It is hard to choose a favourite, but many people will recognise the gorgeous turquoise xiucoatl (twin serpent), an Aztec water being depicted in a pectoral ornament dating from between 1400 and the early 1500s. It is on display in Room 27.\nThe Aztec xuicoatl\u00a0on display in Room 27. Cedar wood, turquoise and shell, 1400s to early 1500s. The use of turquoise defines it as a celestial serpent, linking the waters of the earth and sky.\nWater serpent beings and dragons, it turns out, can be found everywhere in human history, and even now \u2013 though much subsumed by religious changes in some areas \u2013 they continue to wind their way through many cultural belief systems. But why? Why were water beings so ubiquitous in early human societies? And why do they remain important today? Why are they alike in key respects, while also being culturally and geographically unique? And why are they worshipped in some places and demonised in others?\nThese are the questions I have been asking, while following serpentine trails to understand the many and complex ways in which people engage with water. Water beings provide insights into human cognition and engagement with the material world. They show how water flows imaginatively through religious beliefs. And they have a lot to say about the kinds of relationships that different communities have with their environments.\nI am currently working on a book about water beings around the world, and most recently they wriggled their way into a paper written for the UN, to help them to encourage heads of state to give more priority to cultural and spiritual values in relation to water.\nYou can book your free ticket to see Veronica Strang explore some of the questions \u2013 and answers \u2013 about a range of water beings, in the lecture Water beings: historical and contemporary religious beliefs in the powers of water, on Thursday 23 November at 13.30.\nThe lecture relates to the exhibition\u00a0Living with gods: peoples, places and worlds beyond, which is on from 2 November 2017 to 8 April 2018.\nSupported by the Genesis Foundation.

Napoleon\u2019s Grande Arm\u00e9e and Hitler\u2019s Operation Barbarossa both famously serve as warnings of what can go wrong. The vastness of the steppes, the refusal of the enemy to meet in pitched battle, the savagery of the winters \u2013\u00a0all have regularly combined to frustrate the ambitions of even the mightiest empires. In ancient times, before the building of settlements in what are now Ukraine and Russia, the challenges that faced any would-be conqueror were even more severe.\nWe have no cities \u2013\u00a0nothing that we need worry you might capture. We have no crops \u2013\u00a0nothing that we need worry you might destroy. Why, then, should we be in any rush to fight with you?\nThese words were supposedly spoken two-and-a-half thousand years ago by the king of a people named the Scythians, the nomadic lords of a vast swathe of territories that stretched from Central Asia to Eastern Europe. His defiance was flung in the teeth of the most powerful man on the face of the planet: Darius, the Great King of Persia.\nImpression of the Darius seal cylinder seal showing Darius I. Found in Egypt, 6th\u20135th century BC.\nMilitary adventures had long been a specialisation of the Persians. For decades, victory \u2013 rapid, spectacular victory \u2013 had appeared their birthright. Their aura of invincibility reflected the unprecedented scale and speed of their conquests. Once, they had been nothing, just an obscure mountain tribe confined to the plains and mountains of what is now southern Iran. Then, in the space of a single generation, they had swept across the Middle East, shattering ancient kingdoms, storming famous cities, amassing the largest empire that the world had ever seen. A man such as Darius was not lightly defied.\nThe landscape of southern Siberia that Darius would have faced. This photo includes a Scythian burial mound. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017. Photo: V Terebenin.\nUnsurprisingly, then, in the face of Scythian intransigence, he had decided to take the offensive. In 513 BC, Darius crossed the Bosphorus at the head of a vast army, bridged the Danube, and struck deep into what is now southern Russia. He did so not merely to uphold Persian interests, but in defence \u2013\u00a0as he saw it \u2013\u00a0of the moral balance of the universe. Truth, the principle of light and order which animated the entire cosmos, was always under threat. The spreading filth of the Lie, were Darius not there to stem and purge it, risked splashing the radiance of all that was good with the poison of its sewage. Accordingly, then, alerted to the fractious character of the the Scythians, he had recognised in their savagery something ominous: a susceptibility to the seductions of demons. \u2018They were vulnerable, these Scythians, to the Lie\u2019 \u2013 and so Darius, ever the dutiful servant of the Truth, had felt himself called upon to pacify them.\nGold plaque of a mounted Scythian, in the words of Darius, possibly \u2018vulnerable to the Lie\u2019.

Darius\u2019 expedition did not suffer the humiliating rate of attrition endured millennia later by those of Napoleon or Hitler, but it did meet with stalemate. Although the Persians destroyed whatever of Scythian settlements and crops they could, they were unable to annex any territory, and ultimately, as winter drew in, found themselves with no choice but to withdraw. Darius himself, unsurprisingly, drew a veil over the whole business. The details of his expedition went unmentioned in any of his inscriptions. Forts that he had built deep within Scythian territory were abandoned. As the expedition passed out of living memory, it might very well have ended up forgotten altogether.\nAnonymous print of a portrait bust of Herodotus with a Greek inscription. Stipple on chine coll\u00e9, c. 1800\u20131825.\nThat it did not was due to a Greek who, some eight or so decades after Darius\u2019 invasion of Scythia, wrote about it as part of his \u2018researches\u2019 \u2013 his \u2018historia\u2019 \u2013 into the wars between the Greeks and the Persians. Herodotus, when he put words into the mouth of the King of the Scythians, or imagined himself in the mind of Darius, was not relying on authentic testimony \u2013\u00a0but what he could find out about the Scythians, he did. The result was indeed, just as Herodotus had hoped that it would be, a supreme work of enquiry \u2013 not merely the world\u2019s first work of history, but its first work of ethnography as well. It is thanks to Herodotus that a people who wrote no history themselves were enshrined in the memory of more settled people, and it is thanks to Herodotus that the efforts of archaeologists to redeem the Scythians from oblivion could to be cross-referenced with the writings of a man contemporary with them.\nA glimpse inside the exhibition.\nAs a translator of the Histories, I always found that the Scythians lived most vividly for me in its pages. In my efforts to understand what they might truly have been like, I felt like Darius, in pursuit of a quarry that seemed destined forever to evade my clutches. That is why the British Museum\u2019s exhibition has proven such a revelation \u2013 and so moving. At long last, I have seen the gold, and the clothes, and the horse fittings, and the tattoos, and the very nail clippings of a people I had always thought would exist for me only on the pages of Herodotus. Unlike Darius, I have got to grips with the Scythians at last.\nThe BP exhibition Scythians: warriors of ancient Siberia is on until 14 January 2018.\nSupported by BP."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/cauldrons-and-flesh-hooks-between-the-living-and-the-dead-in-ancient-britain-and-ireland/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Cauldrons and flesh-hooks: between the living and the dead in ancient Britain and Ireland", "author": "Jennifer Wexler, Digital Research Project Producer and Neil Wilkin, Curator of Bronze Age collections", "timestamp": "2017-10-26 00:00:00", "text": "Behind the scenes at the British Museum sometimes resembles Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. So when the British Library asked to borrow a 3,000-year-old cauldron for their exhibition\u00a0Harry Potter: A History of Magic, we were delighted!\nThe cauldron that is on loan was found in the River Thames at Battersea. It was made around 3,000 years ago, crafted from many separate sheets of bronze and skilfully riveted together. It was among the largest and most sophisticated metal objects of its day. The capacity of the cauldron is around 70 litres \u2013\u00a0enough to boil meat or brew beverages for a mighty feast. But it\u2019s not just a technological masterpiece, it was also a cherished object. All over its body are repair patches and pegs from heavy use, probably over several generations.\nThe Battersea Cauldron, c. 800\u2013600 BC.\nWe know cauldrons were important, symbolic objects because they were often deposited in unusual and special places in the landscape, for instance in bogs and rivers. These locations are often considered to be powerful because they are betwixt-and-between the domains of the living and the dead.\nCauldrons feature in later writings, including the Book of Leinster, which reflects earlier oral traditions. In these Irish stories, cauldrons are closely linked to chiefs and kings and their ability to redistribute food and drink as a symbol of their power. The most famous was the magic cauldron belonging to the Dagda, a protecting god and father figure. His cauldron overflowed with abundant food, could heal any wound, and even restore life to the dead \u2013\u00a0warriors killed in battle were lowered into the cauldron to be brought back to life. The link between cauldrons and supernatural powers is most famously captured in the witches\u2019 scenes from Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth. These stories are likely to echo much older beliefs about the power and magic of cauldrons, stretching back to the cauldron dredged from the Thames at Battersea.\nWe would also like to highlight this 3,000-year-old \u2018flesh-hook\u2019. As its rather sinister name suggests, it was used in the course of feasting, probably in combination with cauldrons \u2013\u00a0its curved prongs serving and stirring meaty portions. It was found in a bog in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, in an area that contained other objects associated with ancient ceremonies and rituals.\nThe Dunaverney flesh-hook, 950\u2013750 BC.\nThe rod-shaped flesh-hook is made up of three metal and two wooden parts. The most remarkable feature is the seven little bronze birds that decorate the metal sections. There are two birds of the crow family (probably ravens) and a family of swans (two swans and three cygnets). They appear to float along the flesh-hook in a bird-on-bird face off. The birds bob on small rods connected to metal rings dangling beneath their bellies. These could have been used to tie on other objects, perhaps even feathers taken from real birds.\nThe two sets of birds may have represented opposing forces in the world of ancient people.\u00a0Swans are white birds of the water but also associated with the sun and light, and the family group suggests fertility. The ravens, on the other hand, are black birds of the air and divine communication, connected with wild uplands \u2013\u00a0their dark colour and gruesome dietary habits were connected with war and death. These differences may have represented the competing forces of good and evil in the world.\nDetails of the birds on the flesh-hook.\nSimilar ideas come to us from much later sources including the Book of Invasions (Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn) and the Ulster Cycle (an R\u00fara\u00edocht), written down in the 8th century AD. In these myths, ravens are associated with war, death, land and goddesses. In the central tale of the Ulster Cycle, the goddess Badb takes the form of a crow or raven and causes chaos when she perches on the shoulder of the hero C\u00fa Chulainne, predicting his death. Both swans and ravens were connected with shape-shifting gods, objects of worship and foretellers of the future.\nThe places where cauldrons and flesh-hooks are found are associated with burnt mounds (fulacht fiadh) in Britain and Ireland, sites used for ritual feasting connected to seasonal cycles. The most famous festival mentioned in some of the earliest Irish literature is Samhain (pronounced so-ween). This ceremony marked the end of the harvest and the beginning of winter when the ritual fires were relit and the dead were honoured, an early version of some aspects of Halloween. It was a liminal time when the boundary between this world and the Otherworld could be easily crossed.\nAs you settle down to a scary movie this Halloween or reach for a Harry Potter book, imagine for a moment a late October evening in an ancient land. Cauldrons bubble and fires burn in the darkening days of autumn. A flesh-hook is wielded by a village elder, a renowned storyteller. She tells a tale of shape-shifting gods, of divine spirits in the form of birds and competing forces \u2013 good and evil \u2013 that bind the world.\nPerhaps not so much has changed, after all."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-british-museum-membercast-the-bp-exhibition-scythians-warriors-of-ancient-siberia/", "category": "Podcasts", "title": "The British Museum Membercast: the BP exhibition Scythians: warriors of ancient Siberia", "author": "British Museum and Andrew Shore", "timestamp": "2017-10-24 00:00:00", "text": "Book tickets now for the exhibition\u00a0Living with gods: peoples, places and worlds beyond\nBook now for the event\u00a0Transforming a gallery: the major refurbishment of Room 33\nThe British Museum Membercast is a monthly podcast made available to \u2018all studious and curious persons\u2019.

We stopped at a sculpture and I pointed out to the group that it is called the Tree of Life. The laughter that erupted afterwards still rings in my ears till today. \u2018How can this be called the Tree of Life?\u2019 asked one of them. A very good question indeed.\nCrist\u00f3v\u00e3o (Kester) Canhavato (b. 1966), Hil\u00e1rio Nhatugueja, Fiel dos Santos and Adelino Mat\u00e9, Tree of Life. Metal sculpture,\u00a02004.\nTree of Life is a piece of art that makes you stop and think. A superficial glance at it as you stroll through the galleries will show you a tree, its branches spreading in all directions and a small monkey climbing upwards. A closer inspection though, reveals a different story, for this is a tree that never \u2018grew\u2019 from the rich red soils of Africa. It is made from surrendered weapons used in the war that ravaged Mozambique for 17 years. The imaginative sculpture would more aptly have been named Tree of Death.\nTree of Life never stops to amaze and inspire me. When I look at it, all I can see is a new beginning and the rise of Africa from the ravages of war. I see growth and how we can change a very bad situation to a positive and inspiring one for all. I see an Africa standing tall and strong again. For me, the branches of the tree symbolise the strong protective arms of a mother shielding her children and the habitat under the tree from further damage.\nCorslet made from a mesh of coral beads on vegetable fibre.\u00a0Made by Edo or Bini people, Benin, 19th Century.\nTo a West African, coral beads symbolise wealth, prosperity and, most importantly, royal authority. They are also believed to contain supernatural powers and energy. \u2018It must be uncomfortable wearing these beads\u2019 was a comment I once heard during one of my visits to the African Galleries. It is surely difficult having one\u2019s body laced in coral beads, but there is a good reason for doing so, especially among the Bini and Yoruba of Nigeria.\nIn fact, coral is hugely popular in West Africa and is prized as much as gold. There is a saying among the Bini in Edo State that \u2018a child surpasses beads\u2019. To compare a child to the bead shows the high status that the bead occupies. The king wears coral beads like nobody else. He is adorned from head to foot in them. This is far from being adornments to enhance the appearance of the wearer. According to mythology, the wearing of the beads by the king is a deliberate act to constantly remind the king of the enormity of the responsibility he carries on his shoulders. The same is said too of a new bride wearing the coral beads around her neck as a direct reminder of the responsibility of marital life and of the authority of motherhood.\nPair of leopards, made of ivory with metal inlay. Edo people, Benin, 19th century.\u00a0\u00a9 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, 2017.\nLook closely at this figure and marvel at the craftsmanship that turned a piece of ivory into such an exquisite piece of art. I have always wondered how many hours were spent, meticulously shaping the raw material into this sculpture to make it fit for a king, fashioning the teeth and the whole body of the beast and with each spot carefully placed. Symbolising strength and royal power, this magnificent ivory beast would have adorned an Oba\u2019s palace.\u00a0So revered was the leopard that it even wears its own coral beads. A royal beast indeed.\nThe leopard sculpture is often used to decorate the Oba (King) of Benin\u2019s palace. Its presence in the Oba\u2019s palace goes beyond mere symbol of power and authority. According to Benin mythology, the spotty leopard, like the coral beads, is a reminder to the king of the comeuppances of ignoring ones responsibilities. The leopard was claimed to have done so, and as a punishment it got burnt by fire. The resultant scars from the burns are the spots that are all over its body to remind it of the consequences of disobedience and that there are other forces more powerful than it.\nIron eben, or chief\u2019s ceremonial dancing sword. Benin,19th Century.\nI remember seeing an African theatre drama workshop where a replica \u2018eben\u2019, a royal sceptre from the Kingdom of Benin was used. It was perceived as a war weapon because the people running the workshops used it as a prop and failed to explain its significance to the young people. We explained the eben\u2019s symbolic meaning to the young people and it was then that one of them, a Pakistani, made the cross-cultural connection between the shape and design of the eben and the Nalain (the slippers that the Prophet Muhammad wore on his way to see Allah). \u2018I will hold the eben differently from now on,\u2019 remarked the young man.\nIf you saw the eben being carried aloft and coming towards you, you would know at once that the king was not far behind! Outranking the coral and the leopard, the eben (ceremonial sword) reigns supreme in symbolising the power and authority of the king. It is not an \u2018ordinary\u2019 sword. It is a royal sword, fit only for a king.\nView of Room 25.\nGo to the African Galleries and go beyond the \u2018tree of life\u2019, conjuring up its contemporary images of Africa. Stand awhile and marvel at the richness of Africa\u2019s past and legacy and know that Africa is a continent worth discovering."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions-fun-for-all-the-family/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Exhibitions: fun for all the family!", "author": "Melany Rose, Education Manager: Schools and Young Audiences and Jane Batty, Interpretation Manager", "timestamp": "2017-10-19 00:00:00", "text": "Almost a third of visitors to the British Museum are families.

Well, good question. We have also been working to make temporary exhibitions more accessible and (dare we say it) fun for family visitors.

We have asked families to tell us what they think and we have spent time looking at who uses the resources and which are the most popular.\nFamily labels in an exhibition.\nWe found out that a lot of adults enjoy the labels as much as young people, because they provide a fun and fast way into the stories and themes. 95% of all our visitors think that labels written specifically for families are a good idea (we really want to convince the other 5% too!). The most popular labels are ones that invite visitors to look closely, to imagine, or include something that they can touch, listen to, or smell. Three-quarters of families who use the labels say their visit was enhanced because of them. Based on feedback we have made improvements to the labels such as reducing the number of words, making them more distinct and easier to find, and asking more open questions.\nBut we want to keep improving!

Sculpted with great originality, virtuosity and technical skill from mammoth ivory, this 40,000-year-old image is 31 centimetres tall. It has the head of a cave lion with a partly human body. He stands upright, perhaps on tiptoes, legs apart and arms to the sides of a slender, cat-like body with strong shoulders like the hips and thighs of a lion. His gaze, like his stance, is powerful and directed at the viewer. The details of his face show he is attentive, he is watching and he is listening. He is powerful, mysterious and from a world beyond ordinary nature. He is the oldest known representation of a being that does not exist in physical form but symbolises ideas about the supernatural.\nThe Lion Man. Stadel Cave, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, 40,000 years old. The oldest known evidence of religious belief in the world. \u00a9 Ulmer Museum.\nFound in a cave in what is now southern Germany in 1939, the Lion Man makes sense as part of a story that might now be called a myth. The wear on his body caused by handling suggests that he was passed around and rubbed as part of a narrative or ritual that would explain his appearance and meaning. It is impossible to know what that story was about or whether he was deity, an avatar to the spirit world, part of a creation story or a human whose experiences on a journey through the cosmos to communicate with spirits caused this transformation.\nObviously, the story involved humans and animals. Lion Man is made from a mammoth tusk, the largest animal in the environment of that time and depicts the fiercest predator, a lion, now extinct, that was about 30 centimetres taller than a modern African lion and had no mane. Distinct from other animals through their use of tools and fire, humans were nonetheless dependent on some animals for food while needing to protect themselves from predators. Perhaps this hybrid helped people to come to terms with their place in nature on a deeper, religious level or in some way to transcend or reshape it.\nAn experiment by Wulf Hein using the same sort of stone tools available in the Ice Age indicate that the Lion Man took more than 400 hours to make:\nThis was a lot of time for a small community living in difficult conditions to invest in a sculpture that was useless for their physical survival. Allowing this to be done might suggest that the purpose of the image was about strengthening common bonds and group awareness to overcome dangers and difficulties. Some support for this exists at the cave itself.\nArchaeological discoveries in other caves in this region include small sculptures as shown in the British Museum\u2019s 2013 exhibition\u00a0Ice Age art: arrival of the modern mind. They were found in caves with large quantities of stone tools and animal bones that indicate people lived in the shelter of the daylight areas of these sites for repeated periods of time.\nStadel Cave, where the Lion Man was found, is different. It faces north and does not get the sun. It is cold and the density of debris accumulated by human activities is much less than at other sites. This was not a good place to live. Lion Man was found in a dark inner chamber, carefully put away in the darkness with only a few perforated arctic fox teeth and a cache of reindeer antlers nearby. These characteristics suggest that Stadel Cave was only used occasionally as a place where people would come together around a fire to share a particular understanding of the world articulated through beliefs, symbolised in sculpture and acted out in rituals.\nLion Man is the oldest known evidence for religious beliefs and Stadel Cave suggests that believing and belonging have a deep history crucial to human societies and originating long before writing. In 2017, UNESCO acknowledged Stadel Cave and other Swabian localities as World Heritage Sites of importance to all humanity and I am delighted that Ulm Museum has loaned this important sculpture to the British Museum for the exhibition.*\n*Please note that the Lion Man sculpture has been rotated with a high quality 3D printed replica as of 31 January 2018, in a planned rotation at the request of the lender.\nThe exhibition\u00a0Living with gods: peoples, places and worlds beyond is on until 8 April 2018.\u00a0Supported by the Genesis Foundation.

Here are some key objects you will find in the show.\n1. Mosque lamp\nMost accounts in over 4,000 faiths surviving or recorded worldwide acknowledge the importance of light and water to life. Darkness allows human fears and sorrows full rein whereas the certainty that the sun will always rise in the morning offers hope. Equating light with life, goodness and/or a deity is a worldwide phenomenon. In the Bible, God commands that there should be light to drive away the darkness (Genesis 1:3) and Christ is equated with the morning star with the promise of life and everlasting day (Revelation, 22:16).\nMosque lamp. From Aleppo, Syria, \u00a0c. 1300\u20131340.\nSimilarly, the Qur\u2019an (24:353) epitomises Allah as the light of the heavens and likens this light to a glass lamp in a niche. This verse is inscribed in the calligraphy on this enamelled and gilded glass lamp from Aleppo. It also states that it was made for the mausoleum al-Salhibiyya al-Taqiyya, perhaps for the vizier Taqi al-Din who died in AD 1316.\n2. Zoroastrian tiles\nInner goodness is often equated as light and epitomised by fire. In Zoroastrianism, a religion that began in ancient Iran but is now centred around Mumbai in India, fire is the visual symbol of purity, an enlightened mind and a god who cannot be seen. No rituals can take place without fire. In these glazed ceramic tiles from a Parsi home shrine in Gujarat, the mighty, guiding fire of thought is shown at the centre so that prayers can be directed to it.\nTiles from a Parsi home shrine showing the constantly burning fire of Ahura Mazda, god of Zoroastrians. Gujarat, India, 1990.\nThe left and right panels depict the prophet Zarathustra, and Lohrasp, the legendary king of an ancient Iranian epic. Above their heads are the winged symbols of Faravahar, emblematic of the spirit of a human that exist before birth and again after death.\n3. Ibeji figures\nSpirits that persist after life are also a concern among the Yoruba-speaking peoples of West Africa. The Yoruba have a birth rate for twins that is four times higher than anywhere else in the world. They are believed to have special powers and bring luck, health and contentment to the family. Their birth is celebrated with immense joy but the death of one or both may bring dangers, as well as sorrow.\nIbeji figure. Yoruba, made in Nigeria, probably early 20th century.\nTo prevent bad fortune for the family and wider community, the parents commission the making of wooden ibeji that they take care of as a living person.\n4. Thangka depicting the wheel of life\nHumans think about death with trepidation and sorrow as the one certainty of their lives. This 19th-century Tibetan Buddhist thangka depicts the wheel of life. A thangka is used for teaching or as a devotional object, and this one shows the world in the arms of the demon Mara, indicative of temptation, death and impermanence. His limbs symbolise the sufferings of birth, sickness, old age and death.\nPainted textile (thangka) with the wheel of life. Tibet, 19th century.\nThe six segments show the higher realms of existence in the three segments at the top. The lower segments depict the sufferings of animals, ghosts and hell. The outer circle symbolises how our actions influence future lifetimes. Above the wheel on the right is Buddha showing the path to liberation by pointing to the moon and on the left a bodhisattva, a person capable of reaching nirvana but who does not do so out of compassion for others.\n5. Model of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre\nIn Buddhism, a better life and karma are achieved by giving up material things, meditating and being compassionate. Following in the footsteps of Buddha on a pilgrimage also helps. In Asia it is not only Buddhists who become pilgrims. Millions of Hindus trek up mountains, walk to the source of Ganges or visit the places where saints and teachers lived. For Muslims the pilgrimage to Mecca for hajj is an obligatory religious duty and one of the pillars of Islam.\nModel of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, 1750s.\nPilgrimage is also important in Christianity. Souvenir models of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem were made under the supervision of Franciscan monks working from drawings made by Bernadino Amico a, 16th-century monk and architect. An example of the former was collected by the Museum\u2019s founder, Sir Hans Sloane. Its roof can be lifted off to reveal the layout inside the church and the location of Christ\u2019s tomb.\n6. \u2018Hundred bird\u2019 coat\n\u2018Natural religion\u2019 is practised by traditional societies in many parts of the world. In south-west China, the Miao people get dressed up for an outdoor festival to reinforce spiritual links with ancestors of the community, strengthen bonds among the living and ensure good fortune.\n\u2018Hundred Bird\u2019 coat. China, 1950\u20131990.\nThis \u2018Hundred Bird\u2019 coat is made from hand-spun cotton woven and embroidered all over with birds, insects and geometric patterns. The birds are often seen as avatars linking the spiritual realms of the cosmos as they walk on land and fly into the sky.\n7. An Indian juggernaut\nIn south India festivals are often celebrated by pulling the image of a deity on a juggernaut from a temple to allow vast crowds to have auspicious sightings of one or more of India\u2019s 330 million deities. This scaled down replica of one of these processional chariots was acquired by the British Museum in 1793.\nLarge wooden model of a juggernaut for bringing deities out of a temple into the community. India, 18th century.\nIt did much to inform the public about the complex of numerous highly varied religious paths that were lumped together under the invented name \u2018Hinduism\u2019, which derived from the name of the people living in the Indus River region, for the purposes of census taking under colonial rule.\n8. A Japanese notice board rewarding information about Christians\nThe pursuit of the mystical provides individual and social identities that are emotionally sustaining but sometimes politically dangerous. This Japanese notice board from 1682 offers rewards for information against Christians. It reveals how authorities in Japan turned against Christianity, having initially allowed conversions by Jesuit missionaries.\nNotice board\u00a0offering of reward for information against Christians.

All groups appear to come to a shared narrative, which seeks to explain their community\u2019s place in the world, and to reconcile the transience of an individual life with the enduring existence of the group. They also seem to develop rituals which reinforce the belief in that narrative, and articulate the place of every individual within it.\nDiptych of the Resurrection and Descent of the Holy Ghost. These miniature painted panels show Christ rising from the grave and his mother and followers receiving the spirit of God, shown as flames on their heads. Made in Swabia, Bavaria, Germany, 15th century.\nBelieving and belonging appear, everywhere in the world, to be closely connected phenomena. To be a member of a group has, throughout human history, been to share its story and to participate on a regular basis in its enactment. These communal expressions of faith have been manifested in the objects used in or for religious practices.\nThese stories appear to be a virtually universal phenomenon. They usually articulate social behaviour and accommodate both the dead and those not yet born within one narrative. They are valuable forces for survival where communities confront threatening natural phenomena, such as Ice Age winters, drought or disease, or recurrent dangers like war. The stories and the rituals together are powerful forgers and markers of a shared identity. Even today, groups confronted by other existential threats often choose to reaffirm this pattern of believing and belonging.\nNeil MacGregor in Jerusalem overlooking the Old City. \u00a9 BBC. Photo: Charlie Clift.\nThe British Museum is embarking on a 30-part radio series, written and presented by former Director Neil MacGregor, and an accompanying exhibition which seeks to explore this apparently global human phenomenon. The project is the fourth partnership between BBC Radio 4 and the British Museum, following on from A History of the World in 100 objects, Shakespeare\u2019s Restless World and Germany: memories of a nation.\nAs Neil MacGregor says:\nQuestions of faith have, in recent decades, moved to the centre of the global political stage \u2013\u00a0an unexpected return to a centuries-old pattern. But what are the connections between structures of belief, and the structures of society? In this project, using objects from the British Museum, and talking to experts from many disciplines, we try to explore some of these questions, looking at communities from deep history to the present day, in Europe and around the world.\nAs always the starting point for the project is the British Museum\u2019s collection. Its depth and breadth means it is possible to find objects that reflect both living religious practices and faiths long extinct. While the questions and predicaments of humanity remain fairly constant, there is a wide variety of narratives and responses which are embodied in stories told and the different objects produced as part of religious practice.\nThe Lion Man.

The oldest known evidence of religious belief in the world. \u00a9 Ulmer Museum.\nThe series and exhibition both begin with a remarkable 40,000-year-old mammoth ivory sculpture known as the Lion Man. Depicting a lion\u2019s upper body on the lower half of a man, it is the oldest known image of a being that does not exist in nature. It is the earliest evidence we have of beliefs and practices, and shows humans\u2019 unique ability to communicate what\u2019s in our minds through objects.\nTiles from a Parsi home shrine showing the constantly burning fire of Ahura Mazda, god of Zoroastrians. Gujarat, India, 1990.\nThe focus moves from the emergence of societies to the elemental commonalities in all societies \u2013\u00a0fire, water, light and the seasons. The exhibition then looks at life and death, the protection of mother and infant, becoming an adult and the daily and weekly practices associated with faith. The show will also examine pilgrimage, looking specifically at Canterbury in Kent and Sarnath in India, festivals including the ancient Roman Saturnalia, Christmas, Kumbh Mela and the Siberian Ysyakh, and the concept of sacrifice, including ancient Greek animal sacrifice and Aztec human sacrifice. Objects will reflect polytheism, monotheism and atheism. The idea of living without gods is examined through objects from the French Revolution and the Soviet Union.\nThe Lampedusa cross made from pieces of a boat wrecked off the coast of Lampedusa, Italy, carrying refugees from Somalia and Eritrea. Made by carpenter Francesco Tuccio, 2014.\nWe conclude with the Lampedusa cross, a contemporary symbol of hope. The cross was made by Francisco Tuccio for refugees who had survived their boat sinking off the island of Lampedusa. At a time when the refugee crisis is placing huge extra demands on a small community, they are still able to think about the plight of others and go beyond protecting their self-interest, offering solace and hope through an expression of shared faith \u2013 transcending ethnic and cultural differences.\nThe radio series will broadcast from 23 October 2017.\n\nThe exhibition opens on 2 November 2017.\nSupported by the Genesis Foundation.

We turned to our history to create a collective national identity. We named national heroes that led rebellions against slavery and led us towards independence. We used text books that told us that the Africans transported to the Caribbean came from particular tribes. We recited their names like poetry: Ashanti, Fanti, Ebo, Coromantee. We researched and celebrated the literature, visual art, music and dance created by our turbulent history, one that included indigenous people, European invaders, enslaved and indentured peoples from Africa and India, traders and businessfolk from the Middle East, China and the Portuguese Jewish community. I came to live in the UK possessing this history.\nPlan and cross-section of the slave ship Brookes of Liverpool. Woodcut, 1789.\nBlack History Month in the UK came to mean two things for me: being asked to speak to young people about Caribbean history (and being surprised how little they knew) and always finding out some new and wonderful fact I did not know about the history of Black people in Britain. The story of John Simmonds, the slave press ganged into the British Navy who fought under Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar for example, the tragic Ethiopian prince fostered by Queen Victoria, or Septimius Severus, the Roman general. (All of this and more has been brilliantly brought together by David Olusoga in his book Black and British: A Forgotten History.)

Initially, the Scythians reared large herds of horses mainly for their milk and hides, but eventually were among the first people to harness the horse as a mount. As you can imagine, this was a great success for the Scythians as it meant they could expand their horizons by moving up to speeds of 30\u201340 miles an hour, they could push past environmental boundaries that immobilised those who travelled by foot, and their cavalry became the driving force behind their military might.\nBy the 7th century BC the Scythians were already master horsemen and controlled a vast corridor of land that stretched across southern Siberia, from the Black Sea to the fringes of northern China. This expanse of land was greater than the Achaemenid Persian Empire, who the Scythians outlasted.\nThe Scythians also invented the earliest form of a saddle, arguably one of their biggest contributions to human civilisation.\nSaddle with sweat-cloth, decorative cover and a crupper. This richly decorated saddle belonged to the\n\u2018personal saddle horse\u2019 of the chieftain from burial mound 5, Pazyryk, Altai mountains, southern Siberia, 3rd century BC. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017. Photo: V Terebenin.\nThis invention spread like wildfire across their sedentary neighbours to the south and has stood the test of time. Over centuries, the Scythians kept perfecting their horse equipment, which in turn meant they honed their horse riding skills.\nSaddle cover depicting a griffin from burial mound 2, Pazyryk, Altai mountains,\nsouthern Siberia, late 4th to early 3rd century BC. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017. Photo: V Terebenin.\nBut the Scythians did not stop there. They also invented an early version of a powerful composite bow that could discharge arrows at a considerably greater force and distance. They also designed the gorytos, a combined bow-case and quiver, that allowed a Scythian to carry both his bow and arrows together for easier access whilst on horse-back. These revolutionary inventions meant that the combination of a Scythian archer and his horse was a real tour de force.\nReconstruction of gorytos based on the excavated finds from Arzhan-2. Reconstruction: K. V. Chugunov.\nSo what do we know about Scythian horses? Recent DNA research has been carried out by an international team of researchers lead by Ludovic Orlando, on exceptionally preserved horse remains from Scythian tombs at Berel in eastern Kazakhstan and Arzhan in Tuva Republic. The analysis has revealed that, like the Scythians themselves, their horses varied from region to region.\nDetail of horse burials at Arzhan-2 with partially preserved horse gear in situ. \u00a9 Photo: Eurasien-Abteilung, DAI\nTheir diverse gene pool meant that they had a wide mixture of coat colourings such as black, bay, chestnut, cream and mottled. Further examination has also revealed that none of these horses were inbred, telling us the Scythians did not practise selective breeding. However, several of the horses carried gene variants associated with short-distance sprint performance, which suggests the Scythians favoured horses with an aptitude for speed. The Scythians reared strong, healthy and athletic horses and some were probably hand fed instead of being left to find their own pasture. This also tells us that horse domestication at this time started to undergo a different process to other animals reared purely for food and resources.\nHorse head gear from burial mound 2, Pazyryk, Altai mountains, southern Siberia. Late fourth to early third century BC. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017. Photo: V Terebenin.\nA Scythian and his horse was inseparable, even after death. The Scythians believed in an afterlife and were buried with all their earthly possessions to take with them into the next world. In cases such as at Arzhan as many as 200 horses were found harnessed and buried together with the dead. The quantity and variation of horses found here fits Herodotus\u2019 account that allied Scythian tribes offered sacrificial horses to each other as a way of paying their respects.\nArchaeology has also made it clear that the more important the person, the greater number of horses were offered. At the famous frozen tombs at Pazyryk, located high in the Altai region of southern Siberia, entire horses were found preserved within the permafrost still dressed in their magnificent ceremonial regalia. This dress included fantastic horned headgear, decorated saddle cloths and elaborate horse tack decorated with stylised animal imagery and sometimes coated in gold foil. This dress is believed to have been to transform the horse into a fantastic beast ready to transport the deceased into the afterlife, which further underlines the importance of horses in all aspects of Scythian culture.\nGold belt buckle depicting figures under a tree with horses, 4th to 3rd century BC. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017. Photo: V Terebenin.\nAnyone coming to the exhibition will be left in no doubt that horses were central to the Scythian way of life. Without them, it seems unlikely that the Scythians would have survived, let alone thrived and prospered for over 500 years.\nYou can buy\u00a0the beautifully illustrated catalogue in the Museum shops.\nThe BP exhibition\u00a0Scythians: warriors of ancient Siberia\u00a0is on at the British Museum from 14 September 2017 to 14 January 2018.\nSupported by BP."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/poetic-licence-the-museum-gets-lyrical/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "Poetic licence: the Museum gets lyrical", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2017-09-28 00:00:00", "text": "To celebrate National Poetry Day, we\u2019re taking a look at the diverse world of poetry at the Museum.

It\u2019s also a bit of an epic \u2013 so enjoy!\n5 poems inspired by objects\nYou might have heard of John Keats being inspired by various Greek antiquities in the Museum to write his Ode on a Grecian Urn. Or that the statue of Ramesses II in Room 4 has an intimate connection with Shelley\u2019s Ozymandias. Here are extracts from some other poems about or inspired by objects in the collection.\n1. The Burden of Nineveh\u00a0by Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1822\u20131888)\nAt over 4 metres tall, the Assyrian winged bulls or lamassu are some of the largest objects in the Museum. They once flanked a gateway in a king\u2019s palace and arrived at the Museum in 1852.\nLamassu\u00a0of Ashurnasirpal II. A colossal human-headed winged lion from the North West Palace at Kalhu.

The Benin Bronzes by\u00a0George the Poet (b. 1991)\nIn 2015 George the Poet took up our Huge History Lesson challenge to investigate and get inspired by a Museum object. George\u2019s poem tells the story of the Benin bronzes, a series of plaques depicting the Benin court following Europe\u2019s first contact with West Africa in the 15th century.\n3. The Botanic Garden\u00a0by Erasmus Darwin (1731\u20131802)\nThe Portland Vase may be named after its former owner, the Duchess of Portland, but it is in fact a Roman glass vessel from 2,000 years ago. It is perhaps best known for inspiring the work of potter Josiah Wedgwood.\nThe Portland Vase. Probably made in Rome, c. AD 1\u201325.\nIn 1791 Wedgwood sent a copy of the vase to his friend, the botanist and poet Erasmus Darwin (grandfather of Charles). Darwin wrote a homage to the object that was illustrated with plates by William Blake. Admired by Coleridge and Wordsworth, the verse helped to bring the vase to a wider public.\nOver the fine forms of Portland\u2019s mystic urn,\nHere by the fallen columns and disjoined arcades,\nOn mouldering stones beneath deciduous shades,\nSits humankind in hieroglyphic state.\n4. Inscribed on a Mummy Case by\u00a0Edward Carpenter (1844\u20131929)\nIn Room 62, alongside many other mummies, there is a coffin decorated in gold leaf with a painted wooden portrait of a Greek youth named Artemidorus.\nCoffin of a Greek youth called Artemidorus.

This\u00a0captivated the poet-philosopher Edward Carpenter, who wrote this moving elegy, the first line of which is \u2018Artemidorus, Farewell\u2019\u2026\nThey wrap the sacred linen o\u2019er thy head,\nThy features and thy hair they cover up,\nAnd round thy arms thy fingers and thy hands\nThey wind and wind and wind and wind the bands,\nAnd I shall see thee nevermore, my own.\nAnd then they\u2019ll paint\nThy likeness on the outer mummy case.\n5. Homage to the British Museum by William Empson (1906\u20131984)\nSince its arrival at the Museum in 1911, the small wooden Polynesian sculpture of the\u00a0Pacific god\u00a0A\u2019a has been a source of fascination and inspiration to artists, poets and others across the world.

The Epic of Gilgamesh\nThe Assyrian King Ashurbanipal (r. 669\u2013631 BC) collected a library of thousands of cuneiform tablets in his palace at Nineveh. It included letters, legal texts, lists of people, animals and goods, and a wealth of scientific information, as well as myths and legends.\nThe best known of these was the story of Gilgamesh, a legendary ruler of Uruk, and his search for immortality. The Epic of Gilgamesh is a huge work, the longest piece of literature in Akkadian (the language of Babylonia and Assyria). It was known across the ancient Near East, with versions also found at Hattusas (capital of the Hittites), Emar in Syria and Megiddo in the Levant.\nThe Flood Tablet. Fragment of a clay tablet with part of the Epic of Gilgamesh. Assyrian, 7th century BC.\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the earliest surviving poems we have and was probably composed in the 13th to 11th centuries BC. It tells the story of a semi-historical king, Gilgamesh, and his close friend, the hairy wild man Enkidu. This tablet, from more than 2,500 years ago, is part of it. It describes the meeting of Gilgamesh with Utnapishtim. Like Noah in the Hebrew Bible, Utnapishtim had been forewarned of a plan by the gods to send a great flood. He built a boat and loaded it with all his precious possessions, his kith and kin, domesticated and wild animals and skilled craftsmen of every kind.\nUtnapishtim survived the flood for six days while mankind was destroyed, before landing on a mountain called Nimush. He released a dove and a swallow but they did not find dry land to rest on, and returned. Finally a raven that he released did not return, showing that the waters must have receded.\nThis Assyrian version of the Old Testament flood story was identified in 1872 by George Smith, an assistant in the British Museum. On reading the text he \u2018jumped up and rushed about the room in a great state of excitement, and, to the astonishment of those present, began to undress himself.\u2019 Poetry sometimes has that effect on people\u2026\n2. The Tale of Sinuhe\nThe Tale of Sinuhe is one of the most famous texts from ancient Egypt. Written in verse around 1850 BC by an unknown scribe, it details the exploits of Sinuhe who is exiled from his country, but returns and is reintegrated into Egyptian society. The name Sinuhe means \u2018the son of the sycomore\u2019, and the sycomore goddess features throughout the\u00a0poem.\nProfessor Richard Parkinson from the University of Oxford, and formerly a curator at the Museum, worked with actress and writer Barbara Ewing to record a dramatic reading of one of the finest works of Egyptian poetry, The Tale of Sinuhe. The tale survives in many manuscripts, including one in a collection of texts now known as\u00a0the Ramesseum papyri.\nIn this video, Richard and Barbara discuss working together and the impact the poem can still have on modern audiences.\nRichard has also written a blog post all about the project and you can find out more about\u00a0the Ramesseum papyri\u00a0on the Museum\u2019s collection online.\n3. William Blake\u2019s Songs of Innocence and Experience\nA poet, printmaker and painter, William Blake is perhaps best remembered today as the writer of Jerusalem, later set to music by Parry. Some of his best-known artistic work combines his\u00a0poetry\u00a0with beautiful illustrations and decoration. Although he was working at the same time as the Romantic painters and poets, his style remains unique and distinct from his contemporaries.\nWilliam Blake (1757\u20131827), The Tyger from a printed book of\u00a0Songs of Innocence and Of Experience\u00a0(verso). Hand-coloured relief etching, 1794.\nBlake\u2019s work from the 1780s and 90s forms an important part of the Museum\u2019s prints and drawings collection. This page is from his work Songs of Experience and contains his famous poem The Tyger:\nTyger Tyger, burning bright,\nIn the forests of the night;\nWhat immortal hand or eye,\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\n4. A painted scroll by Suzuki Sh\u014dnen\nAt 3.5 metres high, this painting by Japanese artist Suzuki Sh\u014dnen (1848\u20131918) is a towering composition, yet the brushwork remains refined.\nSuzuki Sh\u014dnen\u00a0(1848\u20131918), Shokan bekishi zu (Composing a Poem in a Pine Valley). Ink on paper, 1906.\nIts subject is the contented solitude of the ageing artist himself as he wanders among the idealised mountains of his imagination. The\u00a0poem\u00a0at the top reinforces this feeling:\nWhat sort of man is this holding a staff\nGently walking and considering a\u00a0poem\u00a0as he goes?\n5. Homage to Mahmoud Darwish by Mona Saudi\nMona Saudi\u2019s series of screenprints are inspired by the poetry of the well-known Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish (1941\u20132008). Saudi has positioned verses of Darwish\u2019s poetry in conversation with her drawings. Darwish was an iconic figure and inspired many artists to create paintings and artists\u2019 books.\nMona Saudi (b. 1945), Homage to Mahmoud Darwish. Silkscreen and watercolour, 1979.\nThe verses in this drawing are from That is her image and This is the suicide of the lover (extract translated by Atef Alshaer).\nI wear you and take off the days,\nThere is no history before your hands,\nThere is no history after your hands,\nThey call you the alternative,\nI do not have language, between myself and my name there is a country,\nAnd I want to incarnate the trees,\nI bear witness that I have covered my name with silence,\nNear the sea\u2026\n6. Jade bi with a poem by a Chinese emperor\nThis jade disc is called a bi\u00a0(pronounced \u2018bee\u2019). It was made sometime towards the end of the Neolithic period or the beginning of the Shang dynasty, around 2000\u20131500 BC. Its function is unknown but such rings have been found in tombs.\nJade bi. Beijing, China, 1200\u20131050 BC. Inscription date: AD 1790.\nIt would have been revered as a precious antiquity from an early time. Eventually it became part of the imperial art collection and came to the attention of the Qianlong emperor (r. 1735\u20131796) who was a very enthusiastic patron of the arts. He was well known for writing comments on his art objects, particularly his paintings and his jades.\nThis disc has one of his poems inscribed on it. In it the emperor says that the ring was a cup stand and that he had looked for the jade cup which he thought it originally housed. He could not find one so substituted it for a ceramic Ding ware bowl.\n7. A Persian love poem on a tile\nTilework produced in Iran between the 12th and 14th centuries features strongly in the collections of the British Museum. Lustre-painted tiles, in particular, are amongst the most stunning pieces and represent both a high level of sophistication in craftsmanship and a diversity of subjects. Lustre-painted tiles adorned the interiors of both religious and secular buildings, and the subject matter could range from abstract or vegetal designs to depictions of animal or human figures. Inscriptions along the border could contain excerpts from the Qur\u2019an, prayers, or literature, but text did not always necessarily correspond to the image in the centre of the tile. In this case, however, a close connection ties verses on love to the image of a couple:\nTile in the shape of an eight-pointed star featuring a Persian love poem. Kashan, Iran, late 13th\u2013early 14th century AD.\nLast night the moon came to your house.\nFilled with envy, I thought of chasing him away.\nWho is the moon to sit in the same place as you?\nThe Museum\u2019s collection features other tiles probably produced in Kashan at the end of the 13th century, the inscriptions of which focus on themes such as romance and courtly life.\nTile in the shape of an eight-pointed star featuring a love poem in Persian. Probably Kashan, Iran, late 13th\u2013early 14th century AD\nPoetic licence: other poetry and poets at the Museum\n1. The Greek poetess Sappho on a pot\nIn ancient Greece women were generally excluded from public life and politics, but they did take part in domestic and religious rituals. The poet Sappho (630\u2013570 BC), who lived in Mytilene on the isle of Lesbos, gave a voice to women and female desire that has resonated throughout history. By the 19th century her poetry had made the word for an inhabitant of Lesbos a term for a woman who loves women \u2013 the original lesbian.\nRed-figured hydria (water-jar) likely depicting the poetess Sappho. Made in Attica, Greece, c. 450 BC.\nClassical art and literature celebrating same-sex relationships continued to provide inspiration for people living in later eras when homosexuality was criminalised. The brilliance of Sappho\u2019s poetry and its expression of female love and desire continues to inspire readers.\n2. For The Fallen\u00a0by Laurence Binyon\nLaurence Binyon came to work at the British Museum in the Department of Printed Books in 1893, but his first love was for prints and drawings. He transferred to that department in 1895, eventually becoming Keeper of the sub-department of Oriental Prints and Drawings in 1913. Binyon was also a published poet and in 1914, The Times\u00a0 carried one of his poems, For the Fallen, just seven weeks after the outbreak of the First World War. This poem soon became a focal point for public grief as the war developed and the casualties grew and would later be used on numerous tombstones and cenotaphs around the world, including the Museum\u2019s War Memorial.\nLaurence Binyon\u2019s poetry on the Museum\u2019s War Memorial.\nThey shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:\nAge shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.\nAt the going down of the sun and in the morning\nWe will remember them.\nRead the poem in full.\n3. Alfred, Lord Tennyson on the floor of the Great Court\nYou may have literally stumbled across this if you\u2019ve been in the Great Court.\nThe Tennyson quote on the Great Court floor.\nIt\u2019s a quote from Alfred, Lord Tennyson inscribed into the floor! Like many other eminent Victorians, Tennyson had used the Museum\u2019s Reading Room in the 19th century.\nAnd let thy feet, millenniums hence, be set in midst of knowledge\nThis is a short extract from his poem The Two Voices, first published in 1842. It encapsulates an appropriate sentiment for the purpose of museums in general.\n4. Homer\nHomer\u00a0is the name given by the ancient Greeks to the legendary author of the\u00a0Iliad\u00a0and the\u00a0Odyssey, two epic poems which are the central works of\u00a0ancient Greek literature. A marble portrait bust of Homer is on display in Room 22.\nMarble portrait bust of Homer. Roman copy of a Greek original of the 2nd century BC.\n5. Some of the muses (the ones who were in charge of poetry)\nThe nine Muses (with Apollo and Athene) on a sarcophagus. Roman, AD 200\u2013220.\nThe word museum comes from the Greek word \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd (mouseion). This was a place where the ancient Greeks worshipped the Muses, the nine mythological deities they believed were the source of all inspiration. The word \u2018museum\u2019 is a Latin version of \u2018mouseion\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s what we use in English today. So it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that you can find the Muses in the British Museum!\nThree of the Muses in particular were associated with poetry:\nErato was the Muse of lyric and love poetry, a type of verse that was accompanied by a musical instrument.\nErato in 17th-century dress.

I have been involved as an observer in some of the blockbuster exhibitions. I watched the terracotta warriors parcelled up in Xian and then unpacked and installed in the exhibition in London. I spent months traveling around the Mediterranean learning about Hadrian in preparation for the superb exhibition about that most remarkable of emperors.\nSo it was a familiar feeling, a couple of weeks ago, when I almost jogged across the Great Court to meet St John Simpson, Curator of the new BP exhibition\u00a0Scythians: warriors of ancient Siberia. We chatted in his office, stacked floor to ceiling with ring binders bursting with site reports from Central Asian digs, with walls festooned with large-scale maps of places I have never heard of, and he showed me around his exhibition. I use the term \u2018his\u2019 deliberately. The exhibition feels like the result of a lifetime\u2019s passion for and immersion in the subject. The objects, stories, and themes arranged not by a committee but by one man\u2019s enthusiasm and knowledge.\nA peek inside the exhibition.\nI knew almost nothing about the Scythians when I entered that gallery. By the time I left, I was thinking about world history in a different way. Like all the biggest and best British Museum exhibitions, this one contains loads of beautiful objects. Individually they amaze and inspire. The quality of workmanship reminds us that the ancients were just as skilled as any artisan today. The intimate domestic objects, food, and tattoos immediately establish a common bond of humanity across the intervening centuries. The ostentatious bling reassures us that if we modern humans are guilty of being obsessed with the superficial trappings of wealth and power, then we are certainly not alone.\nScythians with horses under a tree.

They tell a story of an ancient people and way of life that exist is a massive void in most of our knowledge of past. It shows us the material evidence of a warlike, nomadic, people who dominated the vast swathe of grassland between the borders of modern China and the Black Sea. It is a rebuke to those who thought the ancient worlds existed in isolation from one another and globalisation only began as European ships plunged into the Indian Ocean 500 years ago.\nEurasia has been about exchange, trade and travel long before the dawn of the modern era.

They follow you if you try to look away. There are lots of them, waiting in a zoo-like cage. Bunched together, old and experienced, they seem anxious to be off into the fresh air, although they seem glad to be looked at, and fond of staring children down. Everyone who sees them wants to pick them up, and examine them, and try a game with them.\nTheir job, of course, was to do battle. They are early chessmen for a board game that had originated far across the world in ancient India where local chessmen were very different-looking. The Lewis pieces, skilfully carved out of walrus tusks somewhere in Scandinavia, are designed for life in Britain in the 12th century. Indian chariots and camels disappear and warders (rooks) on guard and bishops take their place, and no one could ever mistake the kings (stately) or queens (worried).\n3D scan of some of the Lewis Chessmen\nThey were found in around 1831 on one of the world\u2019s truly beautiful beaches, silver sand and sparkling sea, on the north side of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides. Curators have sometimes been back there looking for more chessmen, but so far have had no luck. And if you go, that water is cold beyond words, so no jumping in.\nThe pieces had various adventures in the 19th century before they ended up in museums, where they certainly belong. Some are in Edinburgh, the remainder here in the British Museum, although recently a small party of the chessmen has gone back to the Isle of Lewis on a long-term visit, to preside over the exhibits in the Stornoway Museum and delight locals and visitors alike.\nMany years ago I wrote a small story book about the Lewis Chessmen.\u00a0Clive Hodgson drew the pictures and Roderick Maclean translated the whole thing into Gaelic. When it was published I went to the Stornoway Museum with Roderick and we read the story out loud half in English, half in Gaelic, while children from all over the island sat around us in a ring. I remember asking one of the teachers how she had managed to choose the three children that she had brought to the reading from the other children. Weren\u2019t the others cross? I asked. No, she said, I brought the whole school with me. That\u2019s all there are!\nIf you\u2019ve seen a very famous film about a boy wizard, you will have seen replicas of these fantastic figurines on the big screen. But, did you know why they picked these particular chess pieces? Well, I will tell you in my latest Curator\u2019s corner:\nThere is nothing like the Lewis Chessmen. Once there was a television programme when the public had to vote on the top ten exhibits. Everyone expected the usual gold things to win, but no! The Lewis Chessmen were securely within the top five. And rightly so.

They are studied by academics to try to better understand people from the past. I have been lucky enough to have been awarded a Collaborative Doctoral Award, based at University College London and the Museum, to study some of these individuals.\nWhat can we learn from these ancient human remains? My research focuses on remains from ancient Sudan. In particular, I look at the teeth of people who lived along the Nile between the Neolithic and the medieval periods, that\u2019s from around 6000 BC to AD 1500. Officially, I\u2019m called a dental anthropologist. I am looking at changes in the frequency of dental disease and gum disease, as well as how people were using their mouths. The idea behind this project is to link these dental changes to social, cultural and environmental shifts, clues to which have been suggested by archaeological investigation.\nRebecca in the lab looking at teeth.\nYou might say that studying human remains is a rather unusual activity. To give an idea of what it entails, I thought I might describe \u2018a day in the life\u2019 of a dental anthropologist. All of my data collection happens at the Museum, as large collections of human remains from cemeteries around Sudan were donated to the Museum by the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM, Sudan) in 2007. On a day-to-day basis, my work is surprisingly practical. Our store rooms are currently in a separate part of the Museum to our research lab. This means that each morning I need to transport individual skeletons from the store to the lab. It\u2019s pretty hard work and excellent exercise \u2013\u00a0building big arm muscles is certainly an unexpected bonus of my research!\nOnce in the lab I start recording each individual. This involves three stages: determining age and sex, recording the teeth, and photographing the teeth for digital recording of dental wear. Each of these stages are important. By determining age and sex we can better understand and interpret the results. For instance, some diseases are more common in older people, by accounting for age any unusual patterns can be highlighted.\nWhen recording the teeth themselves, I look firstly for which teeth are present. This means that each tooth, or fragment of tooth, must be identified and I must decide on its position within the mouth. Human teeth, while being quite distinctive from one another, can be difficult to identify in archaeological material. Luckily, my Master\u2019s degree in Skeletal and Dental Bio-archaeology (at the Institute of Archaeology, UCL) has prepared me for such challenges, as well as the fact that over the last year I have looked at over 15,000 teeth.\nNext, I look for signs of dental disease \u2013 also known as dental caries, dental cavities or tooth decay. It\u2019s unlikely that there was much dental care in many of the cultures from which the remains originate, and as such, some of the dental disease is fairly obvious.\nA massive abscess under a tooth that has been totally destroyed by dental decay, in the upper teeth of an individual from the medieval period.\nLastly, I photograph every tooth for digital analysis of the dental wear. We really don\u2019t use our teeth like we used to. Most people will go through life not realising that the shiny, white enamel of their teeth is slowly being worn away by use. But back in Neolithic and even in later medieval times, the food people were eating was much tougher and probably had bits of grit and other material in it. This meant that the enamel and even the dentine (the softer tissue that lies under the enamel) was worn away through life. This is useful for dental anthropologists, as the different rates and patterns of wear can tell us a little something about changing diets and food preparation.\nExposed dentine (yellow) and worn enamel (white) in the lower teeth of an individual from the medieval period, showing the process of digitally recording dental wear.\nSo that is my recording process, which I will repeat for over 500 individuals.\nOne of the results of my analysis so far is that there seem to be differences between the frequency of dental disease in male and female individuals during the medieval period. Clinical research suggests that females may be more susceptible to dental disease than males. However, what I have found is that it is not just dental disease that differs between the sexes, but gum disease, abscesses, tooth loss and even dental wear. These results might suggest that men and women had quite different diets during this period, or were perhaps eating food that had been prepared in different ways. This is an exciting discovery, that could illuminate some aspects of ancient Sudanese culture that are not yet clear. But it\u2019s just the beginning. As my research progresses, many fascinating results are coming to light, and I can\u2019t wait to see what the whole picture looks like in the end.\nAs my work is part of a Collaborative Doctoral Award, there are huge advantages to such a collaboration \u2013\u00a0not only the fantastic training opportunities at both institutions, but also the chance to bring aspects of my research to the public. I was recently privileged to be involved in the redesign of a case dedicated to bio-archaeology (the study of human remains) in Room 63.\nThe new display in Room 63.\nThe new display explains bio-archaeological techniques and shows examples of the diseases found in remains from the Nile Valley. The diseases found include leprosy, tuberculosis and even cancer, which until recently was thought to be a relatively modern disease. As well as this there are some fascinating examples of dental disease and dental wear.\nThis picture shows the preparation for mounting of a spine with advanced tuberculosis. The disease has caused the spine to collapse, so much so that this individual would have moved around bent at the waist by nearly 90 degrees.\nIf you want to learn more about the fascinating stories teeth and bones have to tell, I would highly recommend stopping by the new display to find out more.\nThe British Museum is committed to curating \u00a0human remains with care, respect and dignity.

Pen and brown ink, brown wash, heightened with white and touches of gold, on rose prepared paper, 1459\u20131463.\nOn one level, of course, it\u2019s a magnificent Renaissance drawing, the most important the Museum has acquired for many years.\u00a0Gozzoli was one of the leading Florentine artists of his generation, and this is a significant addition to the Museum\u2019s already spectacular collection of drawings from this period.\u00a0Dating from around 1460, it shows a group of standing and kneeling figures arranged on a sheet of striking pink prepared paper. By using delicate strokes of white heightening, Gozzoli builds up the sense of three dimensionality, emphasising the ridges and swags of the cloth and hinting at the roundness of the forms beneath.\nHe focuses very much on the draperies \u2013\u00a0the figures themselves don\u2019t interest him at this point. Some don\u2019t even have heads \u2013 those would have been studied in other drawings. And there would have been many other drawings, because this little sheet of pink paper is a preparatory study for Gozzoli\u2019s great masterpiece, The Journey of the Magi in\u00a0Florence\u2019s Palazzo Medici-Riccardi. None of them survive, though. This drawing is the only one we can identify with certainty.\nBenozzo Gozzoli, Entourage of the Young King. Fresco from the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi, Florence. Via Wikimedia Commons.\nThe Journey of the Magi is one of the great commissions of the Renaissance. The patron was Cosimo de\u2019 Medici, grandfather of the famous Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici\u00a0(or Lorenzo the Magnificent). He commissioned Gozzoli to paint the little chapel in the family\u2019s palazzo, which was completed in stages between 1459 and 1461.\nThe Journey of the Magi was an unusual subject to choose \u2013 family chapels in churches often focused on the lives of the saints \u2013 but this was a private religious space over which the Medici had full control. They were particularly devoted to the Magi \u2013\u00a0every year, at Epiphany (the feast of the three wise men), the Medici put together a splendid procession which would weave through the streets of Florence. They might have acted out the roles of the Magi themselves, but contrary to popular belief that isn\u2019t the case in the frescoes.\nThat beautiful blond young man on the horse isn\u2019t the young Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, as comparison with any portrait of Lorenzo will make abundantly clear. But the Medici are still there. Cosimo and his family are at the front of the Magi\u2019s entourage, along with numerous other portraits which presumably show the great and good of Renaissance Florence. Gozzoli is there too, a dignified expression on his face and his name inscribed in gold letters on his red cap.\nBenozzo Gozzoli,\u00a0Angels Worshipping. Fresco, left and right side of the chancel,\u00a01459\u20131460. Via Wikimedia Commons.\nThe Museum\u2019s new drawing is a preparatory study for the angels who were frescoed around the altar on the fourth wall of the chapel, the point to which the rest of the procession is heading. They are shown in a beautiful garden, kneeling and standing in neat rows as if arranged for a group photograph.\nWe can identify several angels who must derive from the studies in this drawing. It must have been made at the very final stages of preparation, to make sure that everything was exactly right. It goes to show how carefully Gozzoli prepared his great composition. The angels may be divine, but they\u2019re comparatively unimportant figures in the greater scheme of things. If Gozzoli took this much time over their draperies, then he must have made similar drawings for many other figures in the procession, not to mention portrait studies of the Medici and his other distinguished contemporaries who appear among the crowds.\nBenozzo Gozzoli, Madonna and Child enthroned with angels (verso of Study of angels).\u00a0Pen and brown ink, brown wash, heightened with white and touches of gold, on rose prepared paper, 1459\u20131463.\nThere\u2019s a drawing on the back of the sheet as well, which isn\u2019t related to The Journey of the Magi and, in fact, can\u2019t be linked with any of Gozzoli\u2019s known works. It shows the Madonna and Child enthroned with (more!) angels, sitting beneath an ornate canopy. It\u2019s much less polished than the other side and suggests that Gozzoli was only working out ideas. It has resulted in some odd visual effects. For example, the candlestick held by the angel kneeling in the left foreground rises up and up, and seems to transform into one of the slender columns holding up the canopy.\nI said that this drawing had particular resonance for me. The first time I ever saw Renaissance art was in a reproductive print hanging on the wall of the vestry in our village church. No one knew where it had come from or why it was there. But it showed two panels of angels in a beautiful garden, both sides facing inwards towards a tantalising gap. I spent my childhood looking at that picture. Now, of course, I know that it shows the two walls flanking the altar in Gozzoli\u2019s remarkable chapel \u2013 the very frescoes for which this new acquisition is a preparatory study. For me, Gozzoli\u2019s study of angels brings me full circle, to the picture which first made me fall in love with Florentine Renaissance art.\nYou can zoom in to this drawing and see all the fine details on our new Collection online here.\nThe drawing by Benozzo Gozzoli is on display for a limited time in Room 90a, between 5 and 28 September 2017."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/how-we-brought-the-scythians-to-london/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "How we brought the Scythians to London", "author": "St John Simpson, Assistant Keeper in the Middle East Department, British Museum", "timestamp": "2017-09-14 00:00:00", "text": "On 14 September we open our new BP exhibition Scythians: warriors of ancient Siberia,\u00a0which is organised with the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Russia. This marks an important moment in the long-term relationship between two of the world\u2019s oldest, largest and most encyclopaedic museums. Our exhibition is a tribute to Russian discoveries and research that began in the reign of Peter the Great and Russia\u2019s first museum, the Kunstkamera, and has continued with archaeological discoveries and new research up to today. It is the culmination of this year\u2019s celebration of Russian art and culture in the UK.\nA peek inside the exhibition.\nThe idea behind this exhibition began early in 2014. Internal discussions followed, and once it was agreed the proper work could begin. There was an exchange of letters between our directors, followed by curatorial correspondence, and I finally flew to St Petersburg in September 2015 to begin discussions in person.\nThe State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg.\nIt was a glorious autumn. I had been there before and have worked for many years in Central Asia with curators from the Hermitage and archaeologists from the neighbouring Institute for the History of Material Culture. I met the staff of the Hermitage\u2019s Department of Archaeology of Eastern Europe and Siberia, including Dr Svetlana Pankova, their lead curator on the project. It has been an absolute delight to work with her and all her colleagues there and in other departments, from Classical Antiquities and History of Russian Culture to Conservation.\nDuring that visit we looked at some of the wonderful Scythian gold objects from Peter the Great\u2019s Siberian collection which are on display in the Hermitage\u2019s Treasury, equally spectacular finds from frozen tombs at Pazyryk in the high Altai mountains, and other objects from their Black Sea displays. We also visited storage areas and started to draw up a wish list of objects. These included early lumps of cheese and whole sheepskin found in frozen tombs at Pazyryk, and the largest wooden Scythian shield ever found. Lengthy discussions then followed by email as the object list was refined, pieces sent for conservation and extensive new photography undertaken.\nSt John Simpson in the Great Court.\nIn November 2016 I returned to St Petersburg with two colleagues from our Department of Scientific Research. We were aiming to confirm the object selection, meet their scientists and see their laboratories, and come back with answers for a whole range of queries about the loan, including conservation, display, scientific research, publication and copyright. Winter came early that year, so the city looked very different \u2013\u00a0very few tourists, but blanketed in snow with ice-breakers working in tandem along the River Neva immediately outside the Hermitage\u2019s windows.\nSir Godfrey Kneller (1646\u20131723), Peter the Great, Tsar and Grand Duke of Muscovy.

We also had panel and label text to write, along with blogs and other social media posts. With other staff, we recorded interviews, wrote articles for magazines, planned events, decided on shop products, designed posters and adverts, and covered all the other myriad aspects which go into making an exhibition. Although some people think this is quite stressful, I try not to let it get to me. I find it\u2019s actually all about prioritising and answering as quickly as possible, and fortunately all our colleagues are very sympathetic, and know exactly what it\u2019s like through experience.\nProject Curator Chloe Leighton with one of the loan objects at the press launch.\nOn 30 May 2017 we held our press launch at the Museum, and this saw the beginning of the marketing campaign, with the first banners and posters going up on site. Since then, the Scythians have slowly made their way into people\u2019s consciousness through press articles in the Guardian, The Times\u00a0(\u00a3) and even a Game of Thrones piece in the Telegraph.\nA month later I returned to the Hermitage as part of a press trip where the invited journalists were able to interview the Director, Dr Piotrovsky, and see some of the objects as they were being packed to come to London.\nHermitage curator Dr Pankova explains the significance of the log coffin during the press trip.\nThe objects started to arrive with their couriers in early August and then the careful process began of unpacking, condition checking, mount making and tweaking the designs to show the objects to best effect.\nBritish Museum and State Hermitage staff undertaking scientific research on some of the gold objects from the State Hermitage Museum.\nThis was also a great opportunity to answer some questions we had about techniques used to make some of the objects \u2013 particularly gold objects from Peter the Great\u2019s collection \u2013\u00a0and this analysis was carried out by our Department of Scientific Research.

According to the Greek historian\u00a0Herodotus, when the Athenians learned that the Persians had landed at Marathon on the way to attack Athens in 490 BC, a messenger named Pheidippides ran to Sparta with a request for help. This original \u2018marathon runner\u2019 covered 260 kilometres of rugged terrain in less than two days! The Persians were subsequently defeated at the Battle of Marathon. The word\u00a0marathon\u00a0is the Greek word for fennel, which seems to have grown in the area and gave the battlefield its name.\nA dagger found at Marathon. Greece, 5th century BC.\nRunning was a key part of the ancient Olympics, although long distance races were not initially included. The\u00a0stadion\u00a0(or \u2018stade\u2019) race, a short sprint, was the most ancient \u2013 and indeed the only \u2013 event at the first 13 Olympiads. This is where we get the modern word \u2018stadium\u2019 and its winner had the Olympiad named after him. The track was not circular but straight, and measured approximately 192 metres.\nThe vigorous action of a sprinter. Amphora made in ancient Greece, c. 550\u2013525 BC.\nGradually other footraces were added to the programme at Olympia. The\u00a0diaulos, named after the musical double pipes, consisted of two lengths of the stadium, while the\u00a0dolichos\u00a0was a long-distance race, consisting of 20 or 24 lengths. The greatest Olympic runner of all was Leonidas of Rhodes, who won all three events at each of the four Olympiads between 164 and 152 BC. For a runner to maintain such a peak of fitness (all the running events were held on the same day) for 12 years was a remarkable feat and such was the pride of his countrymen that he became worshipped as a local deity.\nThe steady rhythm of three long-distance runners. Panathenaic amphora made in 333 BC.\nThe marathon as we know it today was not an event until the modern Olympic Games in 1896, and even then it varied in length. The first modern Olympic marathons were around 40km (25 miles), which is approximately the distance between Marathon and Athens. The marathon is the final athletic race in the Olympics, usually finishing in the stadium. The now standard length of 26 miles and 385 yards was originally run in the 1908 Games in London.\nBronze figure of a running girl. 520\u2013500 BC.\nWomen were excluded from competing in the Olympic Games, but they did have a festival of their own at Olympia. This was the Heraia, or games held in honour of Hera. These were also celebrated every four years, but there was only one type of event \u2013 the foot-race. It was divided into three separate contests for girls of different age groups. The winners were given crowns of olive like the Olympic victors, and they also received a portion of a heifer sacrificed to Hera. Just as the Olympic prize-winners were allowed to dedicate statues of themselves, so the girl victors were granted the privilege of setting up their images in the temple of Hera, but these were paintings and not statues.\nAt Sparta, girls seem always to have undertaken the same athletic exercises as boys, because tough, strong mothers were believed to produce good Spartan soldiers.\u00a0The bronze statuette of a girl runner above is probably from Sparta, where women were also expected to take part in athletics. Her appearance corresponds well with the ancient Greek geographer and writer Pausanias\u2019 description of the girls who raced in the Heraia: \u2018Their hair hangs down, a tunic reaches to a little above the knee, and they bare the right shoulder as far as the breast.\u2019 (Description of Greece\u00a0V\u00a016.4).\nFind out more about the ancient Olympic Games with Judith\u2019s book\u00a0The Ancient Olympic Games, available in the Museum\u2019s shop."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-sword-of-tiberius/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "The Sword of Tiberius", "author": "Thorsten Opper, Curator: Roman Collections", "timestamp": "2017-09-08 00:00:00", "text": "The so-called Sword of Tiberius is on display in Room 70, the Wolfson Gallery of the Roman Empire. It perfectly embodies Roman visual language and political propaganda, tied up with Rome\u2019s foreign wars and the imperial succession.\nThe sword was discovered in 1848 near the river Rhine, outside the German city of Mainz, which in antiquity was a vast legionary fortress and military command centre for the German frontier.\nThe scabbard is astonishingly well preserved and intricately detailed. The figurative scene on top is key to its meaning. In the centre is an enthroned male in classicising, divine garb with two attendant figures behind. Before him stands another male in military armour. They both have clear portrait features and were meant to be recognisable.\nThe sword\u2019s scabbard is remarkably well preserved.\nThe Museum\u2019s own labels used to say otherwise, but having followed the heated arguments about its iconography and context over the years, I am with those who recognise here the emperor Tiberius (r. AD 14\u201337), seated, receiving his adopted son Germanicus, commander-in-chief of the Roman army of the Rhine. The goddess Victory is to his left, and another deity, probably Mars, to his right.

Under the emperor Augustus (r. 27 BC\u2013AD 14), three entire legions had perished in Germany. First Tiberius, and then Germanicus, led punitive expeditions that resulted in a series of inconclusive, ever more Pyrrhic victories. Tiberius was clever: seeing the futility of these wars, he simply declared victory, granted the ambitious, gung-ho Germanicus a triumph and recalled him to Rome. As Augustus\u2019 stepson, Tiberius had long been overlooked for the succession and was then forced to accept Germanicus as his own crown prince in uneasy competition with the hugely popular, younger man.\nThe \u2018Sword of Tiberius\u2019. Iron sword and tinned and gilded bronze scabbard. Roman, c. AD 15.\nOne likes to think that this elaborate weapon belonged to a high-ranking officer, but this is by no means assured. What looks like gold and silver is in fact mostly tinned brass. The bigger story is clear \u2013 the new monarchy\u2019s legitimacy derived in large part from constant battlefield victories, and the absolute personal loyalty of the new professional military was crucial. Giving to the troops a powerful message of wise leadership by a united imperial family helped achieve this, and the army had the craftspeople to do so beautifully."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/drawn-together-how-the-museums-collection-inspires-students/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Drawn together: how the Museum's collection inspires students", "author": "Sarah Jaffray, Project Officer: Bridget Riley Art Foundation, Prints and Drawings", "timestamp": "2017-09-05 00:00:00", "text": "Drawing is popular again. With blockbuster exhibitions at the National Portrait Gallery and the Ashmolean and festivals like The Big Draw, drawing seems to be a big part of our cultural consciousness. It seems strange for me to suggest that drawing has ever lost its popularity, but when I started working as Project Officer for the Bridget Riley Art Foundation (BRAF) at the British Museum three years ago, I was told by some university Fine Arts tutors that students were actively hostile to drawing.\nSince then, BRAF Project Curator Isabel Seligman and I have worked with over 1,100 artists, art students, and tutors from across London and the UK to investigate the role drawing plays in their individual practices, and in higher education arts programmes. We discovered that many students had lost touch with drawing because it felt too basic. Anyone can draw. All it takes is a pencil and paper \u2013\u00a0it doesn\u2019t seem \u2018unique\u2019 or different enough from what has gone before.\nCentral Saint Martins students drawing in the British Museum\u2019s Prints and Drawings Study Room.\nThrough workshops and a touring exhibition curated from the Museum\u2019s Prints and Drawings collection (a collection that holds over 50,000 drawings from the 15th\u00a0century to the present), Isabel and I have tried to revive an interest in drawing, especially the practice of drawing from another artist\u2019s work. Workshops are open discussions guided by student and tutor interest. They touch on the context and media of the artworks and, most importantly, give students time to draw from drawing. Our hope is that through the practice of drawing, students can interrogate their working methods while in conversation with historic works of art. We have definitely seen resistance to what some feel is a command to copy an historic artwork. However, a majority of students have embraced what is for them a new method of learning.\nWays of knowing is a small display (currently on in Room 90a until 28 September 2017) that demonstrates the sort of work and ideas that have come out of our BRAF workshops.

In it, Riley explains: \u2018For me, drawing is an inquiry, a way of finding out \u2013 the first thing that I discover is that I do not know.\u2019 Working from this idea, students were encouraged to be curious and closely examine their artistic process through drawing.\nFor Crystal Chia her time drawing on the course profoundly impacted her practice. She explains: \u2018for the longest time I have abandoned drawing as my form of practice\u2026 This project has freed me from my analytic mind, reminding me of the importance of connecting to the reality of looking and observing, putting sight onto paper and allowing me to return to the most simple and direct way of making art.\u2019\nLeft: Crystal Chia, Self-portraits.

Graphite and black chalk on buff paper, c. 1850.\nAfter spending time with the drawing Portrait of a dead child in the Prints and Drawings Study Room, Chia began to reflect on the intensity of observation and exchange that happen in the process of making a portrait. Instead of making an exact copy, she was inspired to use a new approach to observation. She explains her process: \u2018I closed my eyes like the little child in the portrait and felt my face and body with my fingertips and translated that touch onto paper.\u2019 The lines of her drawings are the delicate tracery of touch; her shifting movements and perception are the real subject her Self-portraits.\nLeft: Karlin Wong, Figure Studies.

Pen and brown ink, brown wash, black chalk, squared in red chalk for transfer, 1567.\nFor Karlin Wong, drawing in the Study Room helped her realise that \u2018unfinished works can be a great source of inspiration.\u2019 She took inspiration from the schematic figural drawings of late Renaissance artist Luca Cambiaso (1527\u20131585). \u2018Works in progress\u2019 such as Cambiaso\u2019s preparatory drawing provide important lessons for artists seeking to learn new techniques for their own working process. From Cambiaso, Wong developed new associations between figure and abstraction.\nThe workshops also impacted the drawing practice of Cez Mckend. She explains: \u2018The project invited me to start thinking about drawing as research through the use of experimental process. The purpose was not to replicate, but to generate something new by a means of observing.\u2019\nCez Mckend (b. 1996), Artist\u2019s Sketchbook. Graphite, 2017. \u00a9\u00a0Cez Mckend.\nHer sketchbook, like those of most artists, is a place of experimentation and exploration. On these pages she is playing with marks, textures and spatial relationships.\nBefore taking part in the BRAF workshops Pequeno (n\u00e9 Jonas Mcilwain) had a sceptical view of drawing. After being exposed to diverse types of drawing in the Prints and Drawings collection, he found drawing became more integrated into his practice.\nLeft: Pequeno, Partial Circumference Attempt (detail).

Red chalk, on orange-red prepared paper, c. 1506.\nPequeno was influenced by studies in which an artist is \u2018working something out.\u2019 He discovered: \u2018The exposed process of drawing, like making a blue-print, is most effective as an idea-to-paper type of action.\u2019 He was most inspired by how Leonardo\u2019s hugely ambitious ideas were being worked out through drawing. Pequeno\u2019s calls his work a \u2018serious joke\u2019, trying to calculate the incalculable. In the above drawing, he is working out his relationship to the sun.\nOther works from artists Cicely Haslam, Joshua von Uexkull, Cecil Collins, Ingres, Margaret Stones, Bridget Riley, a follower of Hieronymus Bosch, Micah Lexier and Gerhard Richter are too numerous to show here, but are all on display in the gallery.\nBeyond the amazingly creative student interpretations and rarely exhibited drawings from the collection, Ways of knowing is also about bigger themes of BRAF. Isabel and I hope artists and non-artists will see drawing as a valuable method of research. We hope to inspire a better understanding of drawing as a diverse media that ranges from the playful to the intellectual. We hope Ways of knowing inspires you to explore our drawing collections and perhaps book an appointment to draw in our Study Room.\nYou can see these works and more in Room 90a until 28 September 2017."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/ladies-aglow-finding-the-colour-in-2000-year-old-figurines/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "Ladies aglow: finding the colour in 2,000-year-old figurines", "author": "Joanne Dyer, Scientist", "timestamp": "2017-09-01 00:00:00", "text": "Take a walk to the end of Room 73 at the British Museum and you will meet some of my favourite ladies. Made of terracotta and dressed in vivid shades of pink and blue, these Hellenistic figurines were once made all across the Mediterranean as offerings to be placed in tombs.\nA selection of terracotta figurines on display in Room 73.\nThey are painted using some of the most precious and vibrant pigments available in the ancient world, such as Egyptian blue, cinnabar red and bright pinks and purples known as organic lake pigments. Over the more than 2,000 years since these figurines were made, many of these colours have faded or peeled away but their flowery coloured garments have hidden properties \u2013\u00a0\u00adunder certain lighting conditions they \u2018glow.\u2019\nStatuette of a woman with duck and conch shell\u00a0from Canosa di Puglia in Italy, 270\u2013200 BC. From left: in visible light (VIS), and showing the visible-induced visible luminescence (VIVL) and visible-induced infrared luminescence (VIL).\nThis is because these pink and blue pigments are luminescent, which means that they are able to absorb light of a particular colour and then re-emit it at longer wavelengths. For pink organic lake pigments, particularly those made from the root of the madder plant, such as those in the ancient paint pot below, ultraviolet or visible light is absorbed and pink/orange light is produced.\nPottery paint saucer containing madder lake pigment, found at Hawara, Egypt, 1st century AD. From left: in visible light (VIS), and showing the UV-induced visible luminescence (UVL).\nFor Egyptian blue (a bright blue inorganic pigment), red light is mostly absorbed and infrared light is produced. Infrared light has no colour, but using a specially modified camera we can record the light emitted as photographic images, which appears bright white. As these properties are specific to these two pigments, we can use this to identify them on objects, even when very small particles remain.\nUsually these images are taken using two different experimental set-ups, but now thanks to new research carried out in the Museum\u2019s Department of Scientific Research, together with colleagues in Greece, we can use the same set-up to record both of these images. The new technique uses different colours of visible light, blue and red from LEDs in turn, to make the pigments luminesce. It is much safer for both objects and users.\nFrom left: detail of the figurine in visible light (VIS), and showing the visible-induced visible luminescence (VIVL) and visible-induced infrared luminescence (VIL).\nThe images can also show us where each pigment is present much more precisely than our eyes can make out. So by looking closely at both images we can see that although areas of the lady\u2019s dress appear pink (and luminesce pink/orange), the same area also shows some blue particles that are faintly luminescing white.\nBy allowing us to see that a mixture of blue and pink pigments were used to make the purple colour of the lady\u2019s dress, the new set-up also allows us to begin to understand more about the ancient painting techniques used to create these beautiful objects.\nYou can read the full paper on the new research here."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/hajj-pilgrimage-to-mecca/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Hajj: pilgrimage to Mecca", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2017-08-30 00:00:00", "text": "What is Hajj?\nHajj is the pilgrimage to Mecca (in modern-day Saudi Arabia), which every Muslim must make at least once in their lifetime, if they are able. It is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and a religious duty central to Muslim belief.\nHajj occurs in the month of Dhu al-Hijja, the last month of the Islamic calendar. The Muslim calendar is lunar, which means that the Hajj takes place progressively across all four seasons of the year rather than at one specific time of the year.\nIt involves a series of rituals which are performed in and around Mecca over a period of 5-6 days.\u00a0Muslims believe that the rituals of Hajj have their origin in the time of the Prophet Abraham. The Prophet Muhammad led the Hajj himself in AD 632, the year of his death.\nThe Hajj now attracts around three million pilgrims every year from across the world.\nPostcard showing the Ka\u2018ba, Mecca. Printed by Sarawat Printers & Designers, Saudia Arabia, c. 2011.\nHajj for me was a dream come true, walking on the holy land where once prophets have walked and talked. It was a magic journey.\nNaureen Khan, Sheffield\nWhy is Mecca so important?\nThe city of Mecca is the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad, and where he received the message of Islam, which transformed Mecca into the holiest city in the Islamic world.\nMecca has been a sacred site from ancient times. Even before Islam, Mecca was an important site of pilgrimage for the Arab tribes of north and central Arabia. During the sacred months, such as Dhu al-Hijja, violence was forbidden within Mecca and this allowed trade to flourish and as a result Mecca became an important commercial centre.\nThe sanctuary at Mecca (Masjid al-Haram) with the Ka\u2018ba and the well of Zamzam at its heart is the place towards which Muslims pray every day. The Ka\u2019ba, which literally means \u2018The Cube\u2019, is a square empty building which is otherwise known to Muslims as the \u2018House of God\u2019.\nThe first House [of worship] to be established for people was the one in Mecca. It is a blessed place; a source of guidance for all people.\nQur\u2019an 3 \u2013 Al \u2018Imran: 96\nWhat does Hajj involve?\nHajj involves a series of rituals that take place in and around Mecca over a period of five to six days, some of these include:\nIhram\nThe pilgrim must travel to one of the designated Miqat, or \u2018stated places\u2019, a boundary where they must don their pilgrimage clothes: Ihram. This consists of two pieces of unstitched white cloth for men, and any modest clothing for women. Ihram is not only clothing, but the intention to perform hajj in a peaceful manner.\nTawaf\nThe first of the rituals is tawaf in which pilgrims walk around the Ka\u2018ba seven times in an anticlockwise direction.\nWhen my grandfathers spoke to me as a child about their experience of Hajj, they told me of the physical attraction they felt towards the Ka\u2018ba, that they felt drawn to it by an almost magnetic pull.\nArtist Ahmed Mater al-Ziad\nAhmed Mater al-Ziad (b. 1979), Magnetism.

Poster, 20th century.\nWuquf \u2018Arafat\nLiterally meaning \u2018standing\u2019, this ritual refers to the most important vigil that takes place from noon to sunset on the 9th of Dhu al-Hijja on the plain of Arafat.\nThe stay at Arafat was the most surreal moment in my life. Millions of people around me\u2026 quietly contemplating or loudly crying for forgiveness. As the day moves on, silence descends and the sun feels hot no longer\u2026 I will never forget the sound of warm afternoon wind which seemed to ignore so many around me \u2013 how can a place so crowded with millions be so quiet?\nUmair Ghori, Gold Coast, Australia\nAt Muzdalifa\nAccording to tradition, Muzdalifa, situated between Mina and Mount \u2018Arafat, is where pardon is granted and where Muslims gather the pebbles used to throw at the Jamarat (pillars) in Mina. Here pilgrims collect a minimum of 49 pebbles. The Prophet Muhammad stated that stones should be neither too big nor too small, approximately the size of a chickpea.\nAt Mina\nThese stones are used at the three pillars set within the valley of Mina close to Mecca which represent the three times that Satan attempted to tempt Abraham. They are known as Jamrat al-\u2018Aqaba (the largest), Jamrat al-Wusta (the middle one) and Jamrat al-Sughra (the small one).\nZiad Antar (b. 1978), Hajj tents.

There are tens of thousands of these mounds scattered across the vast steppe region which stretches from northern China through southern Siberia to the northern Black Sea.\nAerial photo of Scythian burial mounds. \u00a9 Ghent University, Department of Archaeology, 2007.\nThey are often clustered in groups or lines, and these likely represent tribal or family cemeteries. Some are small, others are very large, and where they are intact the grave goods show that the larger the burial mound, the higher the status of the deceased. Many of the mounds have been archaeologically excavated but most had been looted in the past. The tomb robbers searched for gold or other valuables, but they also desecrated the dead bodies and destroyed tomb memorials.\nThe archaeological excavation of tombs provides us with a great deal of evidence about Scythians of all ages, ranks and genders as the grave goods include everyday items, objects of high value and others which were made especially for burial. The selection and arrangement of these in the tombs show that, like most societies past and present, the Scythians believed in an afterlife.\nView of Scythian burial mounds under excavation at Bai-Dag II. \u00a9 K V Chugunov.\nThe Scythians took great care to prepare the dead and practised a form of mummification. The best evidence for this comes from burial mound sites like Pazyryk in the high Altai mountain region of southern Siberia. In this region the winter snow and rain percolated into the tomb chambers below the larger burials. These patches of ground never warmed up enough to defrost in summer, so the contents became preserved in the ice.\nThe tattooed corpses of the Scythians were carefully dissected. Their entrails were removed and replaced with straw before sewing up the cuts with animal tendon. Small holes were also carefully cut in the sides of their skulls and the brain matter was also replaced with dry straw. The men had been shaved and sometimes the fingernails were clipped and buried with the dead person. The bodies were then dressed and placed in hollowed out and dressed log coffins. Some of these coffins were decorated with carved scenes or tin foil covered leather appliques showing rows of birds or striding elks.\nThe deceased were accompanied by a range of personal items, either placed in the coffin or on the floor of the tomb-chamber. At Pazyryk these included personal ornaments, mirrors, low tables, braziers, small vessels made of wood and pottery, knives, and leather bags and pouches. Meaty food offerings were also left for the deceased and the charring of the hemp seeds in the braziers imply these were lit and the aromatic smoke filled the chamber before they finally went out.\nLog coffin from burial mound 1 at Pazyryk, 1929. \u00a9 Archive of the Institute for the History of Material Culture, St Petersburg, \u041e.3587.18.\nThe tomb-chambers were effectively log cabins. They were built of larch wood logs which were felled nearby, incised with marks and dragged on rollers to the burial place before reassembling. The ends of the logs were notched so that they interlocked and the logs used for the roofs were dressed. The floors were made of planks. The carpentry skills suggest that these people built similar structures for use in winter. Inside the tomb-chambers, felt coverings were added to the floors and nailed to the walls. This was mostly undyed dark felt but some of them had coloured designs and show rows of roaring lions\u2019 heads and other figures.\nExcavating inside the tomb-chamber in burial mound 2 at Pazyryk with the finds still trapped in the ice, 1948. \u00a9 Archive of the Institute for the History of Material Culture, St Petersburg, O.1672.54.\nTree ring dating of the five large tombs at Pazyryk show that they were constructed over a period of 48 years. Radiocarbon dating proves that they date to the mid-fourth to early third centuries BC. The roofs were covered with layers of leaves of cinquefoil (Dasiphora fruticosa) and sheets of larch and birch bark which were sewn together and lined with moss. The birch bark must have been removed in spring. This is confirmed by the presence of small flowers belonging to white-yellow scabious (Scabiosa ochroleuca L.) as these only flower here in late June and early July.\nView of burial-mound 5 at Pazyryk with traditional seasonal shelters around, 1949. \u00a9 Archive of the Institute for the History of Material Culture, St Petersburg, \u041e.1590.6.\nThe use of birch bark as insulation also suggests that the ancient Scythians may have made other temporary shelters of similar materials, still a common practice in this region as late as the mid-20th century. However, birch does not grow in this high mountain region so this material must have been brought here from nearby valleys.\nThe personal saddle-horses of the deceased were killed and buried with their owners. The corpses were lowered with ropes into the grave-pit and placed immediately outside the tomb-chamber. They were accompanied by their horse harness, and their bodies arranged in rows facing east, the direction of the rising sun.\nRecent horse DNA analyses from different sites show that not all the horses were related \u2013 it is quite likely that some were gifts left by different horse-breeding tribes. A unique four-wheel cart with its draught horses was also buried in burial mound 5 at Pazyryk, along with a large felt hanging and an imported pile carpet. The pit was then carefully backfilled with hundreds of logs and stones, and the worn and sometimes broken tools used in digging the ground \u2013 wooden wedges, massive mallets, shovels and log ladders \u2013\u00a0were thrown in. The final stage was building a burial mound of boulders and gravel over the top, and at Pazyryk these are up to 46 metres across.\nSection through burial mound 5 at Pazyryk. Drawing: Paul Goodhead after S I Rudenko, Frozen Tombs of Siberia.\nThe main burial mounds at Pazyryk belonged to high-status men and women. However, all had been robbed in antiquity, so there were very few intrinsically valuable objects in these tombs. This probably also explains the lack of many weapons, which were typical grave goods at other Scythian sites.\nInterior of the unrobbed main grave at Arzhan-2. \u00a9 Eurasien-Abteilung, DAI.\nOther sites add more information about Scythian burial practices, such as the large intact burial mound at Arzhan-2\u00a0in the Tuva region of southern Siberia. Its recent excavation proves that these burials sometimes contained large amounts of gold personal ornaments, as well as highly decorated weapons, and the types of objects found at the earlier discoveries at Pazyryk.\nUltimately, the archaeology of death is fundamental to our understanding of the Scythian way of life. It is from Scythian tombs that we have direct evidence to try and help us work out what these people were like.\nRead more about some of the objects found in burials in this blog post.\nSt John provides a handy introduction to the Scythians in this blog post.\nThe BP exhibition Scythians: warriors of ancient Siberia is on at the British Museum from 14 September 2017 to 14 January 2018.\nSupported by BP.\nYou can buy the beautifully illustrated catalogue in the Museum shops."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/solar-eclipses-then-and-now/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "Solar eclipses, then and now", "author": "Jonathan Taylor, Curator, Middle East", "timestamp": "2017-08-21 00:00:00", "text": "When I read ancient texts, it always strikes me how the people whose lives I glimpse in them are so instantly recognisable.

Fired clay statue from Ur, c. 2000\u20131750 BC.\nKnown as Utu to the Sumerians, and Shamash to the Assyrians and Babylonians, the sun was one of the most important gods of Mesopotamia (ancient Iraq). Each day he appeared through the doors of heaven in the mountains far to the east, crossed the skies, then disappeared through the doors of heaven in the mountains far to the west. On his journey, he saw everything. So he was worshipped as judge over heaven and earth. Life on earth was short, hard and brutal.

The Mesopotamians had the misfortune to live in a world they did not understand. Minor infections could be fatal, famine was commonplace, and justice was rough. People blamed misfortunes on offended gods, evil demons or witches. Eclipses could be particularly dangerous and frightening. They were countered by elaborate rituals that involved banging drums and singing lamentations. In the face of such adversity, one ancient song declared \u2018My love is a light that brightens (even) an eclipse.\u2019\nA ritual for fending off any evil that may strike during a lunar eclipse. Clay tablet inscribed with cuneiform writing, from Uruk, c. 200\u2013100 BC.\nClues to divine will were everywhere, including in the sky. A scholarly reference book listed 7,000 predictions based on astrological signs alone. The movements of the heavens didn\u2019t cause events to happen on earth. They were warnings of things that could happen here:\nSky and earth both produce portent; though appearing separately, they are not separate (because) sky and earth are related. A sign that portends evil in the sky is (also) evil on earth, one that portends evil on earth is evil in the sky.\nThe ancient Manual of the Diviner. Clay tablet inscribed with cuneiform writing, from Nineveh, 7th century BC.\nTo the Mesopotamian eye, far distant stars formed pictures in the sky \u2013 great twins, crab, lion, furrow, scales, scorpion. These would give their names to a zodiac of 12 signs, each occupying 30 degrees of sky. Most of today\u2019s zodiac signs derive from them. They would later feature in personal horoscopes, which were rather different from what you will find if you look for yours today:\nYear 243 [=69 BC] On 20th\u00a0Nisannu in the 9th\u00a0hour the child was born\u2026 that year on 28th\u00a0Abu [=20\u00a0August] a solar eclipse when watched for was not seen in the end of Leo\u2026 that child\u2026 good fortune\u2026 good fortune will diminish.\nA personal horoscope for a child born in 69 BC. Clay tablet inscribed with cuneiform writing, from Babylon, 69 BC.\nIn the ancient world the Babylonians were famous for their stargazing skills. Their seven-century-long programme remains one of the longest series of systematic astronomical observations in all history. This knowledge was prized from India in the east to Egypt and the rest of what was then the Greek world in the west. The 2nd-century AD astronomer Ptolemy eagerly drew on Babylonian astronomical records dating back to 747 BC, and much else besides. His Almagest (the name later given to it in the Islamic world, from where it came to Europe), dominated astronomy before Copernicus\u2019s revolution in 16th century AD.\nThe Mesopotamians would have scoffed at doomsday theories circulating again now at the eclipse (previously debunked by NASA). Nibiru (actually Nebiru\u00a0\u2018Crossing\u2019, a name for the planet Jupiter) was a favourable planet, and they knew its motions well. During the Assyrian empire, the rituals normally performed to protect the king during an eclipse were not needed when Jupiter was visible.\nThis tablet is the earliest surviving diary of systematic astronomical observations. Clay tablet inscribed with cuneiform writing, from Babylon, 652 BC.\nThe Babylonian day was divided into 360 units. The same units measured the orbit of the sun, meaning angles of up to 360 degrees (yes, you can ultimately thank them for that bit of maths). Likewise the idealised year in astronomy had twelve 30-day months, making 360 in total. The Babylonians knew well enough that reality was more complex, and had correctly identified how many extra months needed to be added, and when. Timing was crucial. Throughout the year specific days were lucky or unlucky for doing various things. Astronomy and astrology were one system.\nI\u2019m fortunate to be curator responsible for thousands of Mesopotamian astronomical/astrological texts, many being original manuscripts (rather than later copies, as is typical for Greek texts). Scholars from around the world are patiently translating them. Within living memory they have transformed our understanding. Mesopotamian experts made discoveries and came up with new ideas all the time. Imagine how awestruck they would have been had they known that in fact the earth revolved around Shamash, that the stars were similar to him and that their own fragile human bodies were made up of tiny particles from such stars (surely proof of his divine power!)\nPierre Brebiette (d. 1642),\u00a0Aut Deus naturae patitur.

There, the American Atheists are holding their annual convention. As they listen to talks on science, space and technology, and watch the eclipse together, they will experience no less awe at the wonders of the universe than did the ancient Shamash-worshippers.\nAlthough people remain separated by beliefs today as much as ever before, we share the basic human curiosity about our place in the universe and a thirst for knowledge. We\u2019re lucky to live at a time when we can learn from so many other people, past and present. We have ever more information, and can better understand what it all means.

The image of Herschel is a copy of an image originally taken by early photographer Julia Margaret Cameron in 1867.\nIn March 1839 Sir John Herschel (who became a British Museum Trustee in 1841) also presented his photographic research to the Royal Society. He had been involved in improving photographic processes for some years and published his discoveries in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1842. Herschel is also thought to be the person who coined and popularised the phrase \u2018photography\u2019 and shared his developments with Fox Talbot.\nThe earliest photographs of the Museum\nIn around 1843, Fox Talbot took an early calotype photograph of the first home of the British Museum, Montagu House. Although this is probably the first photograph of the Museum, it is barely recognisable as a building, due to the sensitive material deteriorating in the heat on a hot summer day.\nThis early calotype photo of Montagu House was taken by photography pioneer William Henry Fox Talbot, in around 1843, shortly before the final part of the house was completely demolished in 1845.\nAround the same time, Scottish photographer John Muir Wood photographed the view east along Great Russell Street, showing the entrance gate of Montagu House. Taken in less haste, the resulting image is far more recognisable (compare it with this earlier drawing).\nView of Great Russell Street and Montagu House, taken by John Muir Wood around 1843.\nFox Talbot continued to experiment and spent some time at the Museum in the mid-1840s, but his experiments were not successful and the Trustees decided against adopting his method.\nIn 1850 Charles Lock Eastlake became president of the Royal Academy, and became a British Museum Trustee. He had been the secretary of the Fine Arts Commission, Keeper of the National Gallery (later its first Director) and had an interest in photography, becoming the first president of the Photographic Society in 1853. This appointment, followed by the Great Exhibition of 1851 which displayed the new medium, was the catalyst that brought photography to the public\u2019s attention.\nRoger Fenton and the later 19th century\nIn 1852, the Museum began its association with Roger Fenton, another pioneer of photography, who had been involved in foundation of the Photographic Society with Eastlake. He was initially engaged to photograph cuneiform tablets, but that soon developed into taking pictures of other antiquities.\nA stereoscopic image inside the Museum taken by Roger Fenton in the 1850s. The images have been morphed into an animated gif, giving the impression of a 3D image.\nTo provide him with a suitable space in which to work, architect Sydney Smirke built the Photographic House on the Museum\u2019s roof (in order to maximise light levels). Fenton supplied his own chemicals and paid his own assistants.\nThe British Museum. Photograph by Roger Fenton, 1857.\nIn 1859, photography at the Museum ground to a halt. Photography was an expensive process \u2013 an annual outlay for paper, chemicals and other materials was estimated at between \u00a340 and \u00a350 (around \u00a36,000 in 2017 prices). The Trustees decided this was too much and suggested a compromise with Fenton, where he would take the photographs, but the process and printing would be carried out at the South Kensington Museum (later the V&A), as that was subsidised by the government. Fenton objected to this suggestion, and his association with the Museum came to an end.\nIn 1873 the Museum permitted the Autotype Fine Art Company to use Fenton\u2019s now vacant studio for a number of projects \u2013 curators, historians and scientists now wanted photography to support their publications. The studio was continuously used by photographers until the 1960s when it became a graphic art studio, and was demolished in the 1990s.\nRoger Fenton\u2019s studio was built on the roof. Here it is pictured in the late 1980s, when it was being used as a graphic art studio.\nSenior Photographer Kevin Lovelock explains the process of producing an early photograph:\nExternal photographers employed by the Museum before the 1920s would have objects delivered to the studio and placed onto a table or open shelves. A plate camera was positioned and the lighting was adjusted by drawing or opening the blinds next to the glass roof and the photograph was taken. An assistant would take the glass plate to the darkroom. The resulting negative would be placed into a contact printing wooden frame and, using slow sensitised printing out paper (known as POP) it was taken outside onto the roof of the building to expose. Once it had achieved the desired degree of exposure it was brought back into the darkroom and developed, washed and fixed.\nIn 1904 the Trustees approved plans for a new Museum building to the north of the site (now known as the King Edward VII building), to be built by architect John James Burnet. His plans included a new daylight studio with four adjacent darkrooms in the attic space. The new building opened in 1907 and the space was rented out to external photographers \u2013 there was still no official Museum photographer in place to produce photography.\nThe first \u2018official\u2019 photographer\nOn 5 November 1927 the British Museum appointed Donald Stanley Lyon as its first official photographer. Born in Walthamstow in 1891, Lyon\u2019s first job was as a butcher\u2019s shop assistant. Quite how he became a photographer is unknown, but it is understood that he began working at Fleming & Co in 1919 until he was \u2018poached\u2019 by the Museum in 1927.\nThe Museum\u2019s entrance hall in 1929. Although taken after Donald Lyon was employed in 1927, we do not know if he took this shot.\nBy 1930 the Photographic Service department (of two) was inundated with requests. The shift to in-house production meant that the Photographic Service grew to a team of four by 1939.\nThere are many other photos in the Museum\u2019s archive dating to between Fenton\u2019s departure and the appointment of Lyon. They include shots of the galleries by Frederick York of Notting Hill, taken in around 1875.\nThe First Egyptian Room (now Room 65). Photograph by Frederick York, around 1875.\nAnother photographer, Donald Macbeth, seems to have held a quasi-official position at the Museum. He regularly photographed the galleries, staff and the collection between at least 1906 and 1932. He took this photo in 1908 of one of the \u2018ethnographic galleries\u2019).\nEthnographical Galleries (view of Asia section). Photograph by Donald Macbeth, 1908.\nPost-war expansion\nIn 1963 the Photographic Service proposed a move to 1 Montague Place \u2013 a larger property comprised of three floors, a basement and a garden. Following a series of architectural updates, the building reopened in 1978. The basement of the building was given to the British Library\u2019s microfilm unit, the ground floor housed six printing darkrooms, while colour labs and two studios were situated on the first floor. By 1984, the department had 34 members of staff, meaning 1 Montague Place could no longer provide sufficient space, so satellite studios were constructed around the Museum to ease the pressure.\nThe Museum\u2019s COMPASS database in the early 2000s meant scanning 10,000 transparencies.\nIn the late 90s the Museum wanted to provide visitors with a new digital database (called Compass). Between 1998 and 2000, the department scanned approximately 10,000 transparencies (7,500 5\u00d74 inch and 2,500 35mm) for 5,000 objects. New object photography was also taken as a series of sequences that provided a 360-degree view of the object using QuickTime software (a precursor to 3D modelling like Sketchfab). Panoramic views of the galleries were also photographed, offering a \u2018walk through\u2019 of the Museum \u2013 a very early version of what is now possible via\u00a0Google Street View.\nDigital and beyond\nIn the 1990s the Museum began to invest in digital photography. The first digital system used by the Museum was in the guise of a digital scanning back \u2013 the Powerphase FX. This scanner could be fitted into any existing technical large format (5\u00d74 inch) camera, without having to adapt from film to digital.\nThe Museum\u2019s first purely digital studio was opened in 2001, and film photography was gradually phased out. In 2004 the Museum decided to terminate film processing and printing, and the name of the department changed from Photographic Services to Photography and Imaging. Darkrooms and processing machines were no longer needed, so many of the studio spaces were repurposed. 1 Montague Place was demolished in 2010 to make way for the Museum\u2019s new World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre (WCEC) building.\nPhotographer Saul Peckham working on the first 3D shot taken in the new World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre photographic studios, in July 2014.\nIn 2014 Photography and Imaging studios moved to one centralised location in the WCEC. The space is home to four studios with 3D shooting sets and a digital scanning suite.\nWhat do we do now?\nJust as Fenton was employed to take images of objects, object photography is still central to the work of the department today. Having an up-to-date record of the object is essential for research and publications, but also for marketing, publicity and social media. In the age of Instagram, the quality of the picture can make all the difference to sharing objects with the world in their best possible lights.\nThe Museum\u2019s Instagram feed shows off images from the collection and the building.\nAnother step on from object photography is the relatively new process of 3D scanning. With these models, people can see the objects from many different angles, and manipulate it themselves using platforms such as Sketchfab.\n3D model of the Rosetta Stone on Sketchfab.\nThere\u2019s even the potential to 3D print replicas. Essentially though, this is an extension of what the photographers have been doing for over a century.\nThe Scientific Research Department also produces images of objects using X-radiography or other methods. These help us to find out more about the objects in the collection \u2013 for example this image taken by Scientist Caroline Cartwright\u00a0is of biscuit beetle found in 3,000-year-old bread!\nA biscuit beetle found in 3,000-year-old Egyptian bread. Image taken using a scanning electron microscope.\nSometimes, the image is the object. The African rock art image project consists of around 25,000 digital photographs documenting rock art from across the continent. These are in fact digital files \u2013 the first in the Museum\u2019s history. As more artists choose to produce work digitally, storing digital artworks will become more common.\nThe great crocodile of Tin-Habeter. Wadi Mathendous, Libya. \u00a9 TARA/David Coulson.\nApart from object photography, Museum photographers are often required to travel across the UK and the world to take images for the Museum \u2013 both objects and other shots. The Museum also sometimes commissions external photographers to document events and exhibitions \u2013 often for use in marketing or advocacy work.\nA shot of the Members\u2019 event A Christmas Carol in December 2016. Photo by external photographer Benedict Johnson.\nThe future\nOne of the main changes since early photography is that most people now have instant access to taking a photo, usually via a phone. Visitors take thousands of photos of the Museum every day \u2013 some of objects, some of the building, definitely some selfies \u2013 but in an immediate way that the early pioneers could only dream of. The creation of photographic images may have exploded in the last few years, but great skill is still required to compose a shot properly, and produce a high quality image.\nAlthough notoriously difficult to predict future changes in technology, it seems certain that the Museum will continue to value photography \u2013 in all its forms, past and present \u2013 as a vital way to document and explore the collection.\nMarble bust of Lucius Verus, 161\u2013170.

Founded around 200 BC, the Great Shrine of Amaravati was one of the earliest, largest and most important Buddhist monuments in the world.\nThe Asahi Shimbun Display Virtual pilgrimage: reimagining India\u2019s Great Shrine of Amaravati.\nThe importance of Amaravati and its sculptures\nLocated near the ancient city of Dharanikota in the present-day state of Andhra Pradesh, the site flourished for over a thousand years. The city had important trade links throughout South and Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka and the Mediterranean world. The Great Shrine\u2019s domed structure, or stupa, contained a relic, perhaps of an important spiritual teacher or of the Buddha himself, who died sometime between 490 and 400 BC.\nThe site was gradually abandoned during the 14th century, and by the late 18th century materials from the Shrine were being recycled for new buildings and temples. In the 19th century a series of archaeological campaigns recovered the surviving sculptures. Today, the pieces are shared across a number of museum collections in India and around the world. The British Museum\u2019s collection features over 120 sculptures from Amaravati, the single most important group of Indian sculptures outside the subcontinent.\nThe relief on display\n3D model of the Amaravati double-sided limestone relief on Sketchfab.\nOne side of the relief on display, carved around 50 BC, shows devotees gathering around an empty throne with their hands clasped in gestures of reverence, while heavenly figures hover above. In the foreground are footprints, and rising behind is a Bodhi tree, under which the Buddha attained enlightenment. These three symbols evoke the Buddha\u2019s presence. When this relief was carved, symbols may have been used because it was believed that the Buddha liberated himself from the earthly realm, never again to be reborn within the confines of the human body.\nOne of two sides of a relief from the Great Shrine of Amaravati, evoking the Buddha\u2019s presence symbolically as an empty throne, a Bodhi tree and a pair of footprints, c. 50 BC.\nAround AD 250, during a major renovation, the relief was turned over and the stone reused. Recycling materials ensured the gifts of former donors continued to benefit the development of the site. The later side was carved with an image of the Great Shrine itself, revealing what it may have looked like. It shows the dome covered in Buddhist symbols and stories, while the Buddha himself stands in bodily form at the gateway, flanked by devotees.\nDetail of the later side of the relief, showing an image of the Great Shrine itself and the Buddha in bodily form, c. AD 250.\nPilgrimage and devotion\nPilgrims from many walks of life funded the construction and adornment of the Great Shrine over hundreds of years. Donations (dana) were a way of attaining spiritual merit (punya) in this life and the next, ultimately bringing devotees closer to enlightenment or Buddhahood. According to the Buddha\u2019s teachings, anyone could achieve this state of bliss, regardless of social background. The identities of these donors are revealed through Prakrit inscriptions written in Brahmi, one of India\u2019s oldest scripts, carved onto individual sculptures.\nPermanently engraved on stone, they allowed devotees to remain close to the Buddha\u2019s presence at the Great Shrine. They include an inscription carved above the 3rd-century side of the relief which says that it was the gift of a female disciple (amtevasikini) of the venerable monk (bhadamta) Vathisara, who lived in an unidentified place called Kurera. This inscription, worn and damaged over time and almost illegible, was recently translated for the first time. I am grateful to Vincent Tournier and Arlo Griffiths for producing a preliminary transcript and for explaining its meaning.\nThe display explores the identity of the female disciple, along with the donors of other sculptures in the collection. These include a 1st-century BC perfumer called Hamgha who, along with his sons and daughters, donated a pillar, a 1st-century AD Buddhist monk called Budhi who donated a \u2018lion-seat\u2019 (probably a support for a lion statue) with his sister Budha (a nun), and a 2nd-century AD woman called Kumala who, along with two other women called Sagha and Saghadasi, donated an elaborately carved railing pillar.\nExplore using new technology\nIn the display these four individuals are dramatically brought to life by actors and projected onto the gallery walls. Using new mobile technology, you will be able to use your smartphone to interact with these characters and to reimagine the donors that made the Amaravati site possible.\nThe annotated relief in the display will unlock more information about the object.\nThis creative approach to storytelling enables us to highlight the importance of ancient inscriptions which are crucial for understanding the historical and social significance of sites such as the Great Shrine. \u2018Opening up\u2019 the gallery walls has allowed us to playfully experiment with its otherwise protected and untouched surfaces.\nThe Asahi Shimbun Display Virtual pilgrimage: reimagining India\u2019s Great Shrine of Amaravati, supported by The Asahi Shimbun, is in Room 3 from 10 August to 8 October 2017.\nBuy our detailed research publication\u00a0to learn more about the Great Shrine of Amaravati."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/object-journeys-working-with-the-kiribati-community-in-the-uk/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "Object journeys: working with the Kiribati community in the UK", "author": "Polly Bence, Project Curator: Oceania", "timestamp": "2017-08-08 00:00:00", "text": "When I was asked back in 2014 to start thinking about the upcoming Object Journeys project, my mind immediately turned to the possibility of bringing the British Museum\u2019s Micronesia collection in to focus. The Department of Africa, Oceania and the Americas has close links with some of the members of the Kiribati Tungaru Association (KTA) and, together with the Object Journeys Partnerships Manager Kayte McSweeney and Oceanic Curator Julie Adams, we decided to reach out to the UK\u2019s Kiribati community.\nWhere is Kiribati?\nThe Republic of Kiribati (pronounced Kiribas) is an island nation that straddles the equator and is situated between Australia and the Hawaiian Islands. A group of 16 of these islands were once known as the Gilbert Islands and were part of the British colony the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, for a little over 100 years from the late 19th\u00a0to the late 20th\u00a0century.\nTaking three flights and almost 30 hours to reach the islands from the UK, Kiribati is made up of 33 islands and coral atolls dispersed over 1.3 million square miles of Pacific Ocean. Today more than half of the 112,000 population live on the island of Tarawa and over recent years people have relocated to Fiji, Australia, New Zealand and the UK.\nThe Gilbert Islands gained independence from the UK in 1979 and the Republic of Kiribati was formed. The newly formed Republic included the Line Islands and Phoenix Islands which lie to the east of the Gilbert Islands, as well as Banaba or Ocean Island, which lies to the west.\nMap of Kiribati. \u00a9 Mark Gunning, courtesy Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Cambridge.\nThe collection\nThe Kiribati collection at the British Museum is largely made up of objects collected during this period of the islands\u2019 history. From dance ornaments to coconut fibre armour and everything in between the Museum looks after almost 600 objects from what were then called the Gilbert Islands, as well as objects from modern-day Kiribati.\nThis growing collection offers insights into the material culture of this island nation. Objects like baskets and fish traps are not only practical, made with a deep knowledge and skill of local materials but they are also very beautiful, delicate and artistic. Dance ornaments and garments show how people celebrated the art of dance, performance, storytelling and song. This tradition continues today and the I-Kiribati are well known and greatly respected for their dancing.\nModel canoes, canoe ornaments and the many fish hooks in the collection demonstrate a thorough and historic understanding of the surrounding Pacific Ocean, how to travel between islands and what it takes to thrive in this environment. These objects survive as testament to the sophisticated navigators of days gone by.\nIn 1972, Sir Arthur Grimble, Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands from 1926 to 1933, wrote:\nBefore setting sail in the fair weather season, a Gilbertese mariner will sometimes spend several days looking at the sea. If it is streaked in places with calm patches of an oily appearance he will refuse to start until these disappear, for they speak to him of strong currents. When visited by a squall of rain between islands, or when travelling by night with only a sense of direction to guide him, the sailor observes the waves. If these suddenly change in direction he knows that land is near.\nCanoe mast or pennant made of wood, pandanus leaf and fibre. Donated to the British Museum by Sir Arthur Grimble in 1921.\nUnique to these islands is the incredible defensive armour made of coconut fibre. When worn with a helmet made of porcupine fish and a waist belt made of porcupine ray skin, the Gilbertese warrior was a formidable sight (albeit fairly immobile).\nPractised historically across the islands, one-on-one battles as well as intense group warfare took place over land and resources \u2013 and with solid and fertile land at a premium it\u2019s not hard to imagine why. The collection houses 48 different pieces of armour and a multitude of weapons lined with rows of shark teeth. This art of warfare is no longer practised on Kiribati and ceased with the introduction of Christianity in the mid-19th\u00a0century.\nThe Rev Samuel James Whitmee, in his marvellously titled 1871 publication,\u00a0A missionary cruise in the South Pacific being the report of a voyage amongst the Tokelau, Ellice and Gilbert islands, in the missionary barque \u2018John Williams\u2019 during 1870, wrote:\nAnother manufacture worthy of being noted is a very singular suit of defensive armour, consisting of corselet, trousers, armlets and cap all made of cocoa-nut fibre. The corselet is a very fine piece of workmanship.\nHelmet, cuirass and waist-band made of coconut fibre and human hair, collected Charles Richard Swayne, Resident Commissioner in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, before 1895.\nNo objects from the Kiribati collection have been on display at the British Museum since the exhibition Pattern of islands: Micronesia yesterday and today in the 1980s at the Museum of Mankind and the Object Journeys project is a fantastic opportunity to showcase some highlights of this wonderful collection onsite in Bloomsbury for the first time.\nThe earliest object from the Gilbert Islands to be registered into the collection was a piece of armour \u2013 a coconut fibre cuirass in 1848, and our most recent acquisition is a dance costume made in April 2017 by a practising I-Kiribati artist. This costume is on display in the Object Journeys Kiribati case in Room 24. The black raffia skirt on display was donated by Chloe Karea, one of the members of the group who curated the display.\nCollaboration\nIn the Oceanic section we don\u2019t often get the opportunity to work for an extended period of time with a community group, and certainly have not focused on the Kiribati collection before. It has been a real privilege for us to meet members of the community who have tangible experience and knowledge of living in the islands. Some members of the group were born and raised in Kiribati while others are second or third generation I-Kiribati and all have spent time on the islands.\nObject Journeys project partners explore the Kiribati objects in the Museum stores.\nThe Republic of Kiribati is so vast, as well as being many thousands of miles away from the UK, and it is easy to make sweeping generalisations and believe that you understand the landscape (or in this case, seascape). After exploring various themes and narratives with the group, we now have a clearer understanding of Kiribati as a place, its location in the world, what the challenges are, and how these affect people living there on a daily basis.\nWe have learnt that it is near impossible to speak in one voice as there are many nuances between the islands. The Object Journeys group have chosen themes that speak to all the islands rather than pick out specific objects which might only represent one or two islands. This is itself a difficult task, but one that has been achieved with much consideration, respect and careful thought from the group.\nWe have also learnt that people living in Kiribati continue to be adaptable and resourceful, and absolutely nothing goes to waste. Resources are scarce on the islands and the coconut tree is utilised for all that it can offer \u2013 the wood, shell and coconut fibre is prepared and turned into cordage which is used extensively. The pandanus plant is another resource that is used in its entirety and in many ways, especially in dance costumes.\nAfter undertaking her PhD fieldwork on Tabiteuea (one of the islands) Guigone Camus explains:\nalthough the inhabitants acknowledge the reality of the constraints if their land, their symbolic conception of the environment and their skill at making the best use of it allow them to live in harmony with their surroundings. With only a small variety of plant species (compared to those provided by a continental or volcanic island), they transform all the usable parts of the plants, exploiting them for food as well as for utilitarian and medical purposes.\nHistorically shell valuables were traded and exchanged with neighbouring islands as a way to source rare materials, foster relationships and ensure survival. Pearlshell is not widespread throughout Micronesia and therefore shells found on adornments like this neck ornament are extremely valuable and are likely to have been imported from elsewhere.\nPearlshell, pandanus leaf and coconut fibre neck ornament. Purchased from the collection of John Spencer Noldwritt in 1891.\nCollaborating with the Kiribati community group has been an eye-opening journey and we have been privy to subjects that are difficult to talk about, such as the increasing tension between the land and the encroaching ocean. Necessary for everyday survival, people are faced with the monumental challenge living life surrounded by rising waters and with that, the very real possibility of the loss of more land.\nIn his 2014 exhibition catalogue of\u00a0Tungaru: The Kiribati Project, arts writer Mark Amery wrote:\nThe only nation to bestride all four hemispheres \u2013 north, south, east and west \u2013 the Republic of Kiribati in the centre of the Pacific could be considered to be at the heart of the world. And in this new century, at the heart of the world\u2019s concerns.\nObject Journeys project partners develop design and interpretation ideas for the new display.\nThe community group\u2019s first-hand experience has been invaluable for curating and producing a display of Kiribati material and we are thrilled to have had this opportunity to work with them and learn much more about the Kiribati objects in our care.\nObjects on display in Room 24.\nObject Journeys is a community collaboration project at the British Museum and with three UK partner museums that is supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund.\nThe three-year project will support community partners to research and explore museum collections, and to work collaboratively with museum staff to produce displays, events and digital content.

In England, they were particularly popular in the 12th and 13th centuries, and drew their origins from classical literature such as the work of Pliny the Elder and a Greek text from the AD 300s called the\u00a0Physiologus.\nThe descriptions also provided symbolic and moral stories alongside explanations of the creatures. Alongside real animals such as lions, swans and bears, there are mythical animals such as the phoenix and basilisk.\nThe importance of the world as created by God is underscored in bestiaries. A common layout of the bestiary is to open with God creating the earth and the animals. Animals can be grouped in different ways in bestiaries, either by their moralisations detailed in their descriptions or by their physical descriptions. Although few people actually read bestiaries, many more would have recognised the animals, which were found on different types of objects, from sculpture and floor tiles to dress accessories. We can find some of these in the British Museum\u2019s medieval collection.\nPin topped with the head of a unicorn.\nThis tiny pin is made of bone and is topped with the head of a unicorn. It matches the medieval description of the animal, as a horse-like beast with a long, straight horn protruding from its head. As on other examples, the horn has a twisted spiral running along its length. This particular unicorn also has a tiny beard. It was found in the 19th century in Bucklersbury, a road in the City of London nearby to Cheapside.\nPliny the Elder described the unicorn as, \u2018the fiercest animal, and it is said that it is impossible to catch one alive.\u2019 The only way to catch one would be to tame it by bringing it into contact with a virgin woman. The unicorn would then lie down and fall asleep on the lap of the maiden, whereby it could be killed or caught. In popular depictions of unicorns they will be in this position, asleep or resting with a spear plunged into them or with a hunter approaching. The end of this casket, which is on display in Room 40, shows this moment of capture and death.\nIvory casket featuring the death of a unicorn. Made in Paris, c. 1325\u20131350.\nThe story of the unicorn was an allegory of Christ\u2019s incarnation and it is suggested that the horn of the unicorn represents the unity of Christ and the Holy Father. The horn was recommended as a cure for poison and the horn had purifying properties.\nA beast which was not associated with purity was the centaur, half man and half animal, the upper body being the human part and the lower portion that of a horse-like creature. The centaur was a symbolic beast, as his human front concealed that he was also an animal. It is governed by its animal (rather than its Christian, human) self and as a result its image was tied to lust and sin.\nMetope from the Parthenon showing a Centaur and Lapith fighting. Athens, 447\u2013438 BC.\nThe unbridled passion of the centaur was illustrated by the battle of the Lapiths and the Centaurs at the wedding of Pirithous and Hippodamia in Greek mythology. As well as featuring on a metope of the Parthenon, this violent event was portrayed on a marble relief designed by , made around 1492. Centaurs also accompany sirens in some depictions, half women half birds, who were also associated with ideas of lust.\nA more courtly centaur is depicted on this 13th-century German candlestick. His hind quarters are that of a horse, his two back feet take the form of hooves, and a hole in his back would have held the candle. Oddly, he appears to have human feet at the front. Although his right foot is damaged, on his left is clearly a tapered shoe with gathered bands at the ankle. He wears a tunic on his torso and a hood which terminates in a point on both sides. In his left hand he holds a stringed instrument called a rebec. Another example of a hooded centaur playing music can be found on this wooden carving on a misericord from the choir stalls of New College, Oxford\u00a0\u2013 a clothed centaur plays a pipe and bangs a tabor.\nThe griffin, with the head and wings of an eagle and the body of a lion, was popular in heraldry and is frequently incorporated into coats of arms depicted with one foot or claw raised. It stands in this way on a bookbinder\u2019s stamp from about 1150\u20131200.\nA griffin on a bookbinder\u2019s stamp. Possibly French, c. 1150\u20131200.\nThe stamp would have been used to press into the leather binding which covered the wooden boards which formed a book cover. Measuring just under 3cm in length, the details of the beast are crisply delineated, down to its minute feathers. One famous description of a Griffin is to be found in Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy. In the book Purgatory, Dante witnesses a griffin pulling a chariot and describes the scene thus, \u2018back to the wheels the ladies then returned; and though the griffin moved the blessed burden, when he did that, none of his feathers stirred.\u2019\nCollections of legends telling the exploits of Alexander the Great, first written in the 4th century, known as The Alexander Romances, tell of Alexander carried up to the heavens in a chariot pulled by griffins. You can find depictions of this story in England on a number of misericords at Wells, Gloucester and Lincoln Cathedral. Griffins are also depicted fighting other animals such as lions. Writing in the 7th century, Isidore of Seville said that griffins are hostile to both humans and horses. As a combination of both lion and eagle, two regal animals of their own kind, griffins have associations with royalty.\nYou can find some of these fantastic beasts in the Sir Paul and Lady Ruddock Gallery of Medieval Europe 1050\u20131500 (Room 40), including a stone capital carved with a lion and a griffin\u00a0and the casket engraved with the capture of a unicorn."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/a-new-dimension-in-home-shopping/", "category": "News", "title": "A new dimension in home shopping", "author": "Daniel Pett, Senior Digital Humanities Manager", "timestamp": "2017-07-31 00:00:00", "text": "Over the last four years, the British Museum has been producing 3D models that can be viewed by anyone online. The roots of this work can be traced back to the Arts and Humanities Research Council\u2018s funding of the\u00a0MicroPasts crowdsourcing project with University College London, which produced 3D objects for academic research. The Museum continued its 3D output by using native mobile phone applications to publish a selection of\u00a0objects\u00a0on the Sketchfab platform, with many available to download under a Creative Commons Non-Commercial licence.\nA selection of the Lewis chessmen.\nAll of this work was based around the principles of Open Science and the premise of being cheap, quick and easy to replicate for anyone. We used a technique called photogrammetry\u00a0(multiple photographs taken in a strategic pattern around the object) and the resulting output was rendered in 3D software. Ideally anyone, an individual or institution, should be able to replicate our methods to create 3D representations of archaeology or artworks.\nMany have questioned the worth of these 3D models \u2013\u00a0what value do they add? My answer is that they are a natural extension of museum object documentation. There is a clear progression from line drawing to photography, and now to 3D representations which can be audio described, annotated, reused and embedded. There is also the potential for them to be monetised, which could potentially create a valuable income stream to fund some of the Museum\u2019s work.\nWe have identified and tested several paths, including Virtual Reality (VR) experiences, working with the gaming and other creative industries. However, one of \u00a0the most exciting ones was working in partnership with the British Museum Company \u2013 the Museum\u2019s commercial arm.\nSome of the models used in Room 3 displays.\nTogether we discussed the concept and process of creating facsimiles for sale in the British Museum shops, both online and on site. We had previously worked with Oxfordshire-based 3D company ThinkSee3D, who had provided replicas for our successful Asahi Shimbun Displays\u00a0Creating an ancestor: the Jericho Skull, Containing the divine: a sculpture of the Pacific god A\u2019a and Moving stories: three journeys.

They were produced directly from models created in-house and drawn from the collection of models on Sketchfab.\nAntinous\nIt quickly became apparent that printing models in plastics would not be very environmentally friendly and that gypsum prints would be too costly, so we decided to use a method of casting directly from a mould derived from a 3D model.\nA statue of Roy, High Priest of Amun.\nThinkSee3D have now developed a range of products for sale, starting with the Statue of Roy, Priest of Amun\u00a0and Antinous (shown above as 3D captures from which the moulds were created).

The print itself is the most reproduced image in the world \u2013 appearing on everything from pencils to coffee mugs, and street art to drums.\u00a0 And the wave is reused endlessly, to illustrate our vulnerability to the power of nature (and nature\u2019s vulnerability to us), the storms of the global political economy, and the whims of politicians. It has even been made into an emoji.\nBut not everyone sees or remembers the other elements in the print \u2013 the mountain in the distance and the three boats tucked between the waves. And not many people outside Japan know the name of the artist (although possibly more do now thanks to the Museum\u2019s current exhibition!).\nKatsushika Hokusai (1760\u20131849), Under the wave off Kanagawa (The Great Wave) from Thirty-six views of Mt Fuji. Colour woodblock, 1831. Acquired with Art Fund support.\nKatsushika Hokusai (1760\u20131849) was 71 when the print was first published. A few years later, though, he claimed that nothing he did before he was 70 was worth much, and it was only at the age of 73 that he had begun to understand the true form of things. Part of this was advertising, of course. He wanted you to believe what he was doing at that moment was his best work yet. And he wanted you to keep buying his work: at 110, he promised \u2018each dot and each line will come alive\u2019.\nAt the end of this book\u2019s first volume, aged 75, Hokusai uses a new name, \u2018Old Man Crazy to Paint\u2019, and a new seal, incorporating the outline of Fuji. He also sets out his artistic ambitions for the next 45 years. Katsushika Hokusai, One Hundred Views of Mt Fuji. Illustrated book, first of three volumes, 1834.\nHe only made it to 90. But he kept on drawing and painting to the end. And he made good on his promise. The extraordinary results are currently on display at the Museum in the exhibition Hokusai: beyond the Great Wave. We want you to go beyond the Great Wave, which comes early in the exhibition, and to explore the magnificent worlds that Hokusai conjured in deep old age.\nWe do keep coming back to it, though. It\u2019s the Great Wave that headlines the exhibition. And it\u2019s the Great Wave that seems to draw the crowds and to compel the critics.\nThere are good reasons for this, of course. Hokusai\u2019s work reached the west around 1860. Almost immediately, his manga (meaning \u2018random pictures\u2019) were seized on by the Impressionists, among others, liberating them from existing assumptions about how to draw and paint. It\u2019s not too much to claim that modern art probably begins with Hokusai.\nTwo decades later, the ocean was on western minds. The powers were using their ironclad fleets to expand their empires, not least across the Pacific. The Great Wave quickly came to symbolise the turbulence of the arts, as they strove to come to terms with the dislocations of industry and empire, appearing in Van Gogh\u2019s Starry Night and illustrating the sheet music for Debussy\u2019s La Mer.\nClaude Debussy, La Mer. Orchestral score, published by A Durand, 1905.\nAnd it has gone on to sweep the world. Again, there are good reasons. The print is a miracle of graphic compression and imagination. Hokusai has reduced the world to three elements: churning ocean, still, small mountain, and lowering sky. He has also revealed our place in it \u2013\u00a0the need to bend to the task, however dwarfed by nature, however uncertain the outcome.\nBut our preoccupation with this one print also suggests a problem. When we look at art, we tend to see what we want. And we usually want a story that leads to us. In Japan, Hokusai is best known not for the Great Wave, but for the print known as\u00a0Red Fuji \u2013 though the earliest impressions seem to have been pink. As the west turned to the oceans, so Japan had to find the internal resources and a national symbol with which to confront the threat.\nKatsushika Hokusai, Clear day with a southern breeze (Red Fuji). Colour woodblock print, 1831.\nIn the west, the first instinct is to reduce the Great Wave \u2013 and Hokusai \u2013 to its influence on western art. We think we know that the west led the way into the modern world. We are confident that the way in which we look at western art is the right way to look at art in general, and so we write Hokusai into the story of art on our terms, without questioning our assumptions.\nIt turns out, too, that Hokusai had studied western art \u2013 specifically, the way in which perspective drawing creates the illusion of depth \u2013 and that he incorporated these lessons into the Great Wave. Knowing this, we might be tempted to reduce the Great Wave still further, to a Japanese variation on a dominant western theme.\nHere, though, is where we go wrong. Perspective was only one of many techniques that Hokusai had mastered in the first 60 years of his life and that he drew on in the last 30.\u00a0 More importantly, he was not interested in the preoccupations of western art \u2013 how to depict the world realistically \u2013 and he had no need to challenge the conventions for doing so. Rather, he wanted to bring the world to life. He wanted to explore the tension between the churning sea and the eternal mountain, between the seen world that surrounds us and the unseen forces by which it is animated. He was not interested in establishing a distance between viewer and viewed, so that the world might be represented accurately, but in enabling communion, allowing us to see our way to the heart of things.\nLook a bit harder, and Hokusai has much more to say. The Great Wave is not the greatest of Hokusai\u2019s waves. He painted those up in the mountains, in his mid 80s, as the ceiling panels for a festival cart. You can find them toward the end of the exhibition. And they provide a fitting portal into the sublime paintings of his last three years, in the final room. Stamped with a seal announcing his determination to reach 100, they demonstrate how Hokusai could move effortlessly between seen and unseen worlds \u2013 even if we might want to keep the two apart. At 88, he shows us what it means to be a duck, floating on and ducking beneath the water, but also how a 12th-century warrior was able to fell a mythical monster.\nAged 90, in the last few months of his life, he captures the burden, but also the freedom, that comes with deep old age. The most magnificent of Hokusai\u2019s dragons \u2013 old, tired, but persistent \u2013 coils up out of the storm, bringing the rain that brings the world to life. A tiger pads effortlessly through the snow, gazing heavenwards, seeming to smile.\nKatsushika Hokusai, Tiger in the snow. Hanging scroll, ink and colour on silk, 1849. Private collection, USA.\nIt\u2019s easy enough to see only what we want. But there\u2019s always more to see with Hokusai. It\u2019s worth coming back and taking another look.\nHokusai: beyond the Great Wave\u00a0is on display at the Museum from 25 May to 13 August 2017, supported by Mitsubishi Corporation.\nTickets for the exhibition have sold out.

It is a bleak, waterless spot but offers multiple harbours and is ideally suited to commanding trade with the Western Indian Ocean and Red Sea and is a vital entrep\u00f4t for the Yemeni interior.\nIts origins and early history are vague but it probably existed as early as the 1st century AD and was described by the great 14th\u2013century author Ibn Battuta. On 19 January 1839, it was captured by the British and until 1967 remained an important British port, firstly run by the East India Company and then as a colony. 19th\u2013century British Political Residents of Yemen often wrote to the British Museum about new discoveries of ancient South Arabian antiquities in the interior and began collecting them on behalf of the Museum. One of these officers was Sir Robert Lambert Playfair (1828\u20131899) who discovered a series of old rock-cut reservoirs: popularly known as \u2018the Queen of Sheba\u2019s water tanks\u2019, which after being cleaned out, became a popular destination for day-trippers and were one of the most commonly photographed sights in Aden.\nSteamer Point, Aden.

The sheer quantity means that they are an important visual record. These were aimed principally at British servicemen and passing steamship passengers and show different sides of life here: the bustling downtown bazaars of Crater, the hotels and shops at Steamer Point and the almost brutal functionality of a modern port with piles of coal beside the piers and lighters bringing passengers ashore from the steamships anchored in the bay. The heavy military presence is implicit in the predominance of barracks and telecommunications infrastructure in the photographs yet there are no soldiers in these views and people are generally scarce because photographers using cameras with slow shutter speeds tried to minimise the risk of blurred figures.\nBritannia Hotel, Steamer Point.

There, I found a minty green sewing machine, collecting mud and dirt as it sat on the pavement along the road, waiting for buyers. The machine tells a rich and complex story about Egypt\u2019s modernity and transformation during the middle decades of the 20th century. The Museum\u2019s modern Egypt project is helping to recover such stories and histories which otherwise would be neglected and remain untold, particularly within the context of museums.\nThe Nefertiti sewing machine, around 1960.\nThe Nefertiti sewing machine was manufactured in the 1950s and 60s in Egypt by the country\u2019s military factories. Following the 1952 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, the factories expanded their scope of work in the early 50s to include household items. Within the framework of nationalist modernisation politics and the desire to increase national production, the machine was created to provide jobless women with a means for improving their income. The sleek design, the colour choice and the iconography of Nefertiti\u00a0were all meant to appeal to a wide demographic of aspiring Egyptians seeking class mobility and modern lifestyles. Reference to ancient Egyptian icons and figures in the naming of modern machinery was common during the period. For example, an Egyptian-manufactured car, produced between 1960 and 1972, was named Ramsis. The Nefertiti sewing machine became ubiquitous, yet it was not as successful as its makers intended. Today, the machine is a reminder of a top-down modernising project by the state in postcolonial Egypt.\nA notable feature of the Nefertiti machine is the hand-painted calligraphy. The development of Arabic calligraphy in 20th-century Egypt is tremendously significant, yet rarely studied. What happened to Arabic script in the Middle East\u2019s most populous country as modernity introduced new objects into everyday life? How did local and international products designed for mass consumption utilise the script on objects and in advertising? And how did the state confront the problem of illiteracy during this time? With the project, we hope to start to answer some of these questions.\nA small display of ten objects acquired in the first months of the project is now on view in the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery (Room 4), next to the Rosetta Stone. The objects \u2013 including periodicals, photography, one of the oldest Arabic language typewriters, and an ornate personalised picture frame \u2013\u00a0all provide snapshots into the history of writing, typographic development and literacy in 20th-century Egypt. Some of these themes resonate with the Rosetta Stone itself \u2013 its carved ancient scripts embody the 19th-century story of decipherment.\nObjects from the project on display in Room 4.\nThe objects on display illustrate how the project can expand the Museum\u2019s collection to include recent artefacts that tell stories about the modern and contemporary worlds.\nOne of the objects in the display is a framed portrait of a man whose name and the date of the photograph (1932) are inscribed with seashells within an elaborate wooden frame, referencing the rich history of Islamic architecture and design in Egypt. The pictured man is an efendi, a new social category of men that emerged in the beginning of the 20th century. The efendiyya, as a social group, emerged from the expansion of education and the increased awareness of national identity and Egyptian conceptions of modernity. They were bureaucrats, teachers and accountants.\nArabesque picture frame for\u00a0efendi\u00a0Ahmed Mohamed Chahine, dated 1932.\nIn this particular object, we see a personification of this \u2018new\u2019 Egyptian man, dressed in the suit and fez. He is an embodiment of a balancing act between Egyptian modernity and authenticity. The custom-made inlaid frame bears the name of the efendi pictured, \u2018Ahmed Mohamed Chahine.\u2019 Studio photography was already widely popular by the early 20th century. The intricately designed frame with art deco and arabesque elements adds to the overall self-representation of the efendi as a modern subject. This object shows us the impact of increased education to combat illiteracy in Egypt, the production of a new type of Egyptian, and the efforts to utilise Arabic script to personalise and mark the modern identity of this figure.\nA selection of objects on display in Room 4.\nThroughout the 20th century the Egyptian state made efforts to expand education and combat illiteracy. Two objects in the current display shed light on a chapter of this history. A red-and-white transistor radio, manufactured in Egypt in the 1950s, was part of the state\u2019s attempts to make this technology available to a wider audience. The radio was instrumental not only for the dissemination of news and information, as well as propaganda, but it also allowed for educational programming to combat illiteracy. A mounted photograph dated 1969 depicts this close relationship between radio and literacy programming by the government at the time.\nThe project is an exciting initiative to expand the ways in which the modern world is collected and displayed, particularly in a location such as the British Museum, which has long been associated with the rich ancient history of Egypt. The current small display shows some of the types of objects that can tell rich and complex stories seldom presented in the context of museums \u2013 not only in the UK, but also around the world.\nYou can find out more about the Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan\u2019s work here."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/inheriting-the-most-iconic-object-at-the-british-museum/", "category": "Curator's corner", "title": "Inheriting the most iconic object at the British Museum", "author": "Ilona Regulski, Curator: Egyptian Written Culture", "timestamp": "2017-07-15 00:00:00", "text": "For any student of Egyptology, the Rosetta Stone has to be the most extraordinary icon in your chosen field.

The sheer excitement of reading a text for the first time is what drives every philologist and if you are lucky, you will now start to decipher texts yourself. Let\u2019s be honest, every language specialist wants to be a Champollion, deciphering a previously untranslated ancient text!\nHieroglyph hunters: Thomas Young and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion.\nWhen I joined the British Museum as Curator of Egyptian Written Culture, the Rosetta Stone came under my care. I didn\u2019t think this would be a challenging task. After all, we have already discovered everything there is to know about the Rosetta Stone, right? Well, no, not really! Let me share with you a few facts I have learnt since I \u2018inherited\u2019 the Rosetta Stone from my predecessor.\nThe Rosetta Stone is itself a copy of an older document\nThe Rosetta Stone. Today, a unique object in Egyptology, but originally one of many identical stelae that were mass produced.\nAccording to the inscription on the Stone, an identical copy of the declaration was to be placed in every sizeable temple across Egypt. Whether this happened is unknown, but copies of the same bilingual, three-script decree have now been found and can be seen in other museums. The Rosetta Stone is thus one of many mass-produced stelae designed to widely disseminate an agreement issued by a council of priests in 196 BC. In fact, the text on the Stone is a copy of a prototype that was composed about a century earlier in the 3rd century BC. Only the date and the names were changed!\nThe Rosetta Stone was not originally an Egyptian text\nDecrees of this kind were essentially honorary Greek texts in composition, terminology, and ideology. The active priestly involvement in state affairs and the near exclusion of the Ptolemaic rulers from important religious decisions conveyed in the text is not very \u2018Egyptian\u2019 \u2013 in ancient Egypt, such decrees would have been issued by the pharaoh. By the time of the Rosetta Stone inscription, Egyptian priests were capable of composing Egyptian as well as Greek official texts, as they now belonged to the ruling class of the Ptolemaic administration.\nExperts inspecting the Rosetta Stone during the International Congress of Orientalists of 1874. Published in\u00a0Illustrated London News.\nPriests made an effort to make the hieroglyphic text look old!\nAt the time the Rosetta Stone text was inscribed, the use of hieroglyphs was disappearing. As the Stone tells us, hieroglyphs were \u2018sacred writing\u2019 or \u2018the writing of the words of the gods\u2019. Distinguishing this script from the day-to-day script and language of Egypt (Demotic and Ancient Greek) was a way for the priests to display their knowledge and, therefore, their special status. When translating the text into hieroglyphs, they tried to make them \u2018look old\u2019 in comparison with Demotic. Rather than using the ancient equivalent for a Demotic word, they searched for synonyms. For example, instead of translating the Greek \u03c8\u03ae\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 \u2018decree\u2019 with the commonly used wD, they chose to use\u00a0sxAw \u2018memorandum\u2019 because wD is too close to wt in Demotic.\nCan\u2019t get enough of the Rosetta Stone?

But what is it?\nThe Rosetta Stone and a reconstruction of how it would have originally looked. Illustration by Claire Thorne.\nThe Stone is a broken part of a bigger stone slab. It has a message carved into it, written in three types of writing (called scripts). It was an important clue that helped experts learn to read Egyptian hieroglyphs (a writing system that used pictures as signs).\nWhy is it important?\nThe writing on the Stone is an official message, called a decree, about the king (Ptolemy V, r. 204\u2013181 BC). The decree was copied on to large stone slabs called stelae, which were put in every temple in Egypt. It says that the priests of a temple in Memphis (in Egypt) supported the king. The Rosetta Stone is one of these copies, so not particularly important in its own right.\nThe important thing for us is that the decree is inscribed three times, in hieroglyphs (suitable for a priestly decree), Demotic (the native Egyptian script used for daily purposes, meaning \u2018language of the people\u2019), and Ancient Greek (the language of the administration \u2013 the rulers of Egypt at this point were Greco-Macedonian after Alexander the Great\u2019s conquest).\nThe Rosetta Stone was found broken and incomplete. It features 14 lines of hieroglyphic script:\nDetail of the hieroglyphs, including a cartouche featuring the name Ptolemy (written right to left, along with an Egyptian honorific).\n32 lines in Demotic:\nDetail of the Demotic section of the text.\nand 53 lines of Ancient Greek:\nDetail of the Ancient Greek section. You can make out the name Ptolemy as \u03a0\u03a4\u039f\u039b\u0395\u039c\u0391\u0399\u039f\u03a3.\nThe importance of this to Egyptology is immense. When it was discovered, nobody knew how to read ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. Because the inscriptions say the same thing in three different scripts, and scholars could still read Ancient Greek, the Rosetta Stone became a valuable key to deciphering the hieroglyphs.\nWhen was it found?\nNapoleon Bonaparte\u00a0campaigned in Egypt from 1798 to 1801, with the intention of dominating the East Mediterranean and threatening the British hold on India. Although accounts of the Stone\u2019s discovery in July 1799 are now rather vague, the story most generally accepted is that it was found by accident by soldiers in Napoleon\u2019s army. They discovered the Rosetta Stone on 15 July 1799 while digging the foundations of an addition to a fort near the town of Rashid (Rosetta) in the Nile Delta. It had apparently been built into a very old wall. The officer in charge, Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Bouchard (1771\u20131822), realised the importance of the discovery.\nThe city of Rosetta around the time the Rosetta Stone was found. Hand-coloured aquatint etching by Thomas Milton (after Luigi Mayer), 1801\u20131803.\nOn Napoleon\u2019s defeat, the stone became the property of the\u00a0British under the terms of the Treaty of Alexandria (1801) along with other antiquities that the French had found. The stone was shipped to England and arrived in Portsmouth in February 1802.\nWho cracked the code?\nSoon after the end of the 4th century AD, when hieroglyphs had gone out of use, the knowledge of how to read and write them disappeared. In the early years of the 19th century, scholars were able to use the Greek inscription on this stone as the key to decipher them.\u00a0Thomas Young\u00a0(1773\u20131829), an English physicist, was the first to show that some of the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta Stone wrote the sounds of a royal name, that of Ptolemy.\nA letter from Thomas Young about hieroglyphs, written on 10 February 1818. The meanings he suggests for these groups are mostly correct, but he was unable to analyse how the signs conveyed their meaning, and they are little more than highly educated guesses!\nThe French scholar\u00a0Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion (1790\u20131832) then realised that hieroglyphs recorded the sound of the Egyptian language. This laid the foundations of our knowledge of ancient Egyptian language and culture. Champollion made a crucial step in understanding ancient Egyptian writing when he pieced together the hieroglyphs that were used to write the names of non-Egyptian rulers. He announced his discovery, which had been based on analysis of the Rosetta Stone and other texts, in a paper at the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres at Paris on Friday 27 September 1822. The audience included his English rival Thomas Young, who was also trying to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs.\nChampollion\u2019s hieroglyphic hand.\nChampollion inscribed this copy of the published paper with alphabetic hieroglyphs meaning \u2018\u00e0 mon ami Dubois\u2019 (\u2018to my friend Dubois\u2019). Champollion made a second crucial breakthrough in 1824, realising that the alphabetic signs were used not only for foreign names, but also for the Egyptian language and names. Together with his knowledge of the\u00a0Coptic language, which derived from ancient Egyptian, this allowed him to begin reading hieroglyphic inscriptions fully.\nWhat does the inscription actually say?\nThe inscription on the Rosetta Stone is a decree passed by a council of priests. It is one of a series that affirm the royal cult of the 13-year-old\u00a0Ptolemy V\u00a0on the first anniversary of his coronation (in 196 BC). You can read the full translation here.\nAccording to the inscription on the Stone, an identical copy of the declaration was to be placed in every sizeable temple across Egypt. Whether this happened is unknown, but copies of the same bilingual, three-script decree have now been found and can be seen in other museums. The Rosetta Stone is thus one of many mass-produced stelae designed to widely disseminate an agreement issued by a council of priests in 196 BC. In fact, the text on the Stone is a copy of a prototype that was composed about a century earlier in the 3rd century BC. Only the date and the names were changed!\nWhere is it now?\nAfter the Stone was shipped to England in February 1802, it was presented to the British Museum by George III in July of that year. The Rosetta Stone and other sculptures were placed in temporary structures in the Museum grounds because the floors were not strong enough to bear their weight! After a plea to Parliament for funds, the Trustees began building a new gallery to house these acquisitions.\nThe Rosetta Stone on display in Room 4.\nThe Rosetta Stone has been on display in the British Museum since 1802, with only one break. Towards the end of the First World War, in 1917, when the Museum was concerned about heavy bombing in London, they moved it to safety along with other, portable, \u2018important\u2019 objects. The iconic object spent the next two years in a station on the Postal Tube Railway\u00a050 feet below the ground at Holborn.\nToday, you can see the Rosetta Stone in Room 4 (the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery), and remotely\u00a0visit it on Google Street View. You can touch a replica of it in Room 1 (the Enlightenment Gallery).

All rights reserved. HBO\u00ae and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.\nGeorge R R Martin has written\u00a0that he based the Dothraki on an \u2018amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures\u2026 seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy.\u2019 There are certainly close parallels with the Mongols and the Huns. Some fans have already pointed out\u00a0that Khal Drogo can be compared to Genghis Khan or Attila the Hun \u2013 great leaders who shared the ambition of uniting many nomadic tribes. But what about the people that came before the Mongols and the Huns? There are several similarities with another steppe culture \u2013 the Scythians, who may also have inspired the Dothraki.\nWho were the Scythians? Well, they were fearsome, nomadic warriors who loved their horses \u2013 sound familiar? In many ways, they set the template for the Huns, Mongols and other nomads of the steppe as they were around first, flourishing from about 900 to 200 BC. Here are a few ways in which the terrifying Dothraki take their lead from the equally terrifying Scythians.\nYou win or you die\nDothraki warriors, thankfully not about to kill you.\u00a0\u00a9 2016 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO\u00ae and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.\nThe Dothraki in Game of Thrones are represented as feared and ferocious warriors. Jorah Mormont describes their culture as one that values power and follows strength above all, and there is no greater way to demonstrate power and strength according to the Dothraki than through war. Like their fictional counterparts, the Scythians were pretty terrifying in battle. The Greek historian Herodotus writes that Scythians drank the blood of the men they killed and kept their scalps as trophies and skulls as drinking cups. While we should probably take Herodotus with a pinch of salt, by all accounts they were pretty brutal! The Dothraki also like decapitating their defeated enemies \u2013 guards known as the\u00a0jaqqa rhan, or mercy men, use heavy axes to do this.\nThe Scythians and the Dothraki fight on horseback and are excellent archers. They both use curved (or composite) bows to maximise the range and the damage of their arrows. As Jorah Mormont says of the Dothraki, \u2018they are better riders than any knight, utterly fearless, and their bows outrange ours.\u2019\nGold sew-on clothing appliqu\u00e9\u00a0in the form of two Scythian archers.\nPart of their fearsome reputation comes from the perception among outsiders that the Dothraki and the Scythians are barbarians \u2013 Daenerys\u2019 brother, who comes to a rather unpleasant end (in fact based on this totally real practice), regularly criticises Dothraki culture as being \u2018savage\u2019. Similarly the ancient Greeks perceived the Scythians as both terrifying and barbarous, while at the same time holding some respect for their brutal ways.\nWho wears the trousers?\nDothraki travel light and have light armour.\u00a0\u00a9 2016 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO\u00ae and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.\nThe visual representation of the Dothraki in the TV series owes much more to other cultures than the Scythians but there are still some interesting links. Men wore their hair long: the Dothraki men cut their long hair when they have been defeated, the Scythians cut theirs as part of a ceremony for the death of a king. They also both typically wear lightweight protection instead of heavy armour in battle to make them more agile. Interestingly, they both wore trousers, marking them out from other groups. However, vast stretches of where the Scythians lived can be extremely cold, so they were unlikely to be wearing as few clothes as Khal Drogo.\nThis gold bowl shows Scythians with long hair and trousers. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017. Photo: V Terebenin.\nSocial structure\nThe Scythians were not a united people but made up of a number of tribes with their own kings or chiefs. The Dothraki, too, are divided into several clans known as khalasars, led by a single leader, the khal.\nKhal Drogo.\u00a0\u00a9 2016 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO\u00ae and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.\nThe Scythian tribes did occasionally come together \u2013 Herodotus mentions tribes gathering for the funeral of a great king. The Dothraki also come together in their only city, Vaes Dothrak, for special religious ceremonies.\nWarrior women?\nThe role of women seems to be a point of difference between the two cultures. Dothraki women have limited role in society with little to no individual freedom. Even high status women \u2013 the widows of khals\u00a0\u2013 are sent to live out their days together in a temple compound away from their tribes. Dothraki women symbolically reject warfare when they ceremonially refuse the wedding gifts of a bow, whip and curved blade \u2013 and give these gifts to their husbands. In contrast, Scythian weapons have been uncovered in female as well as male graves, and females have been found as if dressed for battle, suggesting that women were involved in warfare. Many experts think that Scythian women may have inspired the myth of the Amazons, the tribes of female warriors that so worried the Greeks.\nDaenerys as khaleesi. \u00a9 2016 Home Box Office, Inc.

HBO\u00ae and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.\nOne example of a strong \u2018Dothraki\u2019 woman is the cult of leadership that develops around Daenerys. Although not technically Dothraki herself, she becomes the wife of a khal and her ambition, strength and leadership skills (as well as her amazing ability to walk through fire completely unscathed) lead the Dothraki to follow and even worship her. She also isn\u2019t afraid to get involved in the fighting herself and the new pictures from season 7 seem to suggest that she will be riding into battle on her dragons. She certainly makes for a pretty awesome warrior queen \u2013 even by the standards of the Amazons.\nAlways on the move\nSpot the difference: the Dothraki Sea and the Scythian steppe.

In the books they are described as inhabiting a massive area of grassland in central Essos called the \u2018Dothraki Sea\u2019, very similar to the grassy steppe of Central Asia and Siberia where the Scythians lived. Both habitats are vast oceans of grassland, making it a harsh environment in which to settle down permanently. The Scythians travelled in search of resources, including fresh pasture for their horses.\nThe Dothraki are nomads, like the Scythians, and lived in these tents. \u00a9 2016 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO\u00ae and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.\nNeither culture practised agriculture \u2013 the Dothraki even see it as sinful to cut the flesh of mother earth \u2013 and the Scythians traded to get the things that they couldn\u2019t produce themselves. Both cultures stayed in tents and had portable belongings that could be packed up on horseback. The Dothraki tents in the Game of Thrones series are similar to the large felt-covered tents used by the Scythians.\nHorses, horses and MORE HORSES!\nGold plaque of a mounted Scythian. Black Sea region, c. 400\u2013350 BC. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017. Photo: V Terebenin.\nHorses are at the heart of Dothraki culture. They rely on their horses for food, transportation and battle, and worship a horse deity, the Great Stallion. In fact, the Dothraki are said to be born, fight and die in the saddle. In their language \u2018Dothraki\u2019 literally translates as \u2018riders\u2019. Riding is also essential to social status \u2013 the Dothraki can abandon a leader who is too sick to ride, as we see with poor Khal Drogo. This reverence for horses is very likely inspired by the Scythians and similar nomadic cultures, as their lifestyle heavily depended on them.\nThe Scythians were excellent horsemen and developed horse breeding to a new level. Horse remains uncovered by archaeologists show that prized horses were incredibly well cared for, living for 15 to 20 years. They also used horses for sustenance and like the Dothraki ate a diet of horse meat, washed down with fermented mares\u2019 milk.\nAn artist\u2019s impression of a Scythian on a horse (reconstruction by D V Pozdnjakov) and Dothraki Khal Drogo.\u00a0\u00a9 2016 Home Box Office, Inc.

Excavated Scythian tombs have revealed amazingly preserved horses, which have been dressed for the afterlife with elaborate headgear and saddles. This is closely paralleled by the Dothraki custom of slaughtering a warrior\u2019s horse when he dies, placing it alongside the body of their rider on the funeral pyre.\nIn Game of Thrones we also see horses slaughtered as a sacrifice to the horse god. Who can forget poor Daenerys having to eat that heart from a freshly killed horse as part of a divination ritual? Horse sacrifice for ritual purposes also took place in Scythian culture. The Greek writer Herodotus says that the Scythians strangled and flayed horses before boiling the meat and offering a portion of the meat and entrails to the gods.\nDaenerys eats a horse\u2019s heart.\u00a0\u00a9 2016 Home Box Office, Inc.

For many, we are the place you visit in your first or second day in the country, where you look to have the links explained between your culture and others, where the great and small objects of human endeavor are displayed. Helping to shape our collective understanding of the human experience, that is our global mission.\nWe continue to play our role as the world\u2019s most generous lender of artefacts, by helping to show over 2,200 objects in 113 museums and galleries across the world in the past year. The hugely successful touring exhibition, A History of the World in 100 objects, has now been seen by over 1.4 million people worldwide and produced record-breaking visitor numbers in Canberra (178,220), and the National Museum of China in Beijing (340,645).\nEntrance to A History of the World in 100 Objects at the\u00a0National Museum of China in Beijing.\nThe Museum is also at the forefront of efforts to preserve cultural heritage; our Iraq Heritage Rescue Scheme (funded through the Cultural Protection Fund) is now in its second year. Exciting discoveries have been made at two sites, Tello (Ancient Girsu) in the south near Nasiriya, and in Darband-i Rania in Iraqi Kurdistan \u2013 more on these to come.

As a result of our partnerships, nine million people were able to see a British Museum object beyond Bloomsbury, bringing the wonder and experience of some of our most important artefacts into local communities. From Aberdeen to Wrexham, the Museum loaned nearly 3,000 objects to 156 venues in the UK in 2016\u201317.\nIn London our major exhibitions on Sicily, underwater archaeology in Egypt, South African art and American printmaking drew over 525,000 visitors. Access for students to engage and experience the unique collection through teaching resources, sessions and gallery visits is of central importance to the Museum, and has reached a nine-year high with the number of visits from UK schools totaling nearly 150,000.\nInside the BP exhibition Sunken cities: Egypt\u2019s lost worlds.\nResearch and scholarship have always been the bedrock of the Museum\u2019s activities. In the past five years the Museum has published over 900 books and scholarly articles.\u00a0 Last year we raised nearly \u00a34 million in external funding for research, which has fed into the Museum\u2019s current Hokusai exhibition; digital reconstruction work on the Jericho skull; and a project to transcribe and digitise the original catalogues from Sir Hans Sloane\u2019s collection.\nTurning to the future, in the coming year the Museum will open three major new or refurbished permanent galleries:\nThe Sir Joseph Hotung Gallery of China and South Asia will open in November, and will tell the story of China and South Asia up to the present day.\nThe Albukhary Foundation Galleries of the Islamic world will open in autumn 2018, and will demonstrate the global expansion of the faith from the advent of Islam to the present day.

We want a walk around our permanent collection to be a voyage of discovery and learning for all.\u00a0 This will involve a new narrative for the collections, an emphasis on the interconnectedness of cultures, the renovation of the building and improvement of facilities for our millions of visitors, and, of course, digital.

The Museum is a museum of the world, for the world, and since you are part of the world you\u2019ll find yourself here too, even if you\u2019re queer.\nThe Rainbow Flag waving in the wind at San Francisco\u2019s Castro District.

Image used through Wikimedia Commons.\nThe Rainbow Flag has been part of the LGBT movement since 1978, when, at the request of Harvey Milk (the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in the United States), activist and artist Gilbert Baker (1951\u20132017) designed it in his studio in San Francisco. When Milk said \u2018It\u2019s not about personal gain, it\u2019s not about ego, it\u2019s not about power, it\u2019s about giving those young people out there hope,\u2019 he led the way for every LGBT movement since. Baker went beyond Milk\u2019s challenge, describing his method with the words, \u2018A true flag cannot be designed \u2013 it has to be torn from the souls of the people.\u2019\nOriginally it was eight colours strong \u2013 pink and turquoise were dropped to make mass production easier \u2013 and each colour means something. Pink, now gone, meant sexuality. Red means life, orange means healing, yellow means sunlight. Green represents nature, turquoise art, blue harmony, and violet means spirit. With this mix of colours in a harmonious and natural form, it also signifies the togetherness of the LGBT community. It has been at every single Gay Pride march ever since, and has recently been projected onto some of the most famous buildings in the world.\nThe Rainbow Flag projected onto the White House when the Supreme Court ruled marriage equality to be guaranteed by the Constitution.

Over Pride in London weekend this year (7\u20139 July 2017) the British Museum will proudly fly the Rainbow Flag, for all its visitors to see, indeed for the whole world to see. The Museum and the flag have great symbolic significance and it is entirely fitting that they should come together this year, and hopefully for many years to come. What I said earlier about needing the Rainbow Flag a little earlier in my life basically meant I wish I had seen it somewhere to know I was not alone. The Museum can connect you to someone you never knew existed, and the Rainbow Flag can do just the same. Just as numismatists, archaeologists, Egyptologists and the generally curious can find like-minded people at the British Museum, a gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered or queer person can find solidarity with a fellow flag flyer. Just by seeing the flag and the Museum together, even for just a weekend, can have an enormously supportive effect on anyone, LGBTQ or straight, because it\u2019s about society accepting who you are and accepting who you love.\nGeorge Benson and the Museum\u2019s own Rainbow Flag.\nYou see, if I could tell my young gay self \u2013 who was bullied at school for being gay, who told his friends he fancied Posh Spice when he actually fancied David Beckham, who wanted nothing more than to fit in, who didn\u2019t come out to friends and family for years out of fear \u2013 that one heartwarming day the big ol\u2019 building full of stuff, at the heart of the establishment, would raise a Rainbow Flag atop its highest point, for all to see in the spirit of togetherness, tolerance, community and acceptance\u2026 well, I think my younger self would feel nothing but Pride, and a little less lonely too.\nHappy Pride everyone!\nThe free display Desire, love, identity: exploring LGBTQ histories is open in Room 69a until 15 October 2017, supported by Stephen and Julie Fitzgerald.

She identified herself with her people, making a\u00a0strength out of what was then considered a weakness: the fact that she was a woman. In a famously theatrical speech at Tilbury in 1588, when England was under threat from invasion by the Spanish Armada, she compared her own body to the body politic of England:\nI know I have the body but of a weak, feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king.\nThe same\u00a0message is promoted by a gold medal\u00a0designed by the painter and miniaturist Nicholas Hilliard, which commemorates the survival of England \u2013 a divided\u00a0and vulnerable Protestant nation \u2013 from the perceived threat posed by international Catholicism. On one side it shows the Queen three-quarter face,\u00a0with a Latin inscription that translates as \u2018No other circle in the world is more rich\u2019, promoting the strength and wealth of the English crown. On the back of the medal, a lone bay tree on an island in a stormy sea is labelled E R (Elizabeth Regina), \u2018Elizabeth, the Queen\u2019. The bay tree was thought to provide protection against lightning as the inscription explains: \u2018Not even danger affects it\u2019 \u2013 unlike the ship in the background, which is sinking after being struck by a bolt of lightning. This medal promotes Elizabeth as a political survivor; one who has lived through Catholic conspiracy at home and foreign invasion and was designed to be worn as a token of loyalty and allegiance. For a fine miniature by Nicholas Hilliard of Elizabeth\u2019s successor, James I, see the superb Lyte Jewel in the Waddesdon Bequest gallery 2A.\nNicholas Hilliard, gold medal of Elizabeth I \u2018Danger Averted\u2019. Cast and chased gold. London, c. 1580\u20131590.\nHer famous virginity was central to her image in so many portraits, not least in a famous gold medal, the Phoenix Jewel, in which she is compared with the phoenix who, according to legend, was consumed by flames and then rose out of its own ashes to live once more.\nNicholas Hilliard, The Phoenix Jewel. Gold medal of Elizabeth I cut out in silhouette in enamelled border. London, c. 1570\u20131580.\nThe rebirth of the phoenix came to\u00a0be associated\u00a0with chastity, the only virtue which it was thought a woman could truly attain. That imagery is at the heart \u2013 literally \u2013 of the famous \u2018Phoenix\u2019 portrait of\u00a0Elizabeth named after the jewel she wears on her breast. The emblem appears again on the Phoenix Jewel, in which the crowned monogram of the queen appears above the image of the graceful phoenix fluttering sensuously out of the flames. Unlike Dumbledore\u2019s pet, Fawkes, in the Harry Potter series, in Elizabethan England the phoenix was definitely female \u2013 an element of its unique rarity, beauty and distinction. There can only be one Queen of England \u2013\u00a0there can only be one phoenix. When Shakespeare wrote his enigmatic poem, The Phoenix and the Turtle around 1600, he presented the Queen as the Phoenix: \u2018Beauty, truth and rarity,/ Grace in all simplicity\u2019. Not that there is much simplicity in Elizabeth\u2019s presentation of herself on the front of the\u00a0Phoenix Jewel, which is emphatic and striking.\nHer profile is strongly silhouetted in a cut-out construction, superbly chased in the gold to pick out the details of\u00a0her dress: the rich pearls, jewels, ruff and silk velvets. An enamelled wreath of Tudor roses surrounds her, while the loop worked into the frame shows that this, too, was intended to be worn.\nAssociated with Nicholas Hilliard, Queen Elizabeth I. \u00a0Oil on panel, c. 1575.\u00a0\u00a9\u00a0National Portrait Gallery, London.\nElizabeth encouraged her portrait to be shown off as a luxury fashion accessory. A specialised court workshop produced miniature portraits as cameos, relief portraits cut into onyx and sardonyx stones. About 30 portraits of Elizabeth survive in this tiny format, a revived classical art form which allowed the engraver to play with the different-coloured layers in the stone. In ancient Rome, cameos celebrated the power of emperors and were given as political and diplomatic gifts. Renaissance rulers revived the practice in a self-conscious way.\nCameos could also be set into rings. The diarist John Evelyn tells us that Elizabeth\u2019s fame gave these rings value\u00a0long after her death, when he records that he saw the musician, Jerome Lanier, wearing one in 1654. Lanier had served as \u2018Musician in Ordinary\u2019 to Elizabeth from 1599, so he wore the ring in her memory. Along with rings, cameos were also set as pendants. We have a fine example in the Museum\u2019s collection where the cameo pendant is set in a gold frame made to look like a spoked wheel studded with rubies. The whiteness of the enamel sets off the whiteness of the Queen\u2019s skin on the cameo. Elizabeth was extremely proud of her pallor, priming her face with a foundation made of poisonous white lead and vinegar, so as to set off her almost black eyes and red hair.\nGold ring with onyx cameo portrait of Elizabeth I in profile. London, c.\u00a01575\u20131603.\nA third cameo, slightly larger than the other two, is the finest of the group in terms of the detail of Elizabeth\u2019s costume and the way in which the different coloured layers in the stone have been exploited to give a sense of depth, vivacity and modelling to her portrait.\nLeft: Gold enamelled pendant, set with rubies and an onyx cameo portrait of Elizabeth I in profile.

You might have been taught the basics, like how to put a condom on a banana. Perhaps you were shown a video of cartoon characters running around kissing. Or you might not have been taught it at all, in the hope that you might figure it out alone.\nToday, with sexual content now available online at the touch of a button, these methods seem hopelessly out of date. To help young people navigate the internet safely, the government is introducing compulsory SRE for all secondary schools from September 2019. SRE can equip young people to recognise the difference between healthy and unhealthy relationships.\nHandling a replica of the Ain Sakhri lovers figurine.\nBut where does the British Museum fit in to all this? Museums are social spaces where people can ask questions, create dialogues and make personal connections. Stepping out of a classroom into the more informal museum environment can be a way for students to explore topics through discussion and object-based enquiry. Objects are powerful tools for breaking down barriers, exploring meaning and starting conversations around sensitive topics. They provide a way to talk about topics in SRE in a historical context, removed from students asking teachers directly about their own sexual experiences.\nOur free SRE programme for secondary schools uses objects from throughout history as discussion points to explore themes such as body image, LGBTQ+, gender and transgender identities, pornography and consent. I co-developed the SRE programme with artist Chloe Cooper, and we use art-based activities to explore issues in a bit more depth.\nArtist educator Chloe Cooper with Achland Burghley School in front of the Queen of the Night relief.\nAll the workshops start by establishing a safe learning environment based on the principle that prejudice, discrimination and bullying are harmful and unacceptable. Students will hopefully leave the sessions feeling comfortable discussing SRE topics with their peers, parents and teachers \u2013 and feeling confident with their own identity. It also provides teachers with a pool of resources and discussions to take back to school.\nHere are five key objects we use in our SRE workshops:\nThe Ain Sakhri lovers figurine\nThe Ain Sakhri lovers figurine. The Levant, 10,000 BC.\nThis figurine is the oldest known representation of a couple making love in the world. It was found in a cave in the Judean desert. A pebble has been ingeniously carved so that, whichever way you look at it, the shape of the figurine is phallic but the genders of the couple are not revealed. We use this object as a starting point to discuss gender, relationships and sexual orientation.\nThe Queen of the Night relief\nThe Queen of the Night relief. Old Babylonian, 19th\u201318th centuries BC.\nWe use gods from across the collection to look at gender and transgender identities. This object is a 4,000-year-old Mesopotamian baked clay relief of the goddess Ishtar (or Ereskigal) who had the power to change women into men and men into women. We discuss the difference between biological sex, gender identity and gender expression and compare what we assume are \u2018female\u2019 and \u2018male\u2019 attributes in objects to challenge perceptions of gender norms.\nThe Warren Cup\nThe Warren Cup. Found near Jerusalem, 15 BC\u2013AD 15.\nThe Warren Cup provides evidence for physical intimacy in the Roman Empire, with scenes of two male couples having sex. To our eyes, images of a young man with a boy (probably aged between 14 and 16) are highly controversial \u2013 but Roman society considered the relationship acceptable. We use this object to challenge perceptions on assumed ideas of dominance and submission in relationships, the difference between sexual preference and sexual orientation, and the physicality of sexual pleasure.\nJapanese shunga\nKitagawa Utamaro (d. 1806), Lovers in private second floor room of tea-house from Utamakura (Poem of the Pillow). Shunga colour woodblock print, 1788.\nTeaching about pornography can be difficult. However, using a historical object from another culture can take the focus away from modern ideas, providing a starting point to discuss why people now and through history have watched, made and used pornographic imagery. Shunga \u2013 literally \u2018spring pictures\u2019 \u2013 are explicit and beautifully detailed erotic paintings, prints and books. Produced from around 1600 to 1900 (and banned in Japan for much of the 20th century), they inspired Toulouse-Lautrec, Rodin and Picasso. They appealed to all classes and to both men and women. We discuss the difference between fantasy and reality, what you can learn about sex from pornography and what you can\u2019t, communication, and consent as an active process.\nThe goddess Tara\nA gilded bronze figure of the Buddhist goddess Tara. Sri Lanka, c. 8th century AD.\nThis is the Buddhist goddess Tara, the consort of a bodhisattva (a deity who chose to relinquish enlightenment to help alleviate the suffering of humanity). Her narrow waist, rounded hips, full breasts, lips and large almond-shaped eyes all represent an ideal of feminine beauty. Yet, when this statue first came to the Museum in 1830, it was kept off display as she was considered too erotic. During the session we also look at bodies with penises to acknowledge anxieties of boys feeling inadequate compared to bodies seen in porn. We also discuss nakedness, pubic hair and what it means to be healthy.\nYou can find out more and book your class into one of these sessions\u00a0online."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/montagu-house-the-first-british-museum/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Montagu House: the first British Museum", "author": "Francesca Hillier, Museum Archivist", "timestamp": "2017-06-23 00:00:00", "text": "On 11 January 1753 Sir Hans Sloane died and left his collection to the nation. The Cotton Library, which included very important works such as the Lindisfarne Gospels, a manuscript of Beowulf and two of the four known copies of Magna Carta, had already been left to the state in 1700 by Sir Robert Bruce, Sir Thomas and Sir John Cotton. The Harley manuscript collection, purchased by the government for \u00a310,000, was also in need of a home. These three important collections were to be the founding collection of the British Museum.\nThe British Museum Act of 1753. The opening page of the Act that created the British Museum.\nOn 7 June 1753, the British Museum Act received royal assent. The first meeting of the Trustees of the newly founded British Museum was held on 11 December 1753, at the Cockpit, Whitehall, and their most pressing decision was to choose a suitable repository for this extensive collection.\nA number of possible properties were considered for this new national collection. A new building within the Palace of Westminster, at an estimated cost of \u00a350,000\u201360,000, was deemed too expensive and Buckingham House, later to become Buckingham Palace, was also dismissed as too costly, at \u00a330,000, and because of its inconvenient location.\nFinally, the long-neglected Montagu House in Bloomsbury was settled upon and in June 1754, the Articles of Agreement between the Duke of Montagu and others were signed by the Trustees and the Deed of Bargain and Sale of Montagu House was completed in April 1755.\nDeed of bargain and sale of Montagu House, dated\u00a05 April 1755.\nThe area where Montagu House was situated has an interesting history. It was known as Blemondsbury after William de Blemond, who took possession of the land in 1201. This later developed into \u2018Bloomsbury\u2019. After various changes in ownership, Henry VIII\u2019s Chancellor Thomas Wriothesley, later 1st Earl of Southampton, was gifted the land by the King and it remained in his family until 1667. Rachel, one of the 4th Earl\u2019s daughters, inherited the land, and after marrying William Russell (son of the\u00a0Earl (later 1st Duke) of Bedford), the area later came under the control of the Bedford family. Great Russell Street, Russell Square and Bedford Square, all near the Museum, are named after these families.\nOn 19 June 1675, William and Rachel Russell sold this part of their estate, known as Babers Field, to Ralph Montagu (to whom Rachel was related through his marriage to her half-sister) and this was where he subsequently chose to build Montagu House. Montagu had an interesting reputation (the author Jonathan Swift referred to him as an \u2018arrant knave\u2019) but he found favour with the King and was created a duke in 1705.\nRalph Montagu chose as architect Robert Hooke. Building began in 1677 but it was severely damaged by fire in 1686, less than 10 years after completion. It was rebuilt to a similar design and it is this second Montagu House that was to become the first home of the British Museum. It was a beautiful French-style house with an ornate interior decorative scheme, described in its day as one of the finest private houses in London.\nThe north front of Montagu House and Gardens.

Drawing by Samuel Hieronymus Grimm (1733\u20131794). Pen and grey ink and watercolour, heightened with white, 1780.\nOnce the Trustees had decided on Montagu House, they appointed Henry Keene as principal architect to oversee the work of transforming the house into a museum. The house had suffered badly from damp and much repair work was needed in order to fulfil the needs of the collection as well as the staff in residence who looked after it.\nGroups of visitors on the staircase of the old British Museum, Montagu House. Hand-coloured etching and aquatint, 1808.\nThe house was never really adequate for its purpose and it wasn\u2019t long before the lack of space for the expanding collection became critical. In 1802, a committee was set up to discuss how this could be addressed. It was decided that a new gallery should be added and the Townley Gallery was completed in 1808.\nConstruction of the West Wing. Drawing by George Scharf (1788\u20131860). Watercolour, 1828.\nCharles Townley, a noted collector and Trustee of the Museum, after whom the gallery was named, had a significant collection of classical sculpture on display in his house and on his death in 1805, much of this was purchased for the Museum from his family.\nStaircase of Montagu House. Drawing by George Scharf (1788\u20131860). Watercolour, 1845.\nBy the 1820s, and with the collection continuing to expand, George IV\u2019s library also came to the Museum. Plans to house this collection were developed and the new King\u2019s Library building (now Room 1, the Enlightenment Gallery), part of a bigger general scheme by Sir Robert Smirke for the new Museum, were approved in 1823. Three sides of a quadrangle were subsequently constructed to the north of Montagu House, with the fourth side to be built when the house itself was demolished.\nThis early calotype photo of Montagu House was taken by photography pioneer William Henry Fox Talbot, in around 1843, shortly before the final part of the house was completely demolished in 1845.\nThe new building was designed in the \u2018Greek Revival\u2019 style, fashionable in the 18th and early 19th centuries and contrasted starkly with the French style of the original Museum building. It was completed in 1852 and is still the main core of today\u2019s Museum building.\nFind out more facts about the Museum in this handy listicle."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/a-question-of-interpretation/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "A question of interpretation", "author": "Stuart Frost, Head of Interpretation & Volunteers", "timestamp": "2017-06-22 00:00:00", "text": "What is \u2018interpretation\u2019? Broadly speaking, it is anything that help visitors make sense of the Museum and its collection.\nVisitors in the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery (Room 4).\nIt is not about providing information that visitors passively absorb, but more about encouraging visitors to actively engage, to look closer at objects and to reveal something relevant that they might otherwise have missed.\nDeveloping effective interpretation requires detailed knowledge about visitors. We\u2019ve been undertaking rigorous evaluation regularly since 2005 and we have rich invaluable archive of data that informs our work.\nSpecial exhibitions\nWe regularly undertake evaluation for our major special exhibitions. Front-end evaluation is used to establish visitors\u2019 prior knowledge about a subject and their expectations of a new exhibition.\nWhen exhibition plans are more advanced we will then test these qualitatively \u2013\u00a0visitor feedback obtained through this formative evaluation is used to make iterative improvements. Finally, after an exhibition has opened, we undertake summative evaluation to establish how successful an individual project has been in meeting its objectives, and to inform the development of future displays.\nInside the BP exhibition Sunken cities: Egypt\u2019s lost worlds.\nEvaluation of special exhibitions with an admission charge has confirmed that they attract a very different audience to the free permanent galleries. Special exhibition visitors are usually highly motivated and will look at most of the show. The typical dwell time for a major special exhibition is between 75\u00a0and 90 minutes, much higher than a free permanent gallery where the dwell time is often much less. Special exhibitions therefore need bespoke approaches to interpretation.\nPermanent galleries\nEvaluation at the British Museum has transformed the way we develop new permanent galleries. Room 3 is currently used for temporary displays focused on a single object from the collection, The Asahi Shimbun Displays. This space provides an opportunity for the Museum to experiment with new approaches to design and interpretation.\nThe Jericho Skull on display in Room 3.\nEvaluation of previous Asahi Shimbun Displays established some important findings. Firstly, most visitors are drawn to objects first, before looking for the interpretation. Secondly, visitors tend to ignore wall panels or other interpretive texts unless they are in direct proximity to the object that attracts their attention. Thirdly, in free displays most visitors exhibit selective browsing behaviour, rather than thorough sequential viewing.\u00a0 These observations inform our current interpretive philosophy.\nGateway objects\nAs there are over 80 galleries to explore, and the average length of visit to the Museum as whole is just over two and a quarter hours, it is not surprising that the average length of visit to any one gallery is often low. Most of our audience consists of first-time visitors. Some of the older rooms at the Museum contain more objects than any first-time visitor could be expected to deal with in a single visit. As a result we now tend to structure new permanent displays around 20\u201330 particularly important \u2018gateway\u2019 objects, significant objects in the collection that lead into bigger themes. The interpretation is always in a clear and direct relationship with the object, and starts with what the visitor can see, building outwards to tell an overarching story.\nCoins from all nations of the world arranged in a spiral to create a visually appealing display (Room 68). Evaluation tells us that this gateway group of objects is successful at attracting visitors\u2019 attention.\nWe have used gateway objects in numerous displays since 2006, and the evaluation of each display indicates that the approach deepens engagement \u2013 visitors stay for longer and look at more objects. The introduction of gateways in the refurbished Citi Money Gallery (Room 68), for example, contributed to increased dwell time, and an increased number of stops made by visitors.\nCase study: Sutton Hoo\nThe Sir Paul and Lady Ruddock Gallery of Sutton Hoo and Europe AD 300\u20131100\u00a0(Room 41)\u00a0opened in 2014 \u2013 it\u2019s one of the Museum\u2019s most recent galleries. An evaluation of the old display was particularly influential in shaping the current display. The results confirmed that the attracting power of the old displays was disappointing. The few objects that visitors did stop at did not hold their attention for very long, or deliver the stories we wanted to tell.\nRoom 41 before refurbishment.\nThe one exception was a case containing the helmet and shield of an Anglo-Saxon warrior, found in a ship burial at Sutton Hoo (in Suffolk) dating from the early AD 600s. The Sutton Hoo ship burial was one of the most important archaeological discoveries of the 20th\u00a0century \u2013\u00a0the helmet enjoys an almost iconic status in the UK. The popularity of this single case encouraged the project team to move all of the Sutton Hoo objects from their location on the periphery of the old gallery to the physical and conceptual heart of the new gallery.\nThe new display in Room 41.\nThe new interpretation of the Sutton Hoo material was designed to provide visitors with an introduction to the gallery as a whole, explaining some of the key features of the early medieval period. An evaluation of the new current gallery confirms that this approach works well. The vast majority of visitors now come face to face with the Sutton Hoo helmet \u2013 one of the highlights of the Museum\u2019s collection \u2013 and engage with the interpretation of this central display.\nFuture plans\nEvaluation almost always reveals lessons that can be applied to future projects. Each completed project informs those that come after. We are currently focused on three major gallery projects, all of which are structured around the gateway object concept.\nAn artist\u2019s impression of how Room 33 will look after refurbishment.\nThe Sir Joseph Hotung Gallery of China and South Asia (Room 33) will reopen in November 2017, the Mitsubishi Corporation Japanese Galleries (Rooms 92\u201394) will be refurbished in 2018, and the new Albukhary Foundation Galleries of the Islamic world will open towards the end of 2018.

Tate Exchange March 2017. Photo: Richard M Williams.\nI am a Brighton-based artist making socially engaged work. Since 2010 I\u2019ve invited members of the public to consider how the words we use might shape our understanding of each other. Dead Reckoning installations use data collected by the International Organisation for Migration to examine myths about people who are either displaced, or on the move.\nThe project began in April 2015, when I heard about two terrible incidents near Lampedusa, in which two boats sank just six days apart. 1,200 people drowned in the blink of an eye. Like many other people, I was so distressed that I couldn\u2019t tear myself away from the news. I became especially concerned about the language used by some journalists and politicians to describe the people on the boats, as it was very fearful and negative. I searched high and low for names of the people who had died without success. I wanted to find out why they would take such dangerous journeys. All I read was of \u2018swarms\u2019 and \u2018invasion\u2019. I realised that I had to make some work to bear witness to the loss of life and turn the spotlight back to the human beings behind the statistics.\nDiscussion with young children and their parents about the meaning of the boats in Who are We? Tate Exchange 2017. Photo: Richard M Williams.\nI began marbling paper in my kitchen and folding it into thousands of paper boats. I found making the work in the space where my family gather most helped me focus on what we have in common with those forced to take such perilous journeys. From April 2015, each time someone is recorded as missing or drowned in the Mediterranean trying to reach Europe, I have made a boat to represent each individual loss of someone\u2019s brother, sister, neighbour or friend. I hope taking the work into the public arena will encourage others to also consider the similarities we share with these people.\nAs the project has developed I have been able to present the statistics in different ways. For example, Dead Reckoning 2016 is colour coded so you can see month by month which is the most dangerous time to travel. Sadly for some, there still seem to be few safe means of reaching Europe, so deaths continue to rise, and this has resulted in my continued production of boats throughout 2017. This year they will be adorned at random with one of the 23 officially recognised languages of the EU. I look forward to being able to tour them as many countries as I can.\nDead Reckoning 2016 is composed of 5,143 boats and takes 14 hours to install. Many hands make light work though, so I\u2019m hoping to see lots of visitors at the British Museum on Sunday 25 June who will assist me in completing this piece of work, as a celebration of our diverse communities, with hope for a shared future.\nSee Dead Reckoning at the Museum on Sunday 25 June 2017, as part of Refugee Week 2017.\nRefugee Week UK is a nationwide programme of arts, cultural and educational events that celebrate positive contribitions of refugees.

Ink on paper, before 1893. National Diet Library, Tokyo.\nEvery time I think about this exchange between Hokusai and Eijo, I find myself amused at how cheeky she was. To call out \u2018\u014ci\u2019 in Japanese was then, like it still is now, very informal and even rather impolite. When she replied with the lyric of a street-caller soliciting sales from passers-by, she must have been taking the mickey. Hokusai seems to have often called out \u2018\u014ci, \u014ci\u2019\u00a0when he wanted her. So Eijo used characters that replicated the sound of the word \u2018\u014ci\u2019 into an artistic name for herself meaning: \u2018Loyal to Iitsu\u2019. She was referring to the name Hokusai used after he turned sixty, \u2018Iitsu\u2019, meaning \u2018one again.\u2019 With this new name she turned something kind of disrespectful \u2013 that \u2018Hey you!\u2019\u2013 into something that showed her deep connection to Hokusai, and she often signed her work with this name. But Eijo was something more than just loyal to Hokusai. She was his collaborator during the final two decades of his life and may have even worked as his \u2018ghost brush\u2019.\nEijo was the most skilled painter of all of Hokusai\u2019s children. She was, along with her sisters Miyo, Tatsu, and Nao, brought up assisting their father at his trade and in his workshop. Their brother fulfilled a family obligation by apprenticing in the mirror trade and became a successful artisan. But for Hokusai\u2019s daughters, apprenticing in a profession outside the home was not an option \u2013 they were expected to help their family\u2019s occupation until they married and worked for their husbands\u2019 households. They became skilled in all the tasks important to being a painter, from preparing materials to composing pictures, working alongside Hokusai\u2019s other students.\nEijo left Hokusai\u2019s workshop when she married one of his students, the painter Tsutsumi T\u014dmei (active 1804\u20131830), in 1824. She returned to the workshop just three years later when their marriage ended in divorce. It was rumoured that they fell out after Eijo commented, apparently too critically, on T\u014dmei\u2019s lack of skill as a painter. (I can imagine that as the daughter of Hokusai she would have had an opinion about painting!) After her mother, Kotome, died in 1828, Eijo assumed the role of caring for her father, now in his late sixties. Neither she nor her father seemed to care much about keeping house. Rather, they preferred to draw and paint \u2013 it was, after all, the family business \u2013 and working together carried on the Hokusai brand through illustrated books, prints, and paintings.\nKatsushika \u014ci (about 1800\u2013after 1857),\u00a0Treasury of Education for Women (Onna ch\u014dh\u014dki). Illustrated book, woodblock, published by Suharaya, 1847.\nJust as Eijo supported and collaborated with her father, Hokusai also acknowledged and appreciated her talent. Hokusai said that \u2018when it comes to paintings of beautiful women, I can\u2019t compete with her \u2013 she\u2019s quite talented and expert in the technical aspects of painting.\u2019 Looking at her illustrated book of instructions for women and its range of beautiful figures, we can see what Hokusai meant \u2013 these are very skilfully rendered beauties, indeed.\nWe can see from her paintings that he was right about her exceptional technique. Her painting of a night scene in the brothel district is one of the most moving depictions of that quarter, capturing both its artifice and its artificiality. She has turned the courtesans who were so often shown as fashion plates into anonymous figures, obscured by the lattice, capturing the pathos of their existence as indentured prostitutes.\nKatsushika \u014ci (about 1800\u2013after 1857),\u00a0Display room in Yoshiwara at Night.\u00a0Hanging scroll, ink and colour on paper, 1844\u20131854. \u014cta Memorial Museum of Art.\nShe apparently gained a reputation for her skill as a painter during her own lifetime. The artist Keisai Eisen (1790\u20131848) wrote that she \u2018is skilled at drawing, and following after her father has become a professional artist while acquiring a reputation as a talented painter.\u2019 Her knowledge of painting was so complete that she wrote a letter explaining how to prepare the colour red in a letter to a distant pupil, illustrating the letter with fingers showing how to break the raw material down before beginning the process. We wonder, too, how much she might have contributed to Hokusai\u2019s book on painting techniques.\nKatsushika Hokusai,\u00a0Picture book: Essence of Colouring (Ehon saishiki ts\u016b). Illustrated book, woodblock, 2 vols, published by Yamaguchiya T\u014dbei and others, 1848.\nLooking at her painting of legendary warrior Guan Yu having his arm bled to remove poison from an arrow might make us react at first with a little shock and horror, just as his companions do. But if we look beyond the action at the centre of the painting to consider the entire work, we come to admire how she has juxtaposed the violence of his ordeal with the order of the interior. We note how the room and its elements, with its straight columns, elegant furniture, and the still life of food and drink in the background, is designed to provide a counterpoint of quiet against the controlled chaos. What we might not notice right away is that this painting is on silk, replete with saturated pigments, both signs of expense. This painting would have been commissioned, ordered by a well-to-do patron. Unfortunately, the patron is not known, but we can surmise that it was due to her reputation, her skill, and her extraordinary handling of colour that she was asked to paint this scene.\nKatsushika \u014ci (about 1800\u2013after 1857),\u00a0Hua Tuo Operating on the arm of Guan Yu. Hanging scroll, ink and colour on silk, 1840s. The Cleveland Museum of Art, Kelvin Smith Fund 1998.178\nWe are lucky to have a sketch made by one of Hokusai\u2019s students of a memory of a visit he made to the father and daughter in their rented lodgings in the 1840s (see the first illustration). By this time, Eijo would have been in her forties, and she is shown here leaning on her tobacco pipe watching her father at work. Hokusai, now in his eighties, spends his days under the comfort of his kotatsu\u00a0(a heated table), drawing until he falls asleep, waking only to draw again. On the wall behind them a notice states that under no circumstances will they paint for fans or albums \u2013\u00a0for these were minor works for which they would have been paid little. We cannot know just what it is that Hokusai is painting, but we can see from Eijo\u2019s look that she is attending to his process, perhaps conversing, sitting near enough that she could move to assist but not crowding him. It is a picture that shows how Eijo, as a daughter, caretaker and assistant, cared for and collaborated with her father. And she remained with Hokusai throughout the rest of his life, witness to his final words, \u2018just let me live ten more years\u2026 just five more years\u2026\u2019 loyal to Iitsu to his very end.\nYou can see many of Hokusai\u2019s beautiful works made in the last 30 years of his life in the exhibition Hokusai: beyond the Great Wave, on display at the Museum from 25 May to 13 August 2017 (closed 3\u20136 July), supported by Mitsubishi Corporation."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/not-fade-away-preventive-conservation-on-hokusai-prints/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Not fade away: preventive conservation on Hokusai prints", "author": "Capucine Korenberg, Scientist and Andrew Shore", "timestamp": "2017-06-15 00:00:00", "text": "Light represents a great risk to many artworks, including Japanese woodblock prints from the 18th and 19th centuries. This is because they were often made using plant-based dyes, which can fade when exposed to light. Many Japanese prints have faded dramatically since they were made. Look at the two copies of a woodblock print by the Japanese artist Utamaro below. The copies were identical when the prints were produced. Now, most of the colours in the print on the right have faded.\nKitagawa Utamaro, (1754\u20131806), two impressions of\u00a0A mother feeding her infant in front of a mirror. Colour woodblock, c. 1797.\nHokusai\u2019s most iconic prints are \u2018The Great Wave\u2019 and \u2018Red Fuji\u2019 and the British Museum is\u00a0fortunate to have impressions of both of them. The inks used in these prints had never been scientifically analysed, so in preparation for the exhibition Hokusai: beyond the Great Wave, we decided to investigate how likely they are to fade, to make sure we can display them safely.\nPeter McElhinney, a PhD student from the University of Bradford, joined the Museum for a short period to work with me on these prints. Together we\u00a0analysed the colourants of \u2018Red Fuji\u2019 and \u2018The Great Wave\u2019 using two techniques: X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and multispectral imaging (MSI). These techniques are well suited to the study of museum objects as they do not damage the objects or require removing samples.\nXRF tells us which chemical elements are present in the inks, but not which compounds. For instance, if we detect the presence of lead in a pink paint, we need to do additional investigations to determine if the paint contains lead white (a white pigment containing lead) or red lead (a red pigment containing lead), or if it is a mixture of both pigments. XRF is also unable to detect lighter chemical elements, such as carbon or oxygen.\nMSI involves exposing an object to different types of light (infrared, visible and ultraviolet) resulting in different images reflected from the print. Observing whether an ink absorbs or reflects the light gives us clues as to its identity. Combining the infrared or ultraviolet reflected image with the visible reflected image of the object produces a \u2018false-colour\u2019 image, which may help to identify the ink used in the print. For instance, in false colour infrared (FCIR) images indigo, a dark blue dye commonly obtained from a tropical plant, appears bright red.\nTop: Katsushika Hokusai (1760\u20131849), Clear day with a southern breeze (Red Fuji) from Thirty-Six Views of Mt Fuji. Colour woodblock, 1831. Bottom: FCIR image.\nThe FCIR image of \u2018Red Fuji\u2019 is striking. We can clearly see where indigo has been used on the print: the title cartouche, the signature, the outline of Mount Fuji and the tiny trees on the mountain. The blue sky was coloured using a different ink, which contains a large amount of iron. This tells us it is Prussian blue (its common scientific name is ferric ferrocyanide). Prussian blue is the first modern synthetic pigment and it had just been adopted for commercial printing in Japan from China and Europe when Hokusai\u2019s prints were made. Prussian blue was also used on the green area of the mountain, where a yellow pigment, orpiment, was added to Prussian blue to produce the green colour. Orpiment is an arsenic sulphide mineral used as a pigment for centuries.\nTop: Katsushika Hokusai (1760\u20131849), Under the Wave off Kanagawa (The Great Wave). Colour woodblock print, c. 1831. Acquired with Art Fund support. Bottom: FCIR image.\nIn \u2018The Great Wave\u2019 we clearly see from the FCIR image above that, again, indigo was used to print the outline of the image, the title cartouche and the signature, but also the dark areas on the waves. This is evident from the offset at the bottom left-hand side of the print. Prussian blue was used to print the medium blue of the waves. More tests will be needed to find out which ink was used for the light blue of the waves. Arsenic was detected on some parts of the boats using XRF, which suggests the use of orpiment.\nPeter McElhinney conducting microfading tests on \u2018The Great Wave\u2019.\nHaving gathered information on the inks of these two prints, Peter and I then investigated how light sensitive they are by conducting microfading tests. This technique involves focusing a tiny spot of very bright light (0.3mm wide \u2013 the width of a few human hairs) on an area of the print and measuring how much the colour changes using a spectrometer, an instrument which is much more sensitive to colour changes than the human eye. A microfading test is very fast: it usually runs for only 10 minutes. Because the spot of light is so small and the test is stopped immediately if the colour change becomes visible, this technique is completely safe to the print. Microfading is very useful to determine rapidly if an object is light sensitive and the method is used by many museums around the world.\nMost of the inks are of low or medium light sensitivity in the microfading tests. However, orpiment, the yellow pigment present on both prints, is known to be very light sensitive. For instance, it was used on ancient Egyptian papyri and there are many examples where it has completely faded. You can see this in the images below. The fading of orpiment is a complex process and unfortunately represents a rare instance where microfading fails to detect its light sensitivity.\nSections of Book of the Dead of Ani. The papyrus on the left has been kept in storage while the papyrus on the right was on display for many years. You can see how the horizontal band coloured with orpiment at the top is yellow on the left and colourless on the right.\nBased on these findings, Peter and I advised that \u2018Red Fuji\u2019 and \u2018The Great Wave\u2019 should not be on display for more than 20% of the time and exposed to only dim light (no more than 50 lux, which is the minimal amount of light required to view any object). This means that if these prints are displayed for three months at 50 lux, they should be stored in the dark for at least a year before they are displayed again. While these measures will not stop fading from occurring altogether, they will ensure that these world-famous prints fade so slowly that they will be seen by countless generations of visitors to the Museum in the future.\nHokusai: beyond the Great Wave is on display at the Museum from 25 May to 13 August 2017 (closed 3\u20136 July for conservation reasons), supported by Mitsubishi Corporation."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/time-to-shine-a-17th-century-night-clock/", "category": "Curator's corner", "title": "Time to shine: a 17th-century night clock", "author": "Oliver Cooke, Curator: Horological Collections", "timestamp": "2017-06-13 00:00:00", "text": "For as long as I can remember I have been drawn to this clock, a longcase night clock in a marquetry case that is signed \u2018Eduardus East Londini\u2019. It is on display in the Museum\u2019s Clocks and Watches Galleries\u00a0(Rooms 38\u201339) and now features in the latest episode of Curator\u2019s Corner:\nThe first thing to note is the unusual dial. Amid the beautifully organic, all-over floral engraving is the arc of a \u2018wandering hour\u2019 dial, so called because the hour numeral wanders up and over the arc during course of an hour \u2013 its position against the minute and quarter markings indicates the time. In the photo below, the clock is showing 12.14.\nThe wandering-hour dial.\nAt the end of an hour, the numeral disappears beyond the right-hand end of the arc and the next hour appears on the left-hand side. This is made to work by having the numerals on a chain, with consecutive hours set five numerals apart.\nThe chain of pierced-out hour numerals.\nThe numerals and markings are cut out of the brass, which allows the light from an oil lamp or candle to shine through, thus allowing the time to be read at night. This was useful in the 17th century as one could not summon light with a mere flick of a switch. While many clocks of the time could sound the time by striking a bell, this would not do in the bed-chamber where it would wake the occupants every hour.\nLeft: A modern work-lamp now rests on the bracket which was intended for an oil lamp or candle. Right: The illuminated dial.\nThere is something of a flaw in this design however \u2013 naked flames and wood do not go well together (or perhaps rather too well). Indeed, fires might account for the rarity of these clocks \u2013 I think that only about five other longcase night clocks survive today. In the mid-1670s a new mechanism was invented that enabled clocks to strike the hour on demand by pulling a cord or lever. This was called \u2018repeating work\u2019 and these clocks could give the time in the dark just when it was needed. I am not aware of any longcase night clocks that are dated after this development. There are, however, a greater number of Italian night clocks, some even post-dating repeating work \u2013 but that is a story for another day\u2026\nClose-up of the marquetry on the trunk door. Can you spot the butterfly and snail?\nLet\u2019s turn to the beautiful marquetry case. Marquetry is the decorative technique of inlaying different coloured woods to form naturalistic designs. While the \u2018bird and flower\u2019 design seen here is a wonderful counterpart to the dial of this clock, we know by its style that the case must post-date it by 10 to 15 years (plus there is evidence that the case has been altered, suggesting that it originally housed a different sized dial). It is likely that the clock movement would have originally had a rather more austere case. The reason for this change could be that the original case became ashes.\nA more typical London longcase clock of c. 1700, by Joseph Knibb, c. 1675.\nBeing fascinated with this clock, I started thinking about its maker, Edward East, and what other wonders he might have made. He was born in Southill, Bedfordshire, in 1602 and died around 1697. He lived through what was a very eventful century of English history. He had moved to London by 1618 when he became an apprentice of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, serving under Richard Rogers, Comptroller of the Mint. He completed his apprenticeship in 1627 and by 1632 we know he was already well established in business, as he was named in the inaugural charter of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers.\nProperty records show that he remained active in business through the English Civil War and its aftermath. Just three months after the Restoration in 1660, he became clockmaker to King Charles II. In his time in London he survived three major outbreaks of plague and in 1666 was unlucky to lose his workshop to the Great Fire. He moved to Hampton Court in the 1690s, but continued to be involved in his business from there at least until 1694. The Museum holds one other clock and seven watches by East in the collection.\nLeft: Watch in rock crystal case. Right: Table clock. Both by Edward East, London, c. 1640\nUnusually for Museum objects, many clocks that were made after the 16th century were signed by their makers, which is useful in telling us where and when they were made. Having said that, we know that East was working for at least 67 years, so this does not really help us to pin down an accurate date for this clock. We do already know that it was probably not made after the invention of repeating work in the mid-1670s. Furthermore, it features another invention of around 1671 (the anchor escapement). So we can conservatively date the clock mechanism to around 1675.\nWe might know who made the clock and when, but we do not know who first owned it. Only the very wealthy would have been able to afford a longcase clock at this time. Moreover, that it is a night clock and not a standard clock of the period possibly suggests that it was a commission. So, who would want or need to know the time in a dark room? Well, Pope Alexander VII for one, who in 1655 ordered Cardinal Farnese to provide a clock which would show the hours at night and in silence. Three brothers from Umbria rose to the challenge and\u00a0invented the wandering hour dial, later used on some English clocks such as the East one. Also, in his diary, Samuel Pepys tells us that on Friday 24 June 1664 he was shown Catherine of Braganza\u2019s bed-chamber \u2018with her clock by her bed-side, wherein a lamp burns that tells her the time of the night at any time\u2019. The East night clock of around 1675 is clearly not that clock, but you can at least see the high status of those who might have originally owned this wonderful clock."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-technique-of-making-a-good-impression/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "The technique of making a good impression", "author": "Alfred Haft, JTI Project Curator for Japanese Collections and Andrew Shore", "timestamp": "2017-06-10 00:00:00", "text": "Thanks to the refined technique of woodblock printing, Japanese society during the Edo period (1615\u20131868) enjoyed a rich supply of books and pamphlets, pictures and artworks.\nThe technique is particularly associated with pictures of the \u2018floating world\u2019 (ukiyo-e) \u2013 those celebrated, full-colour depictions of courtesans, actors and famous places that collectors have long admired and that the Impressionists embraced as a source of inspiration.\nUtagawa Kunisada (1786\u20131864), Shokunin (Artisans).

An artist\u2019s final brush-drawing (or \u2018block-ready drawing\u2019) initiated the printmaking process, but few examples survive. They were usually pasted onto a woodblock and destroyed as the master block cutter traced the artist\u2019s lines onto the block with a chisel.

Fuji, by Katsushika Hokusai.\nA standard colour print might require four of five woodblocks cut on both sides, while a specially commissioned print (surimono) might require ten or more blocks.\u00a0 Mountain cherry (yamazakura) was, and still is, the wood of choice for the process because its grain is dense and durable. The woodblock we\u2019ve used in the display is a modern example, but examples of original ukiyo-e woodblocks are very similar \u2013 the technique has changed little since the time of Hokusai and Kunisada.\nKatsushika Hokusai\u00a0(1760\u20131849).\u00a0Fuji-view Moor in Owari Province. Colour woodblock,\u00a01830\u20131833.\nThe pigments in traditional Japanese prints came from different sources. Many were derived from plants, such as safflower for red, and others from minerals. Around the late 1820s, the synthetic pigment Prussian blue (bero-ai) caused a sensation when it became widely available as it was a stable and lightfast pigment that resisted fading over time. The initial designs in Hokusai\u2019s famous series Thirty-six Views of Mt Fuji (1831\u201333) were printed solely in Prussian blue and indigo.\u00a0 Subsequent designs, including the iconic Great Wave (1831), began to incorporate other colours.\nUtagawa Hiroshige (1797\u20131858), No 46, Shono haku-u. Colour woodblock, c. 1833\u20131834.\nMaster printers combined basic pigments to create a range of colours, and they were also skilled at creating special effects. For example, the rain-drenched scene Sudden Shower at Sh\u014dno by Utagawa Hiroshige (1797\u20131858) includes a beautiful example of a favourite printing technique \u2013 gradation (bokashi). This was used by artists to suggest depth and atmosphere. Gradation required the printer to wipe pigment from the woodblock in a controlled manner, bringing to life the range of tones in the artist\u2019s original design. The process had to be done by hand, so no two examples of gradation are exactly alike.\nThe display shows how the exquisite detail and colour of Japanese woodblock printing was achieved, by revealing the little-known processes behind this beautiful art form."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/pay-attention/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Pay attention", "author": "Susan Tallman, Editor-in-Chief, Art in Print", "timestamp": "2017-06-05 00:00:00", "text": "In 2014, when Stephen Coppel first spoke with me about his planned show on contemporary American prints, the title \u2013 The American Dream \u2013 seemed succinct and evocative. It swept together the exuberance of American pop, the pragmatic purity of American minimalism, the nostalgia and disquiet of postmodernism, and even made an ironic nod to the racism and inequity that underlay the Dream, even at its most convincing. Further, there was the echo of Jasper Johns\u2019 claim that the idea of painting the American flag \u2013 a painting that changed the way we think about what art is and does \u2013 had come to him in a dream. (Johns\u2019s 1973 Flags I screenprint, which emblazons the exhibition\u2019s posters and catalogue, is one of the most heartbreakingly beautiful descendants of that painting.)\nBut by 2017, the phrase \u2018the American Dream\u2019 had become vastly more fraught. A thesaurus-ful of bleak near-relations present themselves (Illusion? Delusion? Nightmare?). And this made things complicated when I came to give a talk on the American Dream shortly after the show opened.\nJasper Johns\u2019\u00a0Flags I in the exhibition. Photo: Kate Marsden.\nThe exhibition itself is a triumph. It captures decisively one of the great half-centuries in the history of art \u2013 ambitious, adventurous, self-aware and socially alert. But to American eyes, the trajectory is freighted with a certain Moby-Dick quality: epic in scope; irreverent, erudite and sublime; hedonistic and moralising in the same breath; a brilliant juggernaut that lurches, eyes wide open, toward calamity. Observant visitors can even trace a nautical motif through the galleries, from Claes Oldenburg\u2019s serenely dysfunctional Floating Three-Way Plug (1976), to Vija Celmin\u2019s implacable Ocean Surface Woodcut 1992\u00a0(1992), to the haunted slave ships of Willie Cole (Stowage, 1997) and Kara Walker (No World, 2010) \u2013 an arc not dissimilar to Melville\u2019s.\nIn the end, I chose to wrap my talk around the Bruce Nauman\u2019s salty, epithet-laden, Pay Attention (1973). The print is a dynamic, recursive puzzle: the backwards, stammering letters slow our reading of words whose essence is urgency \u2013 words that demand, in the rudest possible terms, that we pay attention, but to what? The print points nowhere but to itself. Pay attention to paying attention.\nAnd that, I have come to think, is the directive that made American art great.\nWhen Roy Lichtenstein enlarged those half-tone dots, he was directing attention to a concrete reality designed to escape notice (in commercial printing the dots are supposed to disappear). In the art gallery, where we\u2019ve been taught to look past the surface of things to seek out their meaning, Lichtenstein asked us instead to pay attention to what we actually see. The art and artists that followed \u2013 conceptual or minimal, neo-expressionist or photo-realist \u2013 sought out the overlooked and invented strategies for making it visible.\nEd Ruscha (b. 1937),\u00a0Ghost Station.\u00a0Mixografia inkless print on white handmade paper, 2011.\u00a0\u00a9 Ed Ruscha. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nAnd no artist has more deftly cajoled us into considering both idea and illusion, the medium and to the message, than Ed Ruscha. So when, near the end of the exhibition, we come across Ruscha\u2019s Ghost Station (2011) \u2013 a colourless, elegiac, embossed echo of his vibrant Standard Station (1967) seen a few rooms earlier \u2013 it feels like an epigraph: America, blanched of everything but the memory of its former glory.\nEd Ruscha (b. 1937),\u00a0Standard Station. Colour screen print, 1966. The\u00a0Museum of Modern Art, New York/Scala, Florence. \u00a9 Ed Ruscha. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nBut this is too tidy an interpretation. The truth is that the most powerful artworks here \u2013 from Johns to Nauman to Celmins to Ruscha to the nimble etchings by Julie Mehretu that close the show, are paeans to uncertainty and incompleteness. To pay attention to paying attention is to open an infinite loop, not to locate a coherent answer.\nWhen, partway through Moby-Dick, the narrator abandons his attempt at a complete cetacean taxonomy, he comes to a similar realisation: \u2018God keep me from ever completing anything. This whole book is but a draught \u2013 nay, but the draught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!\u2019\nAnd there it is: the American Dream.\nThe exhibition\u00a0The American Dream: pop to the present\u00a0runs at the Museum until\u00a018 June 2017.\nSponsored by Morgan Stanley.\nSupported by the Terra Foundation for American Art.\nBuy the book to explore\u00a0the unprecedented scale, boldness and ambition of American printmaking since the 1960s.\nYou can also browse\u00a0a range of products inspired by the works\u00a0in the exhibition, including a range of prints."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/hokusai-in-ultra-hd-great-wave-big-screen/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Hokusai in Ultra HD: Great Wave, big screen", "author": "Patricia Wheatley, Head of Creative: Broadcast and Andrew Shore", "timestamp": "2017-06-02 00:00:00", "text": "In our new cinema broadcast,\u00a0British Museum presents: Hokusai \u2013 in cinemas across the UK on Sunday 4 June \u2013 Tim Clark, Head of the Japanese Section at the British Museum, compares curating the exhibition Hokusai: beyond the Great Wave to climbing Mount Fuji: a long hard slog rewarded by sublime views at the end. I could say the same for the documentary we have just made on Hokusai, with hopefully the same results.\nI wanted to make a film about Hokusai because I think he\u2019s the perfect subject to bring to our audiences. He\u2019s an artist who has made works of art, including the iconic Great Wave and Red Fuji, that everyone recognises \u2013 and yet one who is still largely unknown in the UK. Surprisingly, this is the first UK film biography of him.\nHokusai literally worked with the cutting-edge technology of his time, designing exquisite woodblock prints that were a mass-market success. \u2018The Great Wave\u2019 ran to an edition of thousands and you could own a print for the same price as a double portion of noodles. Filming in Tokyo this spring, what struck me was the link between the technology of Hokusai\u2019s time, 200 years ago, and that of today, a very Japanese success story.\nOkada Takuya in the Takahashi studio\u00a0recreating Hokusai\u2019s Great Wave.\nI wanted to show the skill and artistry that went into producing Hokusai\u2019s prints as well as their widespread influence today. At the Takahashi studio in Tokyo we filmed master block cutter Asaka Motoharu and printer Okada Takuya recreating Hokusai\u2019s Great Wave, sticking an outline drawing on to a cherry woodblock, meticulously reproducing the ink strokes of the drawing with the finest cutting tools and applying the pigments to produce a vivid replica of Hokusai\u2019s iconic design.\nWe argue in our film that Hokusai was the father of the manga\u00a0comics and anime films that dominate Japanese popular culture. Manga literally means \u2018random pictures\u2019 and Hokusai\u2019s original manga were a series of drawing manuals. Uragami Mitsuru has been collecting Hokusai\u2019s manga for almost 50 years and now owns 1,500 volumes. We filmed him at the Toppan printing company where Uragami\u2019s collection has been digitised, to share the incredible richness of Hokusai\u2019s imaginative invention and pictorial universe.

One of my favourite locations was the Oyha Shobo bookshop in the heart of Tokyo, a wondrous Aladdin\u2019s cave of antique books and prints, where you can still buy these volumes and copies of Hokusai pictures.\nA block-ready drawing inscribed \u2018Strongman hero Benkei steals the bell\u2019 from\u00a0Picture Book: Japan and China in the Katsushika Style (Ehon Wakan Katsushika-buri) (c. 1836)\u00a0by\u00a0Katsushika Hokusai (1760\u20131849).\u00a0\u00a9 The Metropolitan Museum of Art/Scala.\nWe were very fortunate that our partners at the Japanese state broadcaster NHK were keen to try out their prototype 8K video technology to support the British Museum\u2019s research project on Hokusai\u2019s work. This pioneering technology is by some magnitude the highest resolution image so far achieved, providing extraordinary high definition close-ups. A large team of expert technicians brought their equipment from Japan and installed it in the Museum, filming with a surgical precision some of Hokusai\u2019s most celebrated prints and the remarkable painted scrolls that were his last works and the ultimate expression of his genius. The unprecedented level of close-up detail and clarity revealed secrets of Hokusai\u2019s technique that astounded Tim and fellow Hokusai scholar Roger Keyes.\nI like to think it was this meeting of ultra-hi-tech and Hokusai\u2019s Japanese graphic elegance that appealed to David Hockney when he agreed to an interview for the documentary. Hockney is a lifelong Hokusai fan. Speaking as a mere 80-year-old to Hokusai\u2019s 90, he shares the great artist\u2019s absolute commitment to his art and I\u2019m sure Hokusai would have exploited and revelled in today\u2019s 21st-century technologies just as Hockney has done.\nYou can see many of Hokusai\u2019s beautiful works made in the last 30 years of his life in the exhibition\u00a0Hokusai: beyond the Great Wave, on display at the Museum from 25 May to 13 August 2017 (closed 3\u20136 July), supported by Mitsubishi Corporation.\nBritish Museum presents: Hokusai is coming to a cinema near you.\u00a0Find your nearest venue.

Monster soup commonly called Thames water, being a correct representation of that precious stuff doled out to us!!! Hand-coloured etching, c. 1828.\nThe British Museum has over 2,000 objects in its collection that have been found in the Thames. Some of them predate the city\u2019s foundation, and they can tell us fascinating stories about London\u2019s history. Most were recovered during the 19th and early 20th century, often found by workmen in the course of dredging and the building of bridges and locks, so we do not always know their exact findspots or circumstances of recovery.\nHere are eight intriguing objects, dating from the Neolithic period to Tudor\u00a0times \u2013 that\u2019s nearly 5,000 years of throwing (or losing) things in the river!\n1. A Neolithic polished macehead\nPerforated stone polished macehead\u00a0(centre), 3300\u20132300 BC.\nHumans have lived along the Thames since the earliest periods of prehistory, with the archaeological record stretching back to first human settlement of the British Isles. Long before London was built, we find scatters of artefacts along the edge of the river suggesting that people were living there. By the Neolithic (4000\u20132200 BC), we start to see specially produced prestige objects, such as this polished stone macehead, found in the Thames near Twickenham, and made out of precious materials. Research suggests that while maces may have been used as weapons, it is most likely that they are ceremonial and possibly symbols of power because of the effort and skill required to make them. Their discovery may represent the beginning of a long history of deliberately depositing precious objects in the river, possibly as ritualistic offerings.\n2. A bronze sword\nLeaf-shaped, bronze (copper-alloy) sword dated to the Late Bronze Age. On display in Room 1.\nDuring the Bronze Age (2200\u2013800 BC) and the Iron Age (800 BC\u2013AD 43), the River Thames was a popular place to make offerings and sacrifices, especially along the stretch from Battersea to Waterloo. This may have been the site of crossing points across the powerful and turbulent river, or perhaps a sacred place, or an important political boundary \u2013 maybe all of these things. The remains of ancient human skulls have also been found in the river. Perhaps the weapons and other objects accompanied the watery burial of the dead, or were spoils of war being dedicated to the gods by victorious warriors. Casting these beautiful and important objects into the water may even have simply been a display of wealth and power\u00a0\u2013 we don\u2019t know for sure.\n3. The Battersea shield\nThe Battersea shield. Iron Age, c. 350\u201350 BC. On display in Room 50.\nThis magnificent shield was found in the River Thames in 1857, where Battersea Bridge stands today. It dates to the Iron Age, between 350 and 50 BC. The Battersea shield is not actually a complete shield, but only the facing \u2013 a metal cover that was attached to the front of wooden shield. The shield does not show signs of damage in combat, but this does not necessarily mean that it was not used in warfare. Flamboyant display seems to have been an important part of Iron Age battles, and both weapons and armour are often highly decorative. This decoration is sometimes hidden. Even the handle of this shield was very ornate. Perhaps the swirling designs were believed to hold magical or protective properties which empowered warriors. The highly polished bronze and glinting red glass on the shield would certainly have made for a great spectacle. Ultimately, though, it was thrown or placed in the River Thames, where many weapons were offered as sacrifices in the Bronze and Iron Ages.\n4. The Waterloo helmet\nWaterloo helmet. Iron Age, c. 250\u201350 BC. On display in Room 50.\nFound in 1868 while dredging near Waterloo Bridge, this is the only Iron Age helmet to have ever been found in southern England, and the only Iron Age helmet with horns ever to have been found anywhere in Europe. It is unlikely to have been used in battle and was probably a form of ceremonial headdress. Being made from thin bronze sheets it would have been too fragile for use in battle.\u00a0It has elaborate decoration (La T\u00e8ne style) used in Britain between 250 and 50 BC. Originally, the bronze helmet would have been a shining polished bronze colour, not the dull green colour it is today. It was also once decorated with studs of bright red glass, like the Battersea shield.\n5. A bust of Hadrian\nBronze head of the Roman emperor Hadrian. On display in Room 49.\nIn AD 43, the Roman\u2019s established the first major town along the Thames \u2013 Londinium. This was a major port and had an important river crossing along a narrow section of the Thames, near where the modern London Bridge is located. Many remains from the Roman town can still be under the modern City of London. Dating from the reign of the Roman emperor Hadrian (AD 117\u2013138), this head from a large statue of the emperor was dredged up from the bed of the Thames at the site of old London Bridge in 1834. It is very likely that the findspot is close to the statue\u2019s original location in a central area of Londinium. The statue probably stood in a public space such as a forum, and may have been put up to commemorate Hadrian\u2019s visit to Britain in AD 122. There are many known marble statues of him, but this bronze example is a rare survival.\n6. A Viking sword\nDouble-edged Viking sword. 10th century AD.\nThere are also plenty of early medieval finds from the Thames, including Anglo-Saxon and Viking weapons. The Vikings raided London multiple times in the 9th and 10th centuries in their bids to gain control of England\u00a0(there\u2019s even a theory that the nursery rhyme London Bridge Is Falling Down is about a Viking raid!). However it\u2019s not entirely clear why these weapons are there \u2013 were these ritual and deliberate deposits or losses during transit or in battle? This particular sword was likely found in the river, and is now on display in Room 41.\n7. A pilgrim badge\nMedieval pilgrim badge. 14th\u201315th centuries.\nLondon was the starting point for the most significant pilgrimage route in medieval England, to St Thomas Becket\u2019s shrine at Canterbury Cathedral. The route followed the old Roman road Watling Street across London Bridge to its first stop in Southwark, where pilgrims gathered at the Tabard Inn\u00a0(famously the starting point for Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales). In the Middle Ages, the Church encouraged people to make pilgrimages to holy shrines as it was believed that by making this arduous journey on foot your sins would be forgiven. Becket\u2019s tomb became the most popular shrine in England. People would wear pilgrim badges to mark their journey and would often acquire them as tokens or souvenirs along the route. Thousands of pilgrimage badges have been recovered from the Thames, many from around London Bridge, including this one. The three fishes may represent the Holy Trinity or the lombardic \u2018M\u2019, a symbol for the Virgin Mary. It is debated if these badges were simply lost in travel, or deposited into the river for good luck after returning from pilgrimage.\n8. A Tudor\u00a0toy\nPewter doll. Late 16th century.\nOver the years, many tears must have been shed by children over their beloved toys, which suddenly fell out of their grasp and over a bridge or wall with no possibility of rescue. This doll, found at Bull Wharf in London, takes us close to her original owner, a small girl in late Tudor London. The doll is a rare find. Cast in lead alloy, it is almost complete. Her dress is so exactly detailed that she can be dated to the late 1500s. She wears a heart-shaped hood, a fitted bodice which is laced at the back and a full skirt, which opens at the front to reveal an underskirt. We know very little about who made these hollow-cast dolls, but we think they were sold at city fairs such as St Bartholomew\u2019s Fair at Smithfield in London.\nThe water of the Thames has preserved these objects for us to rediscover and display today. What secrets will the river give up to future generations? Whatever they may be, they will provide a fascinating glimpse into London\u2019s ongoing history."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/introducing-the-scythians/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Introducing the Scythians", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2017-05-30 00:00:00", "text": "The Scythians (pronounced \u2018SIH-thee-uns\u2019) were a group of ancient tribes of nomadic warriors who originally lived in what is now southern Siberia. Their culture flourished from around 900 BC to around 200 BC, by which time they had extended their influence all over Central Asia \u2013 from China to the northern Black Sea.\nFrom September 2017 you can discover these fearsome warriors and their culture in a special exhibition at the British Museum. But before that, swot up on some key facts and impress your friends down the pub with your new-found Scythian knowledge.\n1. They were formidable warriors\nGold plaque of a mounted Scythian. Black Sea region, c. 400\u2013350 BC. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017. Photo: V Terebenin.\nUntil the 1700s, a lot of what we knew about the Scythians was cobbled together from a range of ancient sources \u2013 none of them written by the Scythians themselves as they didn\u2019t \u2018do\u2019 writing. So what we had was a collection of accounts written by Greeks, Assyrians and Persians \u2013 and they were usually terrified (although often also impressed).\nThe Greek historian Herodotus, in his Histories (Book 4, 5th century BC), wrote: \u2018None who attacks them can escape, and none can catch them if they desire not to be found.\u2019 Assyrian inscriptions from the 7th century BC also refer to fighting Scythians, with one mentioning a peace treaty secured by marrying off an Assyrian princess to a Scythian king.\nWhen the Scythians weren\u2019t being hide and seek champions, or being fobbed off with foreign princesses, they even developed a powerful new type of bow which was made from different layers of wood and sinew. It was much more powerful than a regular wooden bow, as the different layers increased the forces and energy when the string was released.\nGold sew-on clothing appliqu\u00e9 in the form of two Scythian archers.\nIn battles, the Scythians would use large numbers of highly mobile archers who could shower hundreds of deadly arrows within a few minutes. As late as the 6th century AD a Byzantine writer described the deadly effect of mounted archers like these: \u2018they do not let up at all until they have achieved the complete destruction of their enemies.\u2019 If this were not terrifying enough, several classical writers state that the Scythians dipped their arrows in poison!\nScythian arrow heads.\u00a0\u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017. Photo: V Terebenin.\nWhen the Scythians fought on foot, their weapon of choice was a battle-axe with a long narrow pointed blade (like a narrow pick-axe). This type of fighting was personal and face to face \u2013 the weapons\u2019 tell-tale puncture marks have been found on the heads of excavated human remains.\nSo all in all, pretty fearsome.\n2. They were nomads\nScythians with horses under a tree. Gold belt plaque. Siberia, 4th\u20133rd century BC. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017. Photo: V Terebenin.\nThe brilliantly named \u2018pseudo-Hippocrates\u2019 wrote that: \u2018The Scyths\u2026 have no houses but live in wagons. These are very small with four wheels. Others with six wheels are covered with felt; such wagons are employed like houses, in twos or threes and provide shelter from rain and wind \u2026 The women and children live in these wagons, but the men always remain on horseback.\u2019\nNomadic peoples tended not to leave a lot behind in terms of cities or literature \u2013 what used to be called \u2018civilisation\u2019. What we know of the Scythians is largely through excavations of burial mounds (kurgans), and examples of rock art. It is from these remains that we have the archaeological evidence to see if the ancient writers like Herodotus were right \u2013 or if they were making it up as they went along.\nIn fact, our old friend Herodotus thought that the fact they were nomads meant they were extra scary:\n\u2018For when men have no stablished cities or fortresses, but all are house-bearers and mounted archers, living not by tilling the soil but by cattle-rearing and carrying their dwellings on wagons, how should these not be invincible and unapproachable?\u2019 (Histories, Book 4)\nBeing nomadic, of course, meant having portable possessions that were robust. The objects the Scythians buried with their dead are generally small or lightweight \u2013 such as small drinking flasks and wooden bowls. There is no furniture to speak of \u2013 the few surviving tables are low and come apart. Thick floor coverings were essential though \u2013 sheepskins, felt rugs and even an imported pile carpet have all been found in tombs.\n3. They loved their horses\nArtist\u2019s impression of a Scythian on a horse.\u00a0Reconstruction by D V Pozdnjakov.\nSiberia is vast. It stretches over eight time zones and borders Europe, China, the Pacific Ocean and Arctic Circle. It is made up of three major ecological zones \u2013 icy tundra at the north, dense forest in the central part, and mixed woodland and grassy steppe in the south. This last section forms a wide grassy corridor of rich grazing from Mongolia and China to the Black Sea. It is here that the Scythians began to develop more efficient ways of riding horses which meant they could move bigger herds to new grazing grounds over larger distances.\nThe Scythians developed horse breeding and riding to a new level. They were accomplished riders and did not use spiked bits or muzzles. Scythian horse gear (saddles, bridles, bits etc) was also highly developed and functional, durable and light. We know this because the large burial mounds contain large numbers of sacrificed horses. These were accompanied by halters, bridles and saddles, and occasionally whips, pouches and shields.\nThe saddle horses were buried with very elaborate costumes including headgear with griffins or antlers, saddle covers decorated with combat scenes, and long dangling pendants.\nHorse headgear.\u00a0\u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017. Photo: V Terebenin.\nScythian horses were well looked after \u2013 many were aged between 15 and 20 years when they were put to the grave. Almost all the buried horses were killed in the same manner \u2013 a hard blow of a pointed battle-axe to the mid-forehead. Although this is regarded today as a \u2018humane\u2019 method, within a society which prized horses, the killing of horses must have made a deep impression.\n4. They liked getting drunk and high!\nGold plaques showing Scythians drinking.\u00a0\u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017. Photo: V Terebenin.\nLike many cultures, the Scythians drank to excess and got high. Feasting was an important part of Scythian funeral ceremonies \u2013 it was also important for social bonding between individuals and tribes. Originally known as \u2018milk drinkers\u2019, the Scythians adopted wine consumption from Greeks and Persians. They soon acquired a reputation for excessive drinking of undiluted wine (the Greeks used to mix their wine with water). Greek authors then commented on how the Scythians, like the Persians, liked to drink to excess. You can lead a horse(man) to water (but he\u2019d prefer wine, apparently).\nHerodotus also describes how the Scythians had a ritual which involved getting high on hemp in a kind of mobile \u2018weed sauna\u2019:\n\u2018They anoint and wash their heads; as for their bodies, they set up three poles leaning together to a point and cover these over with woollen mats; then, in the place so enclosed to the best of their power, they make a pit in the centre beneath the poles and the mats and throw red-hot stones into it\u2026 The Scythians then take the seed of this hemp and, creeping under the mats, they throw it on the red-hot stones; and, being so thrown, it smoulders and sends forth so much steam that no Greek vapour-bath could surpass it. The Scythians howl in their joy at the vapour-bath. This serves them instead of bathing, for they never wash their bodies with water.\u2019 (Histories, Book 4)\nThe Scythians realised the pain relieving effects of marijuana, which no doubt came in useful if they had been in a riding accident or a fierce battle.\n5. They were tattooed\nFragment of mummified skin showing a Scythian tattoo.\u00a0\u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017.

They include fantastic animals locked in combat, rows of birds and simple dots resembling modern acupuncture.\nLine drawings of tattoos on\u00a0a Scythian man.\nOther than tattoos, what did the Scythians look like? Some of the women have fair hair and blue eyes but the men are strongly built and have red or dark hair.\n6. They liked a bit of bling\nGold torc with turquoise inlays.\u00a0\u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017. Photo: V Terebenin.\nScythian craftsmen were good at casting metal. They worked gold, bronze and iron, using a combination of techniques like casting, forging and inlaying with other materials. None of these required large amounts of equipment and Siberia is rich in metal ores, but it did require skill. There will be many exquisite examples of Scythian metalwork in the exhibition.\n7. They mummified their dead\nArtist\u2019s impression of a burial mound. Watercolour illustration, 18th century. Archive of the Institute of Archaeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, St Petersburg.\nIn the high Altai mountain region near the borders of Russia, Kazakhstan, China and Mongolia, the frozen subsoil has meant that the organic remains of Scythians buried in tombs have been exceptionally well preserved in permafrost.\nThe Scythians took great effort to preserve the appearance of the dead using a form of mummification. They removed the brain matter through holes cut in the head, sliced the bodies and removed as much soft tissue as possible before replacing both with dry grass and sewing up the skin.\nWooden coffin.

Photo: V Terebenin.\nAs already noted, nomads do not leave many traces, but when the Scythians buried their dead they took care to equip the corpse with the essentials they thought they needed for the perpetual rides of the afterlife. They usually dug a deep hole and built a wooden structure at the bottom. For important people these resembled log cabins that were lined and floored with dark felt \u2013 the roofs were covered with layers of larch, birch bark and moss. Within the tomb chamber, the body was placed in a log trunk coffin, accompanied by some of their prized possessions and other objects. Outside the tomb chamber but still inside the grave shaft, they placed slaughtered horses, facing east.\nWOAH!

These frozen tombs remarkably preserved mummified warriors and horses, but also clothes and fabrics, food and weapons, and spectacular gold jewellery.\nMany fascinating examples will be on display in the exhibition, and here are a few of my highlights.\nGold belt plaque\nScythians with horses under a tree. Gold belt plaque. Siberia, 4th\u20133rd century BC. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017.

One half of a symmetrical belt buckle, it would undoubtedly have belonged to Scythian nobility, perhaps royalty. Gold was associated with the sun and royal power.\nThe scene shows a deceased man, a female deity with a high ponytail (left), a tree of life in which a quiver hangs, and a man holding two horses\u2019 reins. When a Scythian man wanted to marry, he hung his quiver before the woman\u2019s wagon. The scene may refer to a symbolic marriage between the deceased and the \u2018Great Mother\u2019 \u2013 a giver of life who is also associated with underworld powers. Their sacred union was essential to the death and renewal of all living things.\nFalse beard\nFalse beard.\u00a0Mound 2, Pazyryk, Altai mountains, southern Siberia, late 4th\u2013early 3rd century BC. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017. Photo: V Terebenin.\nThis false beard was found beneath a chieftain\u2019s body at Pazyryk, a Scythian burial site in the Altai mountains where the permafrost has kept organic matter astonishingly well preserved. It is made of human hair sewn on to a strap and originally tied at the back. It had been dyed a dark chestnut colour. Greek and Achaemenid Persian depictions of Scythians usually show them as bearded, yet all of the mummies found in Pazyryk were clean-shaven. It is possible these false beards had a ritual role in the funeral.\nMale headgear\nMan\u2019s headgear and illustration showing how it may have been worn.\u00a0Burial mound 2, Pazyryk, Altai mountains, southern Siberia.\u00a0Late 4th\u2013early 3rd century BC. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017.

It may have been worn by the Pazyryk chieftain in his final battle, as the damage to it corresponds with the fatal wounds on the man\u2019s head. The carving depicts the head of a fantastic eagle, holding a deer head in its beak, with figures carrying geese on either side. These elements were part of a complex headgear which consisted of a decorated felt cap topped with an elaborate wooden crest.\nCollapsible table\nCollapsible table.

They vary in height from 18\u201347cm but share the same feature of a tray-like oval top and four lathe-turned or hand-carved legs. The legs each had a projection (tenon) at the top which was inserted into a corresponding cavity (mortise). This and all the table tops from the same mound were coloured red with cinnabar in imitation of lacquer.\nDeer-shaped plaque\nDeer-shaped gold plaque.\u00a0Barrow 1, Kostromskaya, Kuban region.\u00a0Second half of the 7th century BC. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017.

It is made of a thick piece of sheet gold, embossed and chased, with gold loops soldered to the back. The ear and eye were probably once filled with coloured glass. The workmanship indicates a highly skilled craftsman, and the animal\u2019s lying position and the ornamental treatment of its antlers belong to what is known as Scythian \u2018animal style\u2019 art.\nMask for a horse\nHorse headgear.\u00a0Mound 1, Pazyryk, Altai.\u00a0Late 4th\u2013early 3rd century BC. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017.

Scythian horses were buried with warriors, dressed in masks and other components that transformed them into fantastic mythical animals. As hoofed griffins, they were believed to carry their rider into the afterlife. This felt and leather horse mask is topped with a ram\u2019s head with a cockerel between its horns. The peak is decorated with fish made of gold leaf.

The care taken to decorate the sole is understandable given that people sat on the ground and their soles were highly visible. The outer sole is made of leather wrapped in red cloth and decorated with pyrite crystals, which are perforated with holes less than a millimetre across. The craftsmanship that allowed for the precise drilling of these dense crystals is astonishing. Leather \u2018duck\u2019 shapes covered with gold foil were sewn along the seam connecting the toe with the calf. The toe is stitched with thick sinew wrapped with a tin foil which imitates silver.\nDecorated leather bag containing lumps of cheese\nBag containing cheese.\u00a0Mound 2, Pazyryk, Altai mountains, southern Siberia, late 4th\u2013early 3rd century BC. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017.

This bag was found with the horse burials\u00a0at Pazyryk and presumably had been attached to one of the saddles. It contained very well-preserved lumps of cheese. So far, analysis has not determined the source of the milk from which it had been made \u2013 cow, yak, sheep or goat milk could have been used and even mixed, as locals still did up to the mid-20th century.\nPlaque with a hare hunt\nGold plaque with hare hunt.\u00a0Kul\u2019 Oba, northern Black Sea region, first half of the 4th century BC. \u00a9 The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, 2017.

I am fascinated by East Asian painting and Japanese conservation techniques, so I could not believe my luck when I got accepted on a student placement at the British Museum\u2019s Hirayama Studio. On my first day here in September 2016, I discovered a lovely place with traditional wooden furniture and tatami mats, and such a warm atmosphere thanks to an amazing team who welcomed me with open arms.\nPanoramic view of the Hirayama Studio.\nAs is traditional in Japan, my apprenticeship began under the watchful eye of my scrollmounting sensei (teacher), Kyoko Kusunoki, whom I call Kyoko-san. My first tasks included preparing starch paste and making scrolls of paper to be used for future linings.\nPreparing the wooden lattice before pasting papers onto it.\nThe paste is made by mixing wheat starch powder with water which is then cooked on a fire stove. Lining paintings on paper and silk helps to protect, preserve and enable their safe display. A sheet of paper is pasted on the reverse of the artwork because the paper and silk are often too thin and fragile to be exposed and manipulated just by themselves.\nMisu paper made from kozo fibres mixed with calcium carbonate (a powder made of oyster shell). This is used for the second and third lining layers.\nI then went on to assist with treatments of panels from a folding screen painted by Kawamura Bunpo (1779\u20131821). This was part of the Cooperative Project to Conserve Japanese Paintings in the British Museum Collection, sponsored by the Sumitomo Foundation, in partnership with the Association for Conservation of National Treasures of Japan. My job was to remove lining papers from older silk fabrics placed on the edges of the panels.\nUsing uchibake (beating brush) to ensure lining paper and calligraphy bond properly.\nThe Hirayama Studio, is a special environment to get a taste of Japanese mounting. As part of my placement, Kyoko-san taught me about the structure of a folding screen and a hanging scroll. In October 2016, I met another Japanese scrollmounter, Aya Matoba, from Bunkazaihozon studio in Nara. She came to the Hirayama Studio to advise and finish the mounting of the painting Standing Courtesan Reading a Letter by Kitagawa Utamaro (1753\u20131806), as part of the Cooperative Project.\nKitagawa Utamaro (1753\u20131806), Standing Courtesan Reading a Letter. \u00a0Hanging scroll. Edo, Japan, 1805\u20131806.\nBig remounting projects like this are really impressive and are only rarely undertaken outside Japan. The Japanese conservation process takes a long time, and the final steps can be quite stressful as they are the culmination of a process that sometimes takes up to two years. This is in contrast to the conservation mounting process of western art, which doesn\u2019t need long drying breaks between stages.\nOnce every part of the mount fabric is attached together to the artwork and the whole mount has the final backing, the hanging scroll is almost finished. A wooden stave is attached to the top and a roller to the bottom, allowing a perfect hanging of the painting and a good support for rolling it up. The Japanese term for hanging scroll, kakejiku (\u639b\u8ef8), actually refers to these wooden parts, with kake meaning \u2018hanging\u2019, and jiku meaning \u2018axis\u2019.\nBefore attaching the top stave and roller, Kyoko wrote some information on the roller for the next conservators to conserve the painting. Who knows when they might read it? Perhaps over a hundred years from now\u2026\nAya then attached two knobs called jiku one at each end, made of lacquered wood. Finally, the top stave and roller were attached between the final backing and the lined fabrics on the top and bottom of the artwork.\nTop left: Aya Matoba attaching jiku on the roller. Bottom left: Aya Matoba preparing bottom edge of the mount before attaching the roller. Right: Aya Matoba cutting excess of lining paper to reveal edges of the silk fabric.\nThe finishing took more than a whole day \u2013 it is hard work requiring extreme concentration and precision. I was suitably impressed by this carefully choreographed ceremony. As you can see in the photo, I was really close to the action, not wishing to miss any of the detail!\nAya Matoba cutting away the excess lining paper to reveal edges of the silk fabric.\nIt has been such a privilege for me to be able to work in the Hirayama Studio. I have had the opportunity to see and do so much \u2013 I couldn\u2019t have expected better. I hope that this placement is a first step into a rewarding and exciting profession \u2013 and perhaps even an apprenticeship in Japan."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/conserving-durers-triumphal-arch-getting-the-big-picture/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "Conserving D\u00fcrer\u2019s Triumphal Arch: Getting the big picture", "author": "Sam Taylor, Paper Conservator and Agnieszka Depta, Conservator, Western Art on Paper", "timestamp": "2017-05-21 00:00:00", "text": "Once we had finished washing all of the sheets (which you can read about in the previous blog) we laid them out to get an impression of what the print looked like as a whole. A few sheets were then singled out for more cleaning due to ingrained dirt. Having established a tradition of experimenting with unusual tools, we used very fine cosmetic brushes (intended for cleaning nose pores on humans) that are softer than a squirrel\u2019s tail.\nConservators Jude Rayner, Caroline Barry and Sam Taylor comparing sheets of the Triumphal Arch.\nThe washing process presented a good opportunity to reduce some of the creases by gently brushing the wet sheets flat between thin, non-woven polyester layers. At this point it was important to make the distinction between creases that were created during the original printing process (those ones got to stay) and to focus on flattening the ones that happened while being handled or lined in the past.\nRe-sizing one of the sheets.\nTo help strengthen the paper after washing and to make sure it is fit for study and viewing for at least a century, we applied a sizing solution through protective tissue with a soft goat\u2019s hair brush, ensuring an even application.\nFinally, it was time to carry out some repairs. Simple tears were repaired with Japanese tissue and wheat starch paste. Losses and skinned areas were repaired with a technique called pulp infilling. We used white pure cotton paper with small amounts of blue, yellow and red-dyed paper in precisely weighed out proportions to create an off-white paper that matched the tone of the original sheets.\nDyed paper and colour chart. Photo \u00a9Alan Buchannan.\nIn keeping with our practice of using unusual tools, we used a nasal aspirator to apply the pulp. This was done on a suction table, which pulls the water from the pulp through a smooth, porous sheet, leaving a latticework of fibres behind, magically transforming into strong paper upon drying. To add to the atmosphere, most of this work was carried out in the dark in order to see how uniformly the pulp was being applied in the faint glow of the suction table\u2019s transmitted light.\nApplying paper pulp.\nA print of this size won\u2019t be strong enough to support its own weight when hung vertically, so we needed to give the sheets some extra support by lining them. Choosing the right paper to line a print with is an important decision; we wanted a paper that would compare favourably with the quality of the 500-year-old paper commissioned by Emperor Maximilian I. It also has to give the right amount of support and, as it will be in contact with the Triumphal Arch for a century or more, we have to make sure it won\u2019t be damaging in the long term \u2013 unlike the previous textile lining (you can watch a video of the old lining being removed here).\nJapanese papers are often used by Western conservators, as we admire their strength due to the long fibres in the paper. Luckily for us, we have our own expert in Japanese papermaking at the British Museum: Megumi Mizumura. With her advice we chose a very strong but light, handmade paper that is free from the impurities that make many types of paper deteriorate, and placed a special order with a traditional papermaker in Japan.\nAs we were using Japanese paper, it seemed sensible to consult the experts on how to apply the lining. The Museum has a studio specially designed for conserving East Asian works of art on paper and silk: the Hirayama Studio. Conservator Kyoko Kusunoki joined the Museum last year\u00a0and was kind enough to give us training in the some of the specialist techniques used in lining Japanese scroll paintings. Working in the Hirayama Studio takes a bit of getting used to: there\u2019s the Tatami mat flooring which requires working without shoes (note to self: wear best socks), and a lot of kneeling, as Japanese workbenches are low-level.\nConservators Kyoko Kusunoki and Sam Taylor lining in the Hirayama Studio.\nOnce we got the hang of it, we set to work applying the techniques we had learned to lining the Triumphal Arch with the selected paper. The Japanese method involves applying a thin layer of wheat starch paste with a special brush and lifting the now wet paper with the aid of a stick. As with many Japanese techniques there is a particular way of holding the stick, which I kept forgetting \u2013 I managed to memorise the correct position by imagining I was looking at my watch. Positioning the paper is tricky, as is brushing down the lining paper without getting any wrinkles, requiring no small degree of coordination. Holding the stick at the right angle with the left hand and brushing with the right hand, is as difficult as patting your head while rubbing your belly.\nAfter applying the lining paper, we left the lined sheets to dry under a cosy felt blanket to keep them flat, and once they were dry we trimmed off the excess lining paper. As we had recorded which edges were overlapping, we could trim the lining paper so that it won\u2019t show when it\u2019s reassembled.\nTrimming the lining paper.\nThe sheets will be stored individually until such time as it will be reassembled. We couldn\u2019t resist seeing what they looked like en masse, so to mark the end of this stage of the project we asked Melanie Malherbe, a member of the Museum\u2019s broadcast team to film us laying the sheets out on benches in the studio, but putting the jigsaw back together again properly will be a whole new story!"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-frome-hoard-and-its-impact/", "category": "News", "title": "The Frome Hoard voted top Treasure", "author": "Sam Moorhead, Finds Adviser, Portable Antiquities Scheme, British Museum", "timestamp": "2017-05-21 00:00:00", "text": "When working with the Portable Antiquities Scheme\u00a0(PAS), the concept of a \u2018forward job plan\u2019 is somewhat laughable \u2013 your work patterns are largely dictated by finds made by detectorists.

When he realised that he had found a coin hoard, he made one of the most important decisions of his life \u2013 he filled the hole in, walked away, and contacted his local PAS Finds Liaison Officer for Wiltshire, Katie Hinds. Katie contacted her opposite number in Somerset, Anna Booth, and a professional excavation of the site took place under the direction of local archaeologist Alan Graham.\nSection drawing by Alan Graham and Anna Booth.\nI first heard about the hoard when Katie rang me up in London. When she gave me the diameter of the pot (45cm) I immediately knew that we had a \u2018monster\u2019 hoard of tens of thousands of coins. We agreed that the pot should be excavated in layers \u2013 this took two days and resulted in 60 separate bags from specific parts of the pot. Roger Bland (then Head of the PAS) and I collected the coins the day afterwards and drove them back to the British Museum where they were immediately entrusted to Pippa Pearce, Senior Metals Conservator, who gave them all a \u2018wash and dry\u2019 to stabilise them. We quickly ascertained that the coins weighed 160kg, and six weeks later Pippa pronounced a total of 52,503, making the find the second largest Roman hoard in Britain. Roger and I, with assistance from colleagues, then took twelve weeks to sort the coins by emperors. The coins spanned from c. AD 250 to 290 and covered about 30 rulers, terminating with Carausius, a renegade emperor who ruled in Britain from 286 to 293.\nPippa Pearce, Senior Metals Conservator, drying coins.\nAt the same time we were working with Steve Minnitt at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton to plan a campaign for his museum to acquire the coins. With the BBC we mounted a major publicity campaign, numerous media outlets subsequently covering the story, we put on a display of some of the coins in the British Museum, we were filmed for TV series\u00a0Digging for Britain, we wrote a short introductory book (in ten days flat) and started to negotiate with the Art Fund in Somerset. After numerous events in Frome and elsewhere, \u00a3320,000 was raised to acquire the hoard, the Headley Trust and National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF) and the Art Fund making enormous contributions. Dave Crisp and the landowner, following the statutory requirements of the Treasure Act, shared the money.\nLeft: Radiate coin of Aurelian (r.

A wide range of numismatists have helped to catalogue the hoard, notably Richard Abdy, Eleanor Ghey, Vincent Drost, Andrew Brown and Fernando Lopez-Sanchez, and we are now down to a few thousand coins of Claudius II. I have catalogued, with the assistance of Graham Barker, the 850 plus coins of Carausius which contain a host of new types and varieties \u2013 fortuitous because I had just been tasked to write a new edition of the Roman Imperial Coinage for Carausius and his successor Allectus. The Frome coins also suggest to me that enigmatic coins of Carausius marked with a \u2018C\u2019 were struck at his court, wherever it happened to be \u2013 the location of this mint has exercised scholars since the days of antiquarian and archaeology pioneer\u00a0William Stukeley (1687\u20131765).\nSilver denarius of Carausius (r. AD 286\u2013293).\nThe hoard was buried on high ground which could be quite boggy after rain, suggesting a spring in the vicinity. This led me to believe from the outset that this hoard was probably a ritual deposit rather than a cache buried for recovery. When we discovered that the latest coins in the hoard were in fact halfway down the pot, it was clear that the pot was placed in the ground and then filled from a selection of smaller containers \u2013 I had visions of a local community making a communal offering. A reconstruction painting by Victor Ambrus, of Time Team fame, showed the possible scenario. However, my suggestions led to a number of quite aggressive emails from across the globe which did not subscribe to my ritual theory.\nA reconstruction painting of Sam\u2019s theory by Victor Ambrus.\n\u00a9 Victor Ambrus.\nBecause of the debate generated about the reason for the burial of the hoard, Roger Bland and I thought that a deeper study of Romano-British coin hoards might attract research funding. Partnering with Professors Colin Haselgrove and David Mattingly at Leicester University we were able to secure funding for a three-year project from the Arts and Humanities Research Council. The monograph for this project is in preparation, but I can tell you that the Frome Hoard was indeed buried by an ancient watercourse. Furthermore, it does seem that a number of other hoards were buried for ritual reasons. The project has resulted in all Iron Age and Roman coin hoards ever found in Britain being entered on the PAS database and these records will soon be made available to the public.\nSome of the coins from the hoard.\nDave Crisp\u2019s decision to leave the hoard in the ground has had an enormous impact on other metal detectorists\u2019 practices. Several coin hoards have been excavated professionally since 2010 and many have been retained in their pot for us to excavate at the British Museum. It will be probably the most important legacy of Dave\u2019s discovery and one for which he deserves enormous credit.\nDave Crisp with a selection of coins from the Frome Hoard.\nFinally, the hoard was the catalyst for a schools\u2019 activity run from the Samsung Digital Discovery Centre. Children are able to take the roles of finders, curators, marketing staff and other people involved in the Frome Hoard story, and it has proven very popular.\nThe Frome Hoard has had an enormous impact on the life of Dave Crisp, but also on the lives of archaeologists, curators, university academics, conservators, schoolchildren and the general public. We hope that many of these experiences can be encapsulated in the final publication which we will start to work on when the cataloguing is finally completed.\nSam\u2019s 2010 book\u00a0The Frome Hoard is out of print but still available.\nFind out\u00a0more about Treasure 20 on the Portable Antiquities Scheme website.\nYou can view more images of the Frome Hoard on Flickr\u00a0or see the real thing on display in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/explore-lgbtq-histories-from-very-ancient-times-to-the-present-day/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Stories for equality", "author": "Stuart Frost, Head of Interpretation & Volunteers and Andrew Shore", "timestamp": "2017-05-17 00:00:00", "text": "In the UK almost 50 years ago \u2013 on 27 July 1967 \u2013 the Sexual Offences Act received royal assent.

However, developing the exhibition has been a collaborative process involving countless colleagues from across the organisation.

Dating from around 9000 BC, it represents the earliest known depiction of a couple having sex. The lovers are usually interpreted as a heterosexual couple. However on close inspection, the sculpture poses the question, should we make that assumption so easily? The genders of both figures are ambiguous, and the sculpture itself overall has a phallic character. The sculpture reminds us that we should not impose heterosexuality \u2013 or our own attitudes \u2013 unquestioningly onto the past.\nThe Museum\u2019s collection does not represent all perspectives and experiences equally.\u00a0 This partly reflects biases within cultures and societies, what has survived and what has been collected.

A trail highlighting 14 key objects in the permanent galleries is an integral part of the display, creating an exhibition that is actually dispersed throughout the Museum building rather than being contained in one location. The trail includes star objects like the Warren Cup, as well as lesser known objects such as chocolate cups and saucers belonging to the \u2018Ladies of Llangollen\u2019. We\u2019ve developed a graphic approach for these objects that give us enough space to be able to tell these objects\u2019 stories meaningfully. Can\u2019t make it to the Museum? You can explore a digital version of the trail here.\nThe objects highlighted in the exhibition and trail have been included because the subject, maker or owner has an LGBTQ connection or has been adopted by the LGBTQ community. There are numerous other objects that we could have included and many other selections and juxtapositions are possible. Our main aim with the trail objects was to make a selection that most people would be able to visit during a single one-off visit, one that wasn\u2019t too challenging in terms of navigating across the Museum site, and one that was as representative as it is possible to be with only 14 objects.\nCan\u2019t visit the Museum?

This was equivalent to 10 May 1849 in London. He was 90 years old by traditional reckoning. In Japan at the time, people were considered to be one at birth and their age increased by another year at each New Year, so Hokusai would have been 89 by western reckoning.\nKatsushika Hokusai (1760\u20131849),\u00a0Head of an old man.

Hokusai\u2019s last words were recorded as follows: \u2018If heaven will extend my life by ten more years\u2026\u2019 then, after a pause, \u2018If heaven will afford me five more years of life, then I\u2019ll manage to become a true artist.\u2019\nEijo rapidly brushed a note to inform Hokusai\u2019s pupil Hokushin that her father had just passed away: \u2018Manji [Hokusai] was ill and treatment was to no avail. He died from his illness early this morning at the seventh hour [about 04.00]. I wanted quickly to inform you of this situation.\u2019 She then added in smaller characters next to the name of the addressee: \u2018Funeral tomorrow, 19th day, fourth hour [about 10.00].\u2019\nThe first important biography of Hokusai, Katsushika Hokusai den of 1893 by Iijima Kyoshin, described the funeral. In an interview with Yomo no Umehiko (1822\u20131896) he recalled that Hokusai\u2019s pupils and old friends contributed funds for a funeral with a modest coffin. About a hundred mourners proceeded to the mortuary temple Seiky\u014dji, including samurai with retainers carrying spears and lacquered travelling boxes. This was unheard of for the funeral of someone living in the backstreets of the commoner districts of Edo and people in the neighbourhood were envious. Hokusai\u2019s grave is still carefully maintained at Seiky\u014dji today.\nKatsushika Hokusai (1760\u20131849), Clear day with a southern breeze (Red Fuji) from Thirty-Six Views of Mt Fuji. Colour woodblock, 1831.\nHokusai\u2019s fervent belief was that the older he got the greater his art would become. In 1834, when he was 75, he famously stated the following in a postscript to volume one of his extraordinary illustrated book One Hundred Views of Mt Fuji (Fugaku hyakkei):\n\u2018\u2026until the age of 70, nothing I drew was worthy of notice. At 73 years I was somewhat able to fathom the growth of plants and trees, and the structure of birds, animals, insects and fish. Thus when I reach 80 years, I hope to have made increasing progress, and at 90 to see further into the underlying principles of things, so that at 100 years I will have achieved a divine state in my art, and at 110, every dot and every stroke will be as though alive.

By making various impressions, artists were able to produce multiple versions of one work.\nFrom the 1960s onwards, printmaking transformed the American art scene. Artists from Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg to Jim Dine, Kara Walker and Ed Ruscha embraced techniques and experimented with different materials to create extraordinary works of art.\nJim Dine (b. 1935), Five Paintbrushes (sixth state). Etching, aquatint and drypoint in black-green ink on Murillo paper,\u00a01973. \u00a9 Jim Dine. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nPrintmaking brought their work to a much wider and more diverse audience. Their sheer inventiveness and technical ingenuity reflects America\u2019s power and influence during this period. Until 18 June 2017, you can see a selection\u00a0on display in the exhibition The American Dream: pop to the present.\nBut how do artists actually create these astonishing pieces? Below you can watch three key printing processes, demonstrated by students from University of the Arts (UAL), London.\nScreenprint (also called silkscreen)\nIn screenprinting, a mesh is attached to a frame to form a screen, and a stencil, made of cut paper or film, or a photographically developed film of gelatine, is fixed to the mesh, masking it in some places and leaving it open elsewhere for the passage of ink. To make a print, a sheet of paper is placed underneath the frame, and ink is forced through the screen with a rubber blade known as a squeegee. Most screenprints use multiple screens to build up colour.\nScreenprinting is one of the most popular forms of printmaking techniques. Andy Warhol (1928\u20131987) famously used the process. He said: \u2018I want to be a machine, and I feel that whatever I do and do machine-like is what I want to do.\u2019\nEtching\nTo create an etching a needle is used to draw freely through a hard, waxy acid-resistant ground covering the metal plate. The exposed metal is then \u2018bitten\u2019 by acid, creating the lines. This is done by immersing the plate in an acid bath. The longer the acid bites, the deeper the lines become. The paper is then pressed onto the plate and absorbs the image in reverse.\nWhen Jim Dine began to explore etching in 1964, the subject he chose was the bathrobe, a motif which served as a surrogate of the artist\u2019s persona. This representation of the self through various motifs \u2013 bathrobes, hearts, brushes \u2013 is echoed in his feelings\u00a0on the practice: \u2018I have a real romance with printing. The passion I feel for the way printers can wipe a plate and use ink in the sensitive way to illuminate what I\u2019ve drawn is really a privilege.\u2019\nLithography\nAn image is drawn on the printing surface, usually stone or zinc plates, with a greasy medium (\u2018lithography\u2019 literally means \u2018stone writing\u2019). The printing surface is then dampened so that when greasy ink is applied it will stick only to the drawn image and will be repelled by water covering the rest of the stone or plate. The ink is transferred to a sheet of paper by passing paper and printing surface together through a flat-bed scraper press.\nRobert Rauschenberg (1925\u20132008), initially sceptical about printmaking, produced some of the most important lithographs ever made, including the remarkable\u00a0Stoned Moon series\u00a0(1969\u20131970), on display in the exhibition.\nToday, artists continue to experiment with the expressive potential of printmaking to respond to the world around them. Whether it\u2019s the physical process, the feeling of being part of a long tradition, or the aesthetic end result that attracts artists, printmaking continues to flourish in its many forms.\nThe exhibition\u00a0The American Dream: pop to the present\u00a0runs at the Museum until\u00a018 June 2017.\nSponsored by Morgan Stanley.\nSupported by the Terra Foundation for American Art.\nBuy the book to explore\u00a0the unprecedented scale, boldness and ambition of American printmaking since the 1960s.\nYou can also browse\u00a0a range of products inspired by the works\u00a0in the exhibition, including a range of prints.\nUAL, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year, is a global top 6 university for Art and Design made up of six world-renowned colleges: Camberwell College of Arts, Central Saint Martins, Chelsea College of Arts, London College of Communication, London College of Fashion and Wimbledon College of Arts."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/south-asia-season-2017/", "category": "News", "title": "South Asia season 2017", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2017-05-03 00:00:00", "text": "As part of the season, British Museum objects will travel across the UK, including:\na spotlight tour of an important sculpture of the elephant-headed god Ganesha\na spotlight loan to UK venues themed on the music of courtly India\nan Object Journeys display at Manchester Museum\nthe continuing development of the South Asia partnership gallery at Manchester Museum, a joint project with the British Museum\na long-term loan to Greenway House in Devon\na long-term loan to the Oriental Museum in Durham\nThe season continues at the British Museum from August, including a display in Room 3 of an important sculpture from the Buddhist monument at Amaravati in southern India, and a display in Room 90a of recently acquired 20th-century popular prints from India.\nRoom 33 before refurbishment.\nIn November 2017, the British Museum\u2019s Sir Joseph Hotung Gallery of China and South Asia (Room 33) will reopen to the public after a complete refurbishment and redisplay.\u00a0The new display will include a new narrative for South Asia which will bring the story up to the present day.

The two-sided limestone relief features the Buddha as a symbolic empty throne on one side, carved in the 1st century BC. The reverse side features a Buddha standing in front of the shrine, carved in the 3rd century AD. The shrine at Amaravati was founded about 200 BC probably to house a relic of the Buddha. It was slowly abandoned sometime during the 14th century.

Shiva is depicted crushing ignorance underfoot while ushering out one cycle of existence and dancing in a new one. Another important statue on display will be of the Buddhist goddess Tara. Made in Sri Lanka, the statue combines both the spiritual and sensual, and would have been used as a focal point for meditation on the qualities of Tara \u2013\u00a0mercy and compassion.

It was designed by artist Katsushika Hokusai in around 1831 and issued as a popular colour woodblock print. Since then it has inspired countless reimaginings.\nEast meets west in the Great Wave\nSometimes, it\u2019s all about perspective. Although the Great Wave is often seen as typically Japanese, in fact it mixes influences from both east and west. Hokusai\u2019s imagination had been captured in his youth by his discovery of European-style perspective. Now, aged about 70, he adapted European perspective in a very inventive way, playing games in the image.\nMount Fuji is dwarfed by the wave\nKatsushika Hokusai (1760\u20131849), Under the Wave off Kanagawa.

Also, look closer and you\u2019ll see\u00a0fishermen in boats, about to be swamped by the sea!\nIt originally cost the same as two helpings of noodles!\nAt the time it was made, a print of the wave would be worth no more than two helpings of noodles. The series was so commercially successful that the publisher extended it with another ten prints, printed this time with black instead of blue outlines. Several thousand impressions were taken of the design from the cherry-wood printing blocks, literally as many as the publisher could sell. The British Museum has several impressions of the Great Wave, including this fine early impression.\nHokusai used a brand new colour in this work\nThe colours Hokusai used in printing the Great Wave are significant, particularly the blue. It comes from Berlin and is called Prussian Blue.\nPrussian Blue in a detail of Hokusai\u2019s Great Wave.\nThe print series was the first to exploit the new pigment, which had recently become cheaply available from China. It provided Hokusai with a strong blue for both sky and water and had the added advantage that it did not fade. Its use also made the print extremely popular in Japan, as the Japanese were very enthusiastic about anything that came from somewhere \u2018exotic\u2019 like Europe.\nIt has influenced other forms of art too\nCover of the first edition of Debussy\u2019s La Mer. A Durand and Sons, 1905. Photo: DEA/G DAGLI ORTI/De Agostini/Getty Images.\nIt\u2019s well known that many western artists were inspired by Hokusai, from Monet, Van Gogh and Degas to Whistler, Warhol and Hockney. French composer Claude Debussy (1862\u20131918) was inspired to write his own ode to the sea, titled \u2018La Mer\u2019. The cover of the 1905 edition of this orchestral work featured an illustration based on Hokusai\u2019s wave.\nThe internet has only made it more popular\nCookie Monster Great Wave. \u00a9 reddit.com user Put_It_All_On_Red.\nThe wave is so visually familiar that it has been adapted to feature in a series of memes, from pugs to Godzilla.

How can we learn from the long-term movements of people, often against all odds? It is through this study of people over time and across the globe, that we learn more about the impact of migration and people\u2019s ability to adapt to and shape a new world.\u2019 \u00a0\u2013\u00a0Hartwig Fischer, Director\u00a0of the British Museum\nSadik Kwaish Alfraji (b. 1960), pages from Ali\u2019s Boat 1.

Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nHW: When the project team first discussed the theme of migration as a focus for this display, we wanted to select objects from across the Museum to represent elements of this vast experience. I spoke to you, Venetia, at that point to try and find objects that could talk about the emotional experience of migration. One of the objects selected by the Director was Ali\u2019s Boat an artist\u2019s book by Sadik Kwaish Alfraji. When did you first encounter Sadik\u2019s work?\nVP: We acquired Ali\u2019s Boat in 2015, I had heard about Sadik\u2019s work before, but I was mostly familiar with his videos and so when I found out that these were based on drawings and artist books I wanted to learn more. When I saw Ali\u2019s Boat I fell in love with it immediately, it felt like a really appropriate acquisition. All of Sadik\u2019s work is bound up in his own history, his relationship with his country, his past and his family \u2013 it\u2019s so personal. As well as being existential and universal. That is what is magical about this book. It is drawn in a childlike way, and emphasises the fragility of the subject. When we first spoke about the Moving stories display in February 2017, Sadik and I had actually just reconnected. He is included in the Ruya Foundation\u2019s Iraq Pavilion at this year\u2019s Venice Biennale and I was writing an essay about the work he is presenting there. Then when the Director asked if we could display the work as a set of prints as well, I contacted Sadik and his gallery, Ayyam, directly to ask about their availability.\nHW: The entire display was produced in a very short time frame. It felt like such an urgent topic for us to discuss, and it is relevant in so many different ways. You discussed the universality of Sadik\u2019s approach to his art, is there a key element of the work that you wanted to highlight in this display?\nVP: What is so poignant about this work is that it is a meditation on the theme of migration and exile\u2026 It\u2019s very sad actually. Sadik left Iraq in 1990 and returned for the first time in 2009. The book is inspired by a letter from his nephew Ali.\n\u2018The morning I left Baghdad, he handed me a sealed envelope, which he asked me not to open till I returned home to the Netherlands.\n\u2018I kept my promise, and I only opened his nicely decorated envelope when I reached home with my family. In it was a letter with the names of my children and his own name. In the middle was a drawing of a little canoe-like boat with one simple sentence \u201cI wish this drawing takes me to you.\u201d\n\u2018One simple, honest sentence and a boat, which held his dreams\u2026 As if he hoped that these words and that letter, if opened in the right place, at the right time, would perform a kind of magic, his own Abracadabra or Open Sesame, which would take him far away just the way he used to go on this boat in his dreams. His letter in a sealed envelope was his attempt to escape reality, with a boat and a few words, to a strange world of fantasy.\u2019 \u2013\u00a0Sadik Kwaish\u00a0Alfraji\nThe text is written in the form of a letter to Ali: \u2018I was like you Ali\u2026I had a boat\u2026 it was the colour of dreams and it was studded with lapis lazuli\u2019. But he warns: \u2018Ali this boat will lead to delusion after delusion after darkness.\u2019\nAli\u2019s note with the drawing of a boat that inspired his uncle, the artist Sadik Kwaish Alfraji, to create Ali\u2019s Boat diary five years later. \u00a9 Sadik Kwaish Alfraji. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nHW: It\u2019s an incredibly moving art work, and we were able to compare it with two other journeys within the display; the Happisburgh footprints, and the film One World in Relation of the poet and philosopher \u00c9douard Glissant. Nick Ashton, Curator for Palaeolithic Collections, explained that \u2018Happisburgh tells of a metaphoric journey where people have crossed the natural boundaries of their known world. It is a story of survival in a harsh environment, but also one of opportunity.\u2019 Glissant too talks about these same experiences in One World in Relation, and it is not only the trauma of diaspora communities but also the transformations that occur that link all three together.\nVP: Exactly. Sadik\u2019s story is so personal, it\u2019s about one person and yet it\u2019s also an allegory. It speaks to the footprints and the deep history of human movement, and that same hope.\nOn Saturday 22 April 2017, 11.00\u201316.00 there will be\u00a0free drop-in performances and activities inspired by the themes in the current Asahi Shimbun Display Moving stories: three journeys.

Photo: Peter Reavill.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that a lot of people are excited and intrigued by the discovery of the so-called \u2018Piano Hoard\u2019. We grow up with stories of hidden treasures and the brave or lucky people that find them, and it can be appealing to imagine ourselves in their places. The Piano Hoard story has the added excitement that it\u2019s relatively recent\u00a0\u2013 this is not a long-buried assemblage of war booty or grave goods, but a large sum of money hidden in plain sight less than 100 years ago. So what happened to the original owner and why was the hoard hidden in the first place?\nFirst, to take a step back, it should be explained that despite its adopted title the Piano Hoard is not a collection of musical instruments(!) but rather a group of 913 gold sovereigns and half-sovereigns found stashed under the keyboard of a Broadwood & Sons upright piano, made in 1906. Martin Backhouse had been asked by the piano\u2019s owners, the Bishop\u2019s Castle Community College, to tune the newly acquired instrument and in the course of doing so he removed the keys and noticed seven cloth-wrapped parcels in spaces which should have been empty. Looking inside one, he noticed the gold coins and immediately informed the school. The school, knowing they hadn\u2019t put the coins there, then in turn contacted HM Coroner for Shropshire, John Ellery, as required by law under the Treasure Act 1996.\nThe piano in which the hoard was discovered, donated to the school by Mr and Mrs Hemmings. Photo: Peter Reavill.\nThis sequence of events often perplexes people, who usually associate coroners with investigations into sudden and suspicious deaths (which in truth is a major part of their role). But in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, coroners also act as the Crown\u2019s representative in cases of potential \u2018Treasure\u2019, a legal term defined by the Treasure Act (Scotland has a separate law of Treasure Trove).\nIt is also why you are reading about the Piano Hoard in a British Museum blog. The British Museum acts as the Treasure Registry for all finds of potential Treasure from England, and performs the secretarial work for the Treasure Valuation Committee (TVC), an independent body that recommends values for Treasure finds to the Secretary of State. Furthermore, the British Museum coordinates the Portable Antiquities Scheme\u00a0(PAS), a network of regional Finds Liaison Officers (FLOs) who record archaeological finds discovered by the public on a free-to-use database.\nImportantly for this story, FLOs also support coroners in their Treasure work, and the FLO for Shropshire and Herefordshire, Peter Reavill, has been heavily involved in this case. Peter took receipt of the parcels from the school and carefully opened them all, looking for clues about their owner and meticulously cataloguing the coins.\nFinds Liaison Officer Peter Reavill recording part of the \u2018Piano Hoard\u2019. \u00a9 Portable Antiquities Scheme/The Trustees of the British Museum. Photo: Emily Freeman.\nThe point of the Treasure Act is to ensure that important archaeological finds are reported, allowing everyone to benefit from the knowledge of their discovery, and to allow public collections (museums) the opportunity to acquire them. If a coroner agrees that a find meets the criteria for Treasure, then it belongs to the Crown, who may place it in an appropriate museum, with the finder and landowner being rewarded financially.\nMost reported Treasure\u00a0meets the criteria by being more than 300 years old, made of gold or silver, or constitutes a group of coins more than 300 years old or prehistoric base metal. \u00a0Over 1,000 discoveries\u00a0of this type are reported and logged by the British Museum every year, and hundreds acquired by museums, enriching our culture and increasing our understanding of the past.\nPart of the hoard. \u00a9 Portable Antiquities Scheme/The Trustees of the British Museum. Photo: Peter Reavill.\nBut what about the Piano Hoard? The gold coins found within it date to 1915, so are much less than 300 years old. However, the Treasure Act also stipulates that items of any age, made substantially of gold or silver, whose original owners or heirs are unknown, and which are deemed to have been deliberately hidden with the intention of recovery, are also \u2018Treasure\u2019. This was the heart of the matter for the Coroner, who had to determine whether the Piano Hoard fitted all of these criteria. In practice, very few gold and silver items that are less than 300 years old do, because either their owners or heirs are known, or it is impossible to say whether they\u2019d been hidden with the intention of recovery \u2013 most Treasure finds are thought to be chance losses.\nGold sovereign from the reign of Queen Victoria (1898 \u2013 Jubilee Bust of Victoria), from the hoard. \u00a9 Portable Antiquities Scheme/The Trustees of the British Museum. Photo: Peter Reavill.\nBut central to the Piano Hoard\u2019s story is that it certainly seems to have been put away for safekeeping. The coins are clearly made substantially of gold (the coins are all 91.7% precious metal), so the main concern for the Coroner was to investigate any information about a possible owner of the hoard or their heirs. Peter Reavill investigated leads in the archives of the piano maker, the Essex Record Office and even the Shredded Wheat company (whose packaging was found wrapped around one parcel of coins). He concluded that the coins couldn\u2019t have been hidden earlier than the late 1920s, but nothing identifying the owner of the coins was traced.\nWorking with Peter and the British Museum, the Coroner issued several press releases appealing for more information. Over 40\u00a0claimants and others came forward with information but as we now know, none could prove their claim to the Coroner\u2019s satisfaction. As such, the Coroner decided at the inquest on 20 April 2017 that the hoard met the criteria for Treasure.\nThat means that the Piano Hoard is now owned by the Crown, but that ownership is only exercised if a museum wishes to acquire all or part of the hoard. Saffron Walden Museum has expressed an interest in a small element of the hoard, as it would seem that it must have spent most of its life in that town.\nThe British Museum will now organise for the coins to be valued, first by an independent expert from the trade and then by the Treasure Valuation Committee. Saffron Walden Museum will have to pay that value to acquire the coins, with the money going to Mr Backhouse and the community college as a reward, should they wish to claim it (some rewards are waived by the finders and owners). The rest of the coins will be returned to them to do with what they will.\nSome of the key people involved talk about the Piano Hoard\u2019s discovery:\nDespite the fact that the heirs of the original owner of the coins haven\u2019t been identified, the Piano Hoard tells an intriguing story. Collections of gold and silver coins from the 19th\u00a0and 20th\u00a0centuries are not terribly unusual discoveries, and as recently as 2011 a hoard of gold sovereigns was found in a field in Twinstead, Essex. But that hoard consisted of just over 200 coins and indeed most others seem to be of similar or smaller amounts.\nThe Piano Hoard might be the largest hoard of its type found to date. It appears to have been collected over several decades and then kept safe after Britain first went off the gold standard in 1914, but it was only tucked away in the piano in the late 1920s at the earliest. Could this have been a reaction to the Depression, or events leading up to the Second World War, or to that conflict itself? What happened to the person who amassed this considerable wealth? Part of why\u00a0this discovery strikes a chord with the public is that we may never know the definite answer to these questions, and we are free to wonder.\nFind out more about the Portable Antiquities Scheme and the Treasure Act."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-day-the-mastodons-left/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "The day the mastodons left", "author": "Francesca Hillier, Museum Archivist and Andrew Shore", "timestamp": "2017-04-18 00:00:00", "text": "Natural history objects were part of the British Museum from the start, having formed a significant part of Sir Hans Sloane\u2019s founding collection. They continued to be displayed here for over 120 years, until 1881, when they began to leave for the new British Museum (Natural History) in South Kensington \u2013 known today as the world-famous Natural History Museum.\nThree giraffes and a rhinoceros on the staircase of the \u2018old\u2019 Museum, Montagu House. Watercolour drawing by George Scharf, 1845.\nHans Sloane was a physician, so had a huge interest in natural history. When he died in 1753, his collection was bequeathed to the nation, and the British Museum opened in 1759. By 1807 the Department of Natural and Artificial Productions had become large and unwieldly, so the Museum\u2019s Trustees decided to separate natural history from antiquities. Two new departments were formed \u2013 Natural History and Modern Curiosities and Antiquities. This decision coincided with the appointment of German botanist and mineralogist Charles K\u00f6nig as Assistant Keeper of the natural history collections. He was to have a significant impact on these collections until his death in 1851.\nA giraffe in the Central Saloon (now Rooms 38\u201339), with various other mammals in the cases behind. Photograph by Frederick York, 1875.\nThe natural history departments continued to grow and in July 1834 the Trustees asked the departmental officers to \u2018make full and detailed reports upon the state of the several branches of their departments\u2019. These reports showed, for example, that the minerals collection was considerable and comprised probably \u2018the most extensive anywhere exhibited to public view\u2019.\nThe zoology report stated that out of the 942 species of mammals then known, 330 were represented in the Museum. 4,109 species of bird were known and 1,831 were in the Museum. As well as exotic animals such as giraffes and rhinoceroses, the specimens also included extinct animals such as mastodons, megatherium\u00a0and giant deer. Later in the 1830s the natural history material was further subdivided into the Botanical Branch, the Mineral & Geological Branch and the Zoological Branch.\nBirds in the Eastern Zoological Gallery. Photograph by Frederick York, 1875.\nThe care and preservation of these collections then became a concern. A sub-committee for natural history was set up in 1838 and K\u00f6nig reported that there was an extreme lack of space, both for display and storage of the current collections \u2013 never mind for any future additions. New galleries had been planned in the new museum building being constructed at Bloomsbury. The natural history collections had begun to be relocated there in the 1820s but lack of space remained an issue, as well as the storage and cataloguing of material.\nThe North Geographical Gallery, showing the level of overcrowding (and a couple of giant deer). Photograph by Frederick York, 1875.\nIn 1846 a solution was suggested by Lord Egerton, later the Chairman of the Royal Commission on the Museum. He wrote to the Prime Minister, Robert Peel, proposing that fossils and similar objects should be transferred to the Royal College of Surgeons. There, he reasoned, they could be better cared for under the curation of Richard Owen (who would later be employed by the Museum \u2013 but possibly most famous today for coining the term \u2018dinosaur\u2019).\nEgerton felt the Museum should \u2018be relieved from the burden of natural history in all its branches\u2019 and options for its rehousing should be considered. This alarmed the scientific community, who wrote to the Prime Minister in 1847 to voice their concern that the promotion of the science of natural history within the Museum was inadequate, suggesting that the situation be improved. The Royal Commission, set up to investigate the Museum and how it was being run, made reference to the natural history collections, stating that they are \u2018as a whole, equal, if not superior, to any in the world.\u2019\nThe megatherium skeleton (far left) in the North Geographical Gallery (6th Room). The megatherium was an elephant-sized ground sloth that lived in South America until it became extinct about 10,000 years ago. The right of the picture shows the skeleton of a mastodon (an early relative of the elephant that lived in North and Central America and became extinct around 10,000 years ago). Photograph by Frederick York, 1875.\nIn 1856, with space still a problem, Anthony Panizzi, the newly appointed Principal Librarian (i.e. the Director), and Richard Owen, the new Superintendent of the Natural History Departments, began discussions about relocating the natural history collections.\nThey were determined to found a new museum, and favoured South Kensington as a location (just south of where the Great Exhibition took place in Hyde Park in 1851), although other sites considered included Crystal Palace (where the Great Exhibition structure had been moved to Sydenham in South London), Embankment and near Victoria Station. The option of extending the site at Bloomsbury was considered too expensive. Wrangling about the location of this new museum continued, but by 1870 the decision was made. By the end of the decade the natural history collections were being prepared for their move.\nA shark and attendant! The attendant was presumably included to show the scale of the fish. Photograph by Frederick York, 1875.\nThe mineralogical collection was first to be transferred, in 1880, followed by the geology and botanic collections. The new museum was opened, without ceremony, to the public on 18 April 1881. The zoological specimens remained at Bloomsbury until 1883 \u2013 it took 394 trips by horse and cart over 97 days to move it! Although commonly referred to as the Natural History Museum, it was officially known as the British Museum (Natural History) as late as 1992, despite legal separation from the British Museum in 1963.\nThe Museum at Bloomsbury, primarily seen by the public as a natural history one, was now to be devoted to antiquities and the library collections. Of course, in time, the library was also to become too large for the Bloomsbury building \u2013 but that\u2019s another story\u2026\nHappy Birthday to our fellow institution!

That makes it older than Napoleon (we have one of his death masks, which you should definitely check out), older than the steam locomotive, it even predates the entire industrial revolution. But my favourite thing that the Museum is older than? Sandwiches. Definitely sandwiches.\nWhy am I talking about the origin date of sandwiches in a blog about cats? Well they\u2019re related, if not immediately obviously. When you\u2019re a Museum employee, you get access to many of the areas the public aren\u2019t allowed to go into, and this is one of my favourite things about working here. Because those areas are littered with outdated signs and staff notices from the Museum\u2019s history. They frequently make little to no sense at first glance, because what they relate to has long since passed, but if you dig a little deeper, they tend to have fantastic stories attached to them. And there\u2019s one in particular that had me so purrrplexed (sorry), that I had to find out more about it. It reads:\nIn my three years of working at the Museum I\u2019ve never even seen a tin of cat food, let alone an actual cat that could be fed in an official or unofficial cat feeding area. In order to sate my cat-like curiosity I started asking some of the longer serving members of staff if they knew anything about the Museum cats.\nThey did. It turns out that between the 1970s and 1990s the Museum had between 4 and 7 cats \u2013 depending on what year we\u2019re talking about \u2013 kept to deter mice and rats.\nPippin, Maisie and Poppet\nThe Museum cats frequently featured in newspaper articles. A feature on the British Museum cats having their Christmas dinner became a worldwide sensation in the 1980s, and in 1993 the New York Times had a double page spread on how some of our cats had developed the ability to catch pigeons in mid-air. All this proved that the cat feeding sign I had witnessed wasn\u2019t an 18th-century Museum employee\u2019s idea of a practical joke, but it didn\u2019t tell me how the cats got the British Museum in the first place. That question proved a little harder to answer.\nNext I went down to the Museum\u2019s central archives where Archivist Francesca Hillier handed me a large box labelled: \u2018Cats\u2019 Welfare Society 1907\u20131993\u2019.\nThe box was filled with half-conversations, chains of internal memos that came to an abrupt halt, references to telephone calls that weren\u2019t recorded and a few newspaper clippings. It was incomplete, but workable. With a little time I started to piece together the events that seemed to lead to the official Museum cats. What I discovered was more than a little surprising.\nIt appears that the cats were not in fact invited to inhabit the Museum, but found their way to the site quite of their own accord. Sometime before 1960 a colony of stray cats (a frequent problem throughout London in the 1950s\u20131970s) found its way to the Museum and continued to breed and cause a nuisance for some 15 years. They were smelly, antisocial and at one point may have numbered over 100.\nRex the \u2018Cat Man\u2019 and Maisie\nThe Museum eventually decided to remove their feline inhabitants, and a dedicated group of volunteer staff brought the population down to just six (all through very humane means). At this point a cleaner called Rex Shepherd (who became known to staff as the Cat Man) formed the Cat Welfare Society. For the next 20 years, Rex and the Society kept the Museum cat population healthy and at a manageable number.\nThis group of cats consisted of Suzie, who spent much of her time prowling the Museum\u2019s colonnade waiting to catch pigeons in mid-air, Pippin and Poppet who could roll over on command (all you had to say was \u2018sayonara\u2019) and Wilson, named after the British Museum director Sir David Wilson (who did not like cats). The cats even became an international phenomenon thanks to the coverage they received from the media during the 1980s and 1990s. But for all that coverage, the only reason I now know anything about them is thanks to an outdated sign stuck to a wall en route to the Museum canteen.\nNo cats were harmed in the making of this podcast."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/idrimi-the-3500-year-old-refugee/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "Idrimi, the 3,500-year-old refugee", "author": "Jamie Fraser, Curator for the Ancient Levant and Anatolia", "timestamp": "2017-04-10 00:00:00", "text": "The thing I love the most about guiding visitors through the British Museum is taking them to the astonishing statue of King Idrimi. No one has ever heard of Idrimi, but, after seeing his statue, no one ever forgets.\nIdrimi was a refugee who fled Aleppo in Syria about 3,500 years ago \u2013 the same Aleppo so often in the news today. Later, as a much older man, Idrimi had this statue made of himself, with his life story written across the front, literally from head to foot. This extraordinary story is inscribed in the wedge-shaped cuneiform script of the ancient Middle East, and it is one of the earliest (and most interesting) political autobiographies ever found.\nThe Statue of Idrimi. Tell Atchana, Turkey, 16th century BC. Photo by\u00a0Tracey Howe for Making Light.\n;\nThe story of Idrimi\nIdrimi lived with his parents and six older brothers in the ancient kingdom of Aleppo. When he was a young man, a \u2018hostile incident\u2019 happened between his father and the king, so Idrimi fled with his family to his mother\u2019s hometown of Emar, on the Euphrates river. Although his older brothers were happy there, Idrimi thought that his family was not being treated well, and so he fled again to the Land of Canaan, probably in southern Lebanon.\nIn Canaan, Idrimi met another group of refugees from Aleppo, who claimed him as their leader. For the next six years, Idrimi made offerings to the storm god, Teshub, but to no avail. Finally, on the seventh year, the offerings were good. With Teshub\u2019s blessing, Idrimi built a fleet of ships, sailed up the coast, and attacked the ancient city of Alalakh, about 80km west of Aleppo, in southern Turkey. Idrimi would rule over Alalakh for the next 30 years, leading his armies against seven Hittite cities in Turkey. It is also easy to read, between the stick-like wedges of the cuneiform text, Idrimi\u2019s delight at placing his six older brothers under his protection, when they later turned to their youngest brother for help.\nIdrimi carved his statue in white magnesite limestone around 1500 BC, and he placed it inside a temple upon a black basalt throne.\nPhoto by Tracey Howe for Making Light.\nA curse\u2026and a blessing\nWhat I love most about the statue are two phrases that bracket the start and the end of the text. The last two lines curse anyone who might destroy the statue, or who is bold enough to change its text. However, the curse contrasts a blessing written in two lines down Idrimi\u2019s right cheek, almost like a cartoon speech bubble coming directly from his mouth. These lines state that Idrimi wrote his deeds upon himself for everyone to see, and those that read the text will learn from his life, and so bless Idrimi forever.\nThe blessing inscription. Photo (c) Adam Lowe, Factum Foundation.\nWhen was the statue found?\n\n\nAn invading force destroyed the city of Alalakh in about 1200 BC. The attackers found the statue, and, disregarding its curse, they removed its head and pushed the body from the throne.\nIn 1939, the famous archaeologist Leonard Woolley unearthed the basalt throne lying on the temple floor. A few days later, he discovered the statue, immediately recognising it as one of the most important Bronze Age artefacts ever discovered in the east Mediterranean world.\nIntriguingly, the statue itself had been hidden inside a pit beneath the temple floor, the severed head placed carefully alongside the body. We do not know who buried the statue, following its desecration in the city\u2019s final hours. However, I like to imagine a mysterious worshipper, now lost to history, finding the statue among the temple\u2019s smouldering ruins, and burying it within holy ground.\nWoolley sent the statue to the British Museum in June 1939. Ironically, Idrimi soon found himself hidden underground once more, this time by nervous curators protecting the collection at the outbreak of WWII.\nWhy does it matter?\nThe statue was one of the most important finds from Woolley\u2019s dig at Alalakh, and he published a photograph of the moment of its discovery in the Illustrated London News. The statue increased in fame a few years later when Idrimi\u2019s text was translated at the Museum. The inscription provides a fabulous window into the politics, geography and cultic practices of the eastern Mediterranean in the Bronze Age, seen through the eyes of King Idrimi.\nThe inscription also describes a loose alliance between Idrimi and a mysterious group of stateless wanderers called the ha-pi-ru, who lived in the Canaanite hills. This is one of the first times in history that the ha-pi-ru are named, and many archaeologists believe that they were the ancestors of the Hebrew tribes that later conquered Canaan, written in the Bible a thousand years later.\nThe discovery of Idrimi as published in the Illustrated London News, 1980.\nFor these reasons, the Idrimi inscription is listed here as one of the 20 most important cuneiform documents ever found.\nScanning Idrimi\nPhoto by Tracey Howe for Making Light.\nToday, Idrimi sits in Room 57 at the Museum. However, the statue must be kept within a glass case due to the fragile condition of the stone. Unfortunately, this means that researchers can\u2019t get close enough to study the inscription in detail. To solve this problem, we created a digital model last year that anyone can view on Sketchfab here. This model is a fantastic tool for presenting the statue online. However, it is not at a high enough resolution for cuneiform experts to study the inscription in the detail they need.\nWe needed to scan Idrimi with greater precision. And so, earlier this month, Idrimi found himself being removed from his case by our heavy lifting team, and carefully placed in a roped-off area on the gallery floor, ready to be scanned.\nThis new project was a collaboration between the Museum and the Factum Foundation, a nonprofit organisation that uses digital technology to record cultural heritage throughout the world. A team from Factum spent two days scanning and photographing the statue in high resolution \u2013 we even stayed in the Museum until after midnight. Factum recorded the statue using two different methods:\nStructured light scanning: in this technique, the Factum team projected vertical beams of light onto the statue. They then measured how these beams were distorted, in order to map the statue in 3D.\nPhotogrammetry: in this technique, the Factum team took thousands of over-lapping high-resolution photographs from every possible angle. These were then uploaded into a computer program that matched the exact same pixels in different photos to develop the framework for a highly accurate 3D model.\nPhoto by Tracey Howe for Making Light.\nA replica of Idrimi\nThe Factum Foundation have now created a digital model of Idrimi that is accurate to less than a millimetre. This model provides a unique baseline for our ongoing conservation of the statue. It also enables researchers from all over the world to study the important life-story of king Idrimi in detail.\nBut one of the most exciting outcomes will be Factum Foundation\u2019s plan to create a highly accurate, life-sized replica. As the statue itself is too delicate to lend, Factum Foundation\u2019s replica will enable Idrimi to travel and they plan to lend it to an upcoming exhibition celebrating Syria\u2019s long history of cultural achievements called Syria: Past and Present, organised by the UK charity Making Light.\nRisking the curse, invoking the blessing\nWhen our team temporarily removed the statue from the safety of its case, I couldn\u2019t help but think we were risking Idrimi\u2019s curse. However, by scanning the statue we have made Idrimi\u2019s story available for everyone. As Idrimi says himself, by reading these words we can learn from his life, and ultimately bless this 3,500 year-old refugee from Aleppo forever."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/youve-been-framed/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "You've been framed", "author": "David Giles, Conservation Mounter of Western Art on Paper", "timestamp": "2017-04-06 00:00:00", "text": "I work as a Conservation Mounter at the British Museum where the prints and drawings we mount range from 15th-century works by Michelangelo to 21st-century contemporary works by Damien Hirst. These can be the size of postage stamps or a double bed! Highlighting this diversity of work are two recent exhibitions,\u00a0The American Dream: pop to the present, and Places of the mind: British watercolour landscapes 1850\u20131950.\nFrom left: Charlie Collinson, David Giles and Christina Angelo.\nThe American Dream has been a really great exhibition to work on. My background is in printmaking, so I can appreciate the complexities of modern printmaking and truly admire the innovative techniques experimented with from the 1960s onwards. \u00a0As well as the more conventional processes such as silkscreen, etching and lithography, the exhibition features lesser known techniques, such as the patented Mixografia technique (produced by placing wet handmade paper on inked printing plates and passed through a press under pressure resulting in a heavily embossed print) which have been fascinating to learn about.\nIn order to get work ready for an exhibition, each piece is examined to check that it is suitable for display by the curator and paper conservator, and undergoes conservation if necessary. The work is then handed over for mounting.\nDetail of Eric Avery\u2019s (b. 1948),\u00a0Blood Test. Moulded paper woodcut, 1988.\u00a0Image showing the highly textured surface.\nMany items for The American Dream were in good condition so only needed standard museum mounts\u00a0\u2013 our main consideration was how to mount some of the unconventional prints. Blood Test by the artist Eric Avery presented a challenge as it is a woodcut on very thick, pulpy paper like papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9.\nThe curator of the exhibition, Stephen Coppel, wanted the print to be displayed with a space between it and any backboard to give the impression that it was floating. This was achieved by attaching a sheet of paper honeycomb panel (php) to the back of the print.\nDetail of the structure of paper honeycomb panel and Japanese paper hinges being attached to back of print with methyl cellulose (adhesive).\nWe use php frequently in the mounting studio as it comes in large sheets and provides a lightweight rigid support. It is 15mm thick allowing a gap between the print and the backboard as requested by the curator. To attach this php to the print some Japanese paper hinges were attached to the back of the print with adhesive. Japanese paper is lightweight, long-fibred and relatively strong. When dry these hinges were wrapped round the edges of php and attached with adhesive.\nTop:\u00a0Paper hinges on the back of the print being attached to php. Bottom:\u00a0Paper honeycomb panel adhered to the print with hinges between weights, blotters and cushioning felts\nWhen hinges are adhered with an aqueous adhesive it is necessary to apply pressure to obtain a good bond while the hinges and mount board are drying. This was a bit tricky with the Eric Avery print as it was so textured and undulating. Several sheets of felt were used to mitigate pressure applied during drying to avoid squashing the print.\u00a0This whole package was then adhered to a sheet of Conservation board with adhesive ready to be framed for display. As with all the boards used in the studio, Conservation board is a high-quality mount board.\nSome of the works on display in The American Dream were gifted to the Museum and arrived attached to dealer\u2019s mounts/backboards often in their original frames. When we are unsure exactly of the quality of materials used we set about replicating the original mount with materials that are conservation quality and have been tested by our Scientific Research Department.\nEdward Ruscha (b. 1937), Cash for Tools 2/Rusty Signs.

Right: Print\u00a0being placed on backboard.\nUnlike with The American Dream the work in Places of the mind is on a much smaller scale adopting in-house standard sizes and styles that have been used at the Museum for over 150 years (although the styles have evolved, with the original mounting methods improved). For example, all drawings are now inlaid, which is a way of securing the drawing to a larger sheet of paper, which acts as a margin. This enables the drawing to be lifted if necessary in order to see the back, without having to handle the actual drawing itself. In the past drawings were attached to the backboards making the back of the drawing inaccessible.\nEntrance to the exhibition Places of the mind: British watercolour landscapes\u00a01850\u20131950.\nAn example of this is a drawing in the exhibition by George Robert Lewis which needed lifting from its old, shallow and slightly grubby original mount.\nGeorge Robert Lewis (1782\u20131871), Water-break, Ilfracombe. Watercolour and bodycolour over graphite, c. 1850. Print being lifted from its original mount.\nAfter this delicate operation was complete, the drawing was handed over to us by the conservators in order to make it safe enough to be displayed in Room 90, the Prints and Drawings Gallery. In addition, objects have to be well protected when lent to other institutions and as importantly, be able to sustain being handled on a regular basis by the general public in the Prints and Drawings study room.\nInlay paper with rectangle cut away to accommodate drawing.\nTo secure this drawing in its mount a \u2018strip\u2019 inlaying method was used which involves choosing an inlay paper that as far as possible complements the weight, colour and thickness of the drawing. The drawing is placed centrally on this sheet of inlay paper face up. A steady hand is then needed to cut around the perimeter of the drawing with a scalpel, firstly tracing around two of the edges, then moving the drawing one millimetre diagonally and cutting around the other two edges.\nBoth the drawing and inlay paper are then turned over and strips of thin Japanese paper are adhered with adhesive on all four sides to attach the two together.\nMount with detail of artist\u2019s name stamped and inlaid.\nWhen pressed and dry the inlay paper with adhered drawing is attached to an overthrow mount with tabs of archival cotton paper tape.\u00a0Finally, mounts are stamped with the artist and donor\u2019s names and the registration number which identifies a particular drawing among thousands of others in the collection.\nThe exhibition\u00a0The American Dream: pop to the present\u00a0runs at the Museum until\u00a018 June 2017.\nSponsored by Morgan Stanley.\nSupported by the Terra Foundation for American Art.\nBuy the book to explore\u00a0the unprecedented scale, boldness and ambition of American printmaking since the 1960s.\nYou can also browse\u00a0a range of products inspired by the works\u00a0in the exhibition, including a range of prints.\nPlaces of the mind: British watercolour landscapes 1850\u20131950\u00a0runs until 27 August 2017.\nSupported in memory of Melvin R Seiden\nDrawing on the the British Museum\u2019s impressive collection, the book\u00a0Places of the Mind: British watercolour landscapes 1850\u20131950\u00a0explores artists\u2019 spiritual quests to capture the essence of landscape and convey a sense of place."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/step-back-in-time/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Step back in time", "author": "Nicholas Ashton, Curator, Palaeolithic and Mesolithic Collections", "timestamp": "2017-04-04 00:00:00", "text": "The Happisburgh footprints are back. It\u2019s been three years since they\nhit the news\n, but they keep returning in different ways to remind us about the amazing story that they tell \u2013 this time in the free Asahi Shimbun Display\nMoving stories: three journeys\n, in Room 3 until 30 April 2017. Utilising advanced 3D modelling, the footprints are\u00a0displayed as a captivating projection within the space.\nThe footprints were discovered by pure chance in May 2013 on the foreshore beneath the cliffs of the Norfolk village. We were working with geophysics on the beach, recording the ancient river and estuary sediments that lie beneath the beach sand. Much of the sand had been washed away in recent storms, revealing large stretches of compacted silts and sands that had been estuary muds from the River Thames almost a million years ago.\nAt first I didn\u2019t see them, but my friend and colleague Martin Bates pointed out these unusual elongated shapes on a surface of the muds in an area about 4 or 5 metres long and up to 3 metres wide. He instantly recognised them as human footprints, but I was more sceptical.\nArchaeologists\u00a0inspecting the footprints soon after their discovery on the beach at Happisburgh.\nCould they be recent? The answer was no \u2013 the silts were hard and compacted and there was no way you could make an impression in them. Had they been eroded by the sea? Again, no \u2013 many of the hollows were definitely foot-shaped, with one end wider than the other and often a concave edge opposite a straight one. In one case you could even distinguish toes!\nWe had to act quickly before the sea eroded them away. Lifting them was impossible as the silts were heavy and we simply didn\u2019t have the time \u2013 it would have taken weeks. Fortunately a new technology was available \u2013 multi-image photogrammetry \u2013 where a series of digital photographs can be merged to form a 3D model. A few days later specialist photographer Sarah Duffy visited the site to start recording the footprints. Because of the tides, we couldn\u2019t get on to the beach until mid-afternoon, by which time the weather had deteriorated. But in wind-lashed rain we still managed to sponge out the water and sand from the hollows and from a rather precarious stepladder record the surface. A week later the footprints had been washed away by the sea.\nThe 3D model produced by Sarah Duffy and the Happisburgh Footprint Project.\nIt took a few days for Sarah to process the photographs but when she emailed through the 3D model I was finally convinced \u2013 the result was amazing, and this is what you can see projected\u00a0in the display\u00a0located in\u00a0Room 3. From the model\u00a0we could identify both adults and children, and we seemed to be dealing with a family group that were pausing at the edge of the estuary. So who were they?\nArtist\u2019s impression of the Norfolk coast with Homo antecessor by John Sibbick.\nAlthough we have no human bones from Britain, the most likely species was\nHomo antecessor\nor \u2018Pioneer Man\u2019\n, who lived in southern Europe at this time, around one million years ago. They were slightly smaller-brained than ourselves, but walked upright, with average males standing at about 1.73 metres (5ft 8in) tall.\nPrevious excavations from 2004.\nPrevious excavations\nat Happisburgh uncovered simple flint tools with an incredible array of plant and animal remains. Together, these help us to paint a picture of the environment in which these people lived. The grasslands of the river valley were grazed by herds of horse and deer, but there were also larger mammals like rhinos and mammoths. We do not know whether the people were hunters or scavengers, but they were certainly competing for game with hyenas and sabre-toothed cats. The valley was fringed by coniferous forest and we know that the climate was cooler than East Anglia today. As the oldest site excavated in northern Europe, this prompts questions about how humans survived the long, cold winters. Did they have clothing, shelter or fire? At the moment we simply don\u2019t know.\nThe finished result: the 3D projection in Room 3.\nThe footprints are just one of the three stories in\nthe Asahi Shimbun Display located in Room 3\nthat tell of human migration. We wanted to somehow enliven the still image of the footprint surface to reflect this, so came up with the idea of slowly ebbing water, and as it flows away highlighting first the adults and then the children\u2019s footprints. This gives an amazing effect, and it\u2019s accompanied with the gentle sounds of water, estuary birds and children\u2019s chatter.\nHappisburgh tells of a metaphoric journey where people have crossed the natural boundaries of their known world. It is a story of survival in a harsh environment, but also one of opportunity. It is this journey and similar endeavours that eventually led to improved hunting and the use of clothing, shelter and fire \u2013 the provision of basic human needs that are still important to us today.\nThe Asahi Shimbun Display\nMoving stories: three journeys\nis free and in Room 3 until 30 April 2017.\nSupported by The Asahi Shimbun."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/fake-news/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "FAKE NEWS", "author": "British Museum", "timestamp": "2017-04-01 00:00:00", "text": "It\u2019s 1 April \u2013 and that means April Fools\u2019 Day. The day\u2019s origins are shrouded in mystery, with many possible explanations offered (which you can handily read on Wikipedia or Snopes if you like).\nIn the spirit of the day, we\u2019ve selected five fakes, forgeries and things designed to fool that you can find in the Museum\u2019s collection. Although they may not be what they claim to be, these objects are still of great value and interest. We\u2019ve even included a bonus sneak preview of a forthcoming exhibition all about fakes.\nAntiques faux show\nThe Piranesi Vase: about 7%\u00a0Roman. Not really a vase either\u2026\nItalian architect and engraver Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720\u20131778) is best known for his architectural views of ancient and modern Rome aimed at the Grand Tour market. By the late 1760s he began to engage in the lucrative restoration and sale of antiquities. In 1769 he acquired a great number of ancient fragments found on the grounds of the villa of the Roman emperor Hadrian (r. AD 117\u2013138) at Tivoli near Rome. He restored these fragments and incorporated them into highly decorative pastiches. He even published a book describing them.\nPiranesi\u2019s description of this vase in his book praises it as a fine work dating to\u00a0the time of the emperor Hadrian \u2013 the second century AD. However, he does not mention that only small sections of it are ancient (two of the bull\u2019s heads on the base, sections of the lion\u2019s legs and parts of the relief depicting satyrs picking grapes). The rest of it is entirely of Piranesi\u2019s own making. So the vase is really a grand neoclassical work rather than an antiquity, as Piranesi claimed. You can see it today in Room 1, the Enlightenment Gallery.\nSpecial Offa\nOffa imitation dinar: not quite the shilling (or the dinar).\nThis unique gold coin of Offa, king of Mercia, is one of the most remarkable English coins of the Middle Ages. It imitates a gold dinar of the caliph al-Mansur, ruler of the Islamic Abbasid dynasty. Although the Arabic inscription is not copied perfectly, it is close enough that it is clear that the original from which it was copied was struck in the Islamic year AH 157 (AD 773\u2013774). It seems that the engraver had no understanding of the Arabic script \u2013 the name and title OFFA REX (King Offa) has been inserted upside down in relation to the Arabic inscription.\nWhy the coin was made is not known for certain. It has been suggested that it was made as a gift for the pope (it was first recorded in Rome), but it is unlikely that any Christian king would have sent the pope a coin with an inscription stating that \u2018there is no God but Allah alone\u2019, however badly the Arabic had been copied. It is more likely that it was designed for use in trade \u2013\u00a0Islamic gold dinars were the most important coinage in the Mediterranean at the time. Offa\u2019s coin looked enough like the original that it would be readily accepted in southern Europe, while at the same time his own name was clearly visible.\nA bit fishy\n\u2018Merman\u2019: not actually a merman, more a \u2018monkey-fish\u2019\u2026\nDid you know there was a merman on display in the Enlightenment Gallery (Room 1)? OK, not really a merman \u2013 it\u2019s actually part monkey, part fish! It was donated by HRH Prince Arthur of Connaught (1883\u20131938), grandson of Queen Victoria, and was said to have been \u2018caught\u2019 in Japan during the 18th century. It was given to Prince Arthur by an individual named Arisue Seijiro.\n\u2018Mermen\u2019, though more often \u2018mermaids\u2019, are well known in ancient, medieval and modern mythology across a number of different cultures. They are represented in art and sculpture, and examples like this one were also presented as curiosities in private houses and popular sideshows in Europe from at least the 17th century. A large number of these seem to have come from East Asia, especially Japan.\nThe Museum\u2019s \u2018merman\u2019 is displayed in the Enlightenment Gallery as an example of the kind of \u2018curiosity\u2019 that was found in early collections before the more encyclopaedic and reasoned approach to collecting that evolved through the 1700s. In this context it helps to show how museums changed during the 18th century from cabinets of curiosity to the type of museums we are more familiar with today.\nFamily jewels\nHippocamp pendant: not a Renaissance jewel (but still rather lovely).\nThis pendant was acquired by the Rothschild family from the Conyngham collection and appears to have been in the Debruge Dumenil collection in Paris before 1847, which would make it an early documented fake. It is made of enamelled gold, emeralds and pearls, and is in the form of a hippocamp with a Native American rider.\u00a0The hippocamp (also hippocampus \u2013 from the Greek \u1f35\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 (horse) and \u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 (monster)) is a mythological creature sometimes known in English as a sea-horse. It is usually depicted with a horse\u2019s front and fish-like hindquarters.\nThe pendant looks similar to jewels made in the 16th century that were intended to show off massive deep-green emeralds from the Colombian mines in the New World. This example was probably made in Paris in the early 19th century though, as an imitation of this Renaissance splendour. It is set with 13 impressive cabochon and table-cut emeralds. The separately cast Native American rider (riding side-saddle) was perhaps thought appropriate for a jewel set with Colombian emeralds. It\u2019s on display in Room 2a, the Waddesdon Bequest, which houses a surprising number of fakes alongside original medieval and Renaissance treasures, all collected by the Rothschild family in the 19th century.\nFunny money\nForged Swedish note: Monopoly money is better than this.\nThis counterfeit banknote was made in Gothenburg, Sweden, in the 1860s. It was hand drawn and the forger has attempted to replicate a printed Swedish 10 riksdaler note. It must have taken a long time to produce. The appearance and feel of money can be central to an individual\u2019s willingness to accept it. Would you be convinced by this fake? (You can see what a real one looked like here\u2026)\nAlthough it may seem relatively harmless today, forgery was generally considered to be a very serious crime, often with extremely harsh punishments. In medieval times, convicted counterfeiters in Germany were boiled alive in oil, and in Russia they had molten lead poured down their throat. In the 17th century, women involved with forgery could be burnt at the stake and even in the 19th century forgers could be hanged. Although the death penalty is no longer used in the UK, forgery and counterfeiting are still punishable by a prison sentence \u2013 so don\u2019t try this at home!\nWhat do you think? What\u2019s your favourite fake in the collection? Are there any fabulous forgeries you love seeing?

The deliberate targeting of the king, as the constitutional monarch and head of the Church of England, could be likened to iconoclasm, a direct assault on the male authority figures that were perceived to be upholding the laws of the country. As Neil MacGregor wrote in\u00a0A History of the World in 100 Objects, \u2018this coin stands for all those who fought for the right to vote\u2019.\nThe British Museum\u2019s example was minted in 1903 but most likely circulated unaltered for ten years before it was defaced, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War in around 1913\u20131914. We know this from the date of other coins bearing the same slogan in identical lettering. It was said at the time, that the suffragettes had copied the practice from anarchists, who were defacing similar coins with the phrase \u2018Vive l\u2019Anarchie\u2019. Precisely just how many coins were defaced is unknown: several other examples are known to exist besides the Museum\u2019s \u2018Votes for Women\u2019 coin, but the effort required to deface a single coin means it is unlikely that many were made. It was probably carried out by a single person using just one set of individual alphabet stamps, a process that would have been repetitive and time-consuming. The perpetrator has never been traced, and no direct connection has ever been established between the coins and the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union (WSPU) or other suffragette organisations.\nThe First World War is commonly perceived as a watershed moment, when the sun finally set on the Victorian golden age: \u2018never such innocence, never before or since\u2019, to use the oft-quoted words of Larkin. Yet this is a romanticised and superficial view of pre-war Britain that conceals a more disturbing image, of a country beset by domestic crises and civil disorder. These included anarchist violence and the beginnings of the Troubles in Ireland, and chief among them was the campaign for women\u2019s suffrage.\u00a0Suffragette militarism, or \u2018direct action\u2019, as it was also known, was characterised by bombings, arson, window smashing and the destruction of cultural property. It reached a tragic climax when Emily Wilding Davison ran out in front of the king\u2019s horse at the Epsom Derby, in June 1914. The simple act of defacing a coin can appear trivial in comparison with these more serious acts of sedition, but it nevertheless conveyed the same symbolic message of protest against a government that refused to extend women the vote.\nThe coin is displayed in the Citi Money Gallery\u00a0(Room 68).\nHockenhull, Thomas. \u2018Stamped all over the King\u2019s Head: Defaced Coins and Women\u2019s Suffrage\u2019, British Numismatic Journal, 86 (2016), pp.238-245."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-british-museum-membercast-footprints-in-time/", "category": "Podcasts", "title": "The British Museum Membercast: Footprints in time", "author": "British Museum and Andrew Shore", "timestamp": "2017-03-28 00:00:00", "text": "Featuring snippets from Nick\u2019s sell-out Members\u2019 lecture in January, the fourth episode of\u00a0Membercast\u00a0examines the British Museum\u2019s 15-year-old research project that began after the discovery of a family of footprints\u00a0in Happisburgh, Norfolk.\nThe British Museum Membercast is a monthly podcast made available to \u2018all studious and curious persons\u2019.

When writing was first invented, did the ancients write the stories of their peoples or great literature? No \u2013\u00a0it was used primarily for bureaucracy!

Rather pleasingly, the text records beer given to workers as part of their daily rations.\nMint condition\nElectrum coin. Lydia, 7th century BC.\nGetting paid in beer might seem like a good idea, but isn\u2019t always practical. To help with transactions, some Mediterranean kingdoms started issuing pieces of metal that were the same weight. The example above is one of the earliest coins in the world, minted in the Kingdom of Lydia (in modern day Turkey) over 2,500 years ago. Made of electrum, a naturally occurring amalgam of gold and silver, these irregular shaped coins were issued to a strict weight standard, and stamped with symbols which acted as a guarantee of weight and purity.\nBronze money in the form of a spade. China, 5th century BC.\nAt a similar time, coins began to appear in China for the first time. These coins take the shape of agricultural implements, in this example a spade. They bear inscriptions that refer to a geographical area, group or weight.\nHeads and tales\nSilver coin featuring head of Brutus and Pileus between two daggers. Roman Republic, 43\u201342 BC\nBefore the invention of printing, the coin was the great tool of mass communication. Following the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, his betrayer Brutus issued his own coins to speak directly to the people of Rome. These coins featured his portrait on one side, with two daggers accompanied by a Pileus hat (a piece of headgear associated with liberation) on the other. Below the iconography ran the now infamous words EID MAR: The Ides of March. The coin celebrates the assassination of Julius Caesar and what the conspirators saw as the liberation of the Roman people from tyranny.\nGold aureus coin of the Roman emperor Claudius. Rome, AD 46\u201347.\nThis coin celebrates the Roman emperor Claudius\u2019 triumph over Britain. The back of the coin shows Claudius on a horse, on top of a triumphal arch. Romans built these in honour of a victorious general. The letters on the arch read DE BRITANN \u2013 the Latin for \u2018[a triumph] over the Britons\u2019.\nWorth the paper it\u2019s written on?\nA note known as the Great Ming Circulating Treasure, China, 1375, with the detail of the string of coins, showing what the note was worth.\nCoins are all very well, but the invention of paper money in China over 1,000 years ago is one of the true revolutionary inventions of human history. This note is worth 1,000 wen coins (coins that were confusingly called \u2018cash\u2019 by Europeans). They are shown on the note by a picture of a string of 1,000 bronze coins (in 10 stacks of 100 coins each). 1,000 coins would have been 1.5 metres long and would have weighed about 3kg(!), so having a paper note was much more convenient. However, the note also contains a strong warning to any would-be counterfeiters that their crime would be punishable by execution!\n50 pfennig Notgeld. Issued in M\u00fcritz, Germany, 1922.\nOne of the problems with physical money through the ages has been that sometimes there\u2019s too much of it, and sometimes not enough. During the First World War a shortage of coins encouraged towns and regions in several European countries to issue local notes worth small sums. In Germany this Notgeld (\u2018emergency money\u2019) became popular with collectors who prized the notes for the great variety of designs, and by the 1920s these tiny notes were produced in vast numbers with collecting, rather than spending, in mind. Designs on the notes ranged from wartime propaganda to local views or scenes from folklore. This particular example depicts the German seaside resort of Muritz on the Baltic sea.\n100,000,000,000,000,000,000 Hungarian peng\u0151 banknote. Hungary, 1946.\nThis Hungarian 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 peng\u0151 note is the largest denomination ever issued on a banknote. It was printed in January 1946 during a period of hyperinflation which saw denominations doubling every 15 hours. Count the zeroes!\nHeavy metal and rolling stones\nCopper plate money. Sweden, 1658.\nPaper money and coins are convenient as they are portable, but this isn\u2019t always the case with money. Weighing in at 14kg and over 65cm long, this Swedish plate money from the 17th century is actually a coin! The country\u2019s vast copper resources swelled the royal coffers and, fearful of a dip in international copper prices, Sweden aimed to absorb much of its own output in the creation of a copper currency, but its abundance meant it wasn\u2019t very valuable except in large quantities (this example was worth about 2\u00a0kegs (tunna) of rye). This practice led one Danish visitor to comment, \u2018Many people carry their money in a rope on their backs, others place them on their head and, in cases of large sums, they transport them on a wagon.\u2019 This isn\u2019t exactly tap and go\u2026\nStone money. Yap, Micronesia, c. 1900\u20131940.\nContinuing our theme of big money this stone ring (rai) from the Pacific island of Yap is nearly half a metre in diameter which sounds big, but is small compared to some examples which could be up to 3 metres wide! The famous British economist John Maynard Keynes was fascinated with the money, which when in place was rarely moved but could still be spent. He described the Yap islanders as \u2018a people whose ideas on currency are probably more truly philosophical than those of any country.\u2019\nBuried treasure\nCorbridge hoard and jug.\nBefore modern banks, what could you do with your money to keep it safe? For millennia people hid money or buried it in the ground. This generally worked as gold in particular kept its value, whether or not the currency itself did. When it was found in 1911, this jug was uncovered with two bronze coins in its neck, strategically placed to hide the true value of its contents, 160 Roman gold coins!\nBuddhist reliquary vase. Wardak, Afghanistan, AD 178.\nAlthough hoards were often\u00a0buried with the intention of retrieving them at a later date, sometimes people buried coins for other reasons. While money\u2019s primary function is economic, over the centuries it has become entwined with ideas of spirituality and devotion. This vase from Afghanistan contained bronze coins and was buried as an offering to the Buddha for the benefit of a man called Vagramarega and his family.\nPlastic fantastic!\nBank of Americard credit card. USA, 1966.\nAround 50 years ago, another major change in the history of money took place. The first credit cards that we would recognise today were issued by Bank of America in 1958. To promote this new way to pay, the bank mailed a plastic card unsolicited to every customer in the Californian city of Fresno, California. The period between 1966 and 1970 became known as the great credit card race when 100 million cards were mailed to potential users. In Chicago in 1967 some people claimed to have received up to 15 separate cards!\nMondex card cash transfer terminal and portable card reader. Britain, 1995.\nThe first experiments with electronic cash payments took place in the 1990s. Mondex electronic cash system was trialled in the British town of Swindon in 1995 and was promoted as an alternative to coins and banknotes. Perhaps Mondex was ahead of its time as the trials ended without a nationwide launch of the service, but the rise of cashless payments in the UK means that over half of consumer payments today are done without using coins or banknotes. People sometimes comment on \u2018the cashless society\u2019 but we\u2019re not there quite yet. Whatever happens, the Museum will continue to collect and display objects that tell this constantly evolving and often fascinating story.\nTrace the history of money from prehistory to the present day\u00a0in the British Museum\u2019s\u00a0Citi Money Gallery.\nSupported by Citi."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/in-search-of-a-lost-city-and-a-lost-explorer/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "In search of a lost city... and a lost explorer", "author": "Jago Cooper, Curator of the Americas, Department of Africa, Oceania and the Americas and Kate Jarvis, Project Curator, Africa, Oceania and the Americas", "timestamp": "2017-03-24 00:00:00", "text": "New film The Lost City of Z is pure Hollywood \u2013 a classic epic of beautiful cinematography, captivating storylines and handsome protagonists. It tells the story of Colonel Percy Fawcett who, along with his 22-year-old son Jack, set off into the dense rainforest of the Amazon in spring 1925 and (***spoiler alert!***) was never to be seen or heard from again. In 1954 his younger son Brian compiled the journal notes that Fawcett had made on previous expeditions into a compelling book entitled Exploration Fawcett. More recently, New Yorker journalist David Grann became captivated by Fawcett and the mystery surrounding his disappearance. Grann\u2019s own exploration and research culminated in his book The Lost City of Z, from which the film is adapted.\nRed carpet at the premiere for The Lost City of Z at the British Museum, February 2017.\nGrann is not the first to have succumbed to Fawcett fever. In the years following his disappearance, as many as a hundred would-be heroes ventured into the jungle to look for him. Among them was Peter Fleming, brother of Ian, who with his friend Roger Pettiward tried and failed to reach the location of Fawcett\u2019s disappearance in 1932. Upon their return Peter Fleming wrote Brazilian Adventure (1933) an irreverent and highly amusing account of their quest, while Roger Pettiward donated the small collection of objects collected on their travels from the Karaj\u00e1 and Tapirap\u00e9 indigenous communities to the British Museum.\nRattle made of tortoise shell, feathers, wood and string. Karaj\u00e1. Collected and donated by Roger Pettiward in 1932.\nTo this day, elusive tales and mythologies about Fawcett\u2019s demise abound on the internet. Some even claim that he is still alive (despite the fact that he would be 150 years old this year!) or that he never intended to return, but had set up an occultist commune in the Amazon.\nThe British Museum holds a small collection of objects that Fawcett acquired throughout his expeditions to South America between 1906 and 1925, which has been largely overlooked, despite the world\u2019s obsession with all things Fawcett. In many ways, these objects reveal as much about Fawcett\u2019s journey as his writings. These artefacts were witness to Fawcett\u2019s personal development as he turned from a man completely ignorant of South America, its landscape and its peoples to a man obsessed with the Amazon, its inhabitants and the treasures it might yet give up.\nNecklace of mammal teeth and beads. Formerly on loan to the Royal Geographical Society, donated by Nina Fawcett to the British Museum in 1931.\nFawcett and his party set off in canoes upriver from the mouth of the River Heath in summer 1910. On the seventh day they \u2019rounded a bend in the river where on a sandbank stood a large Indian encampment\u2019 (Exploration Fawcett p. 144). Under arrow and gunfire Fawcett and his team loudly played the accordion and sang until the arrows stopped, in a scene dramatically depicted in the film. Perhaps Fawcett and his team were hoping to distract with laughter the potentially hostile intentions of those whose territory these uninvited intruders had strayed onto. Hostilities over, they scrambled ashore \u2018into the midst of a group of forty or fifty Guarayo braves. [\u2026] Some of them had shot-guns stolen from the rubber pickers, but most were armed only with the great black bows, six feet or more in length, and arrows equally long. A few had arms and faces painted in square patterns with the juice of the Urucu berry, and wore shirts of\u00a0 beaten bark with a design across the chest in purple dye. Some wore long dark gowns which give them a feminine appearance; others were completely naked\u2018. (p. 147)\n\u2018Six Indians passed the night on the sandbar with us, the only ones of the tribe to be found next morning. The others had apparently gone off into the forest, for all the canoes remained, and the Cacique had left as a present for us a number of tooth necklaces.\u2018 (p. 148). The necklace pictured above is one of the tooth necklaces given to Fawcett that day by the chief of Guarayo, today known as the Ese Ejja.\nThe British Museum\u2019s Fawcett collection also includes this tooth necklace and pearl-shell shell ear ornament, but we are unsure of the specific details surrounding their collection. It could be that they too were among the chief\u2019s gifts.\nLeft: Necklace made of mammal teeth and string. Formerly on loan to the Royal Geographical Society, donated by Nina Fawcett to the British Museum in 1931. Right: Ear ornament made of pearl-shell, beads and seeds. Formerly on loan to the Royal Geographical Society, donated by Nina Fawcett to the British Museum in 1931.\nIn 1914, Fawcett set off up the River Guapor\u00e9 until he reached the Mequens River. From there he headed up to the Parecis Plains, which he found to be so beautiful that \u2018I could well understand why, scattered through the forests, there are hermits of many nationalities, preferring a life alone in the wild to a penurious and uncertain existence in civilisation. Rather than pity them for losing the amenities we are accustomed to consider so necessary, we should envy them for having the wisdom of knowing how superfluous such things really are. Perhaps they are the ones most likely to find the true meaning of life.\u2019 (p. 197).\nPushing on into the forest, there were fewer and fewer signs that the area had been exploited for rubber. Several weeks of walking brought them into contact with an indigenous village, whose inhabitants Fawcett called the Maxubi. Upon arriving at the village, Fawcett describes peering from the woods to ensure that there was no danger and in doing so, observing a child \u2018a nut in one hand and a little stone axe in the other. He squatted down on his haunches before a flat stone, laid the nut on it, and then started to hammer on the shell with the side of the axe\u2019.\nAxe with a black stone blade hafted to wooden handle bent around the top of the stone and secured with beeswax and string. Formerly on loan to the Royal Geographical Society, donated by Nina Fawcett to the British Museum in 1931.\nAt the end of their stay with the Maxubi \u2018Loaded with string bags of peanuts, stone axes, and bows and arrows \u2013 the weapons were real works of art \u2013 we left the Maxubis and turned south-west towards Bolivia.\u2019 (p. 204). There is no doubt that this axe was one of these. Perhaps it was even the one shown in this photograph taken by Fawcett:\nMaxubi priest with an axe.\u00a0Photograph by Percy Fawcett, in Exploration Fawcett.\nFawcett spent enough time with the Maxubi to gain some understanding of the language and to produce a vocabulary list of around a\u00a0hundred words. Fawcett\u2019s account is the only known mention of the Maxubi, but based on this vocabulary, it is now believed that the Maxubi were the indigenous community known today as the Arikap\u00fa.\nWhat these objects help to tell is a story of a man confronted by such cultural contrasts and environmental shocks that he was forced to challenge his own sense of purpose and goal in life. This is a reflection of the time, when the post-Victorian age of the gentlemen explorer was coming to an end and the domain of science and scientific lines of enquiry with discipline specific research expeditions became the norm. The last of a generation of amateurs, in many ways he struggled with the questions he was forced to confront, questions that now generations of botanists, anthropologists, archaeologists continue to research and advance.\nIn turn, the indigenous communities\u00a0Fawcett met exemplify the cultural resilience of the Amazon. Recent research has proven that this is a human landscape in which indigenous populations have lived for millennia, enduring huge social and environmental upheaval and continuing to struggle against injustice and exploitation. This is a narrative which this surprisingly enlightened film does try to portray. It may be a Hollywood blockbuster, but hopefully this film will attract a new audience who want to learn more about the wonders of the Amazon and its indigenous peoples, and, to quote Fawcett himself, find \u2018the true meaning of life\u2019.\nThe Lost City of Z, which premiered at the British Museum in February 2017, is in cinemas now.

This narrative, about an official\u2019s troubled life-story was written in about 1850 BC and survives in many manuscripts, including one in a collection of texts that was buried in a tomb at Luxor in around 1680 BC, and is now known as the Ramesseum papyri. My work is part of an ongoing joint British Museum and Oxford University project on the Ramesseum papyri, during which we have published new photos of the main papyri in an online catalogue,\u00a0and in a DVD with the Egyptian Museum, Berlin. I\u2019m also re-examining the copy of the poem in the Ashmolean museum,\u00a0helped by research assistant Ann Gill, and (perhaps most importantly) every year I read the poem with students, because it is an undergraduate set text in the Oxford Egyptology course.\nHowever, while academic commentaries can deal easily with the technical details of reading the manuscripts, of the verb-forms and the lexicography, the poem is also a hugely emotional work of art. In order to try to capture a sense of what the poem might have felt like to its original audiences \u2013 a sense of what E M Forster termed \u2018the union of shadow and adamant that men call poetry\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019ve worked with actors over the past decade, including Gary Pillai and Shobu Kapoor. Most often, I\u2019ve worked with a very good friend, Barbara Ewing, who is a historical novelist as well as an actress, and so understands as well as any Egyptologist the difficulties we face when dealing with old texts. We\u2019ve worked together on several Middle Kingdom poems, and she accompanied my inaugural lecture at Oxford which was about a single couplet of Sinuhe. Now she\u2019s recorded a full reading of Sinuhe.\nThe problem with any poetry is that it is untranslatable, and Sinuhe\u00a0is now very remote; Barbara said that she found it the most challenging piece she has ever had to deal with. How do you capture the ancient resonances of phrases that mean nothing to modern audiences? How do you invest them with meaning and emotion without a set of explanatory footnotes that kill all spontaneity? For me the point was to let Barbara bring her skills to illuminate the poem, and to teach me what it could be like in performance. We\u2019ve discussed it over several years, and when we started rehearsing Barbara dug deeper and deeper into the text. We only squabbled once over how a line might be delivered (we\u2019re both quite stubborn, neither of us gave way, and I\u2019m delighted with the solution we reached). The translation we used was based on the one published in an Oxford World Classics anthology, but she suggested several small changes to help a modern listener, usually clarifying a pronoun or reversing the order of two verses. I also made several minor alterations to help clarify the sense for listeners unfamiliar with the ancient background, such as saying \u2018War-god\u2019 instead of the god\u2019s name \u2018Montu\u2019. I kept asking friends at my college if certain phrases sounded natural to them, so that none of it would sound written in Egyptological-ese. When Sinuhe returns home and is re-integrated into Egyptian society, his hair receives some sort of treatment, either styling or cutting, and so I ended up asking \u2018what do you usually ask for at the barbers? What word do you use?\u2019\nBarbara Ewing and Professor Richard Bruce Parkinson.\nSinuhe is quite a long narrative poem \u2013 almost 600 lines of verse \u2013 and I think it was hard to convey sense of changing pace and structure, among the many other obstacles. Barbara was determined that it should not sound falsely grandiose (like the dreadful Hollywood film of the poem), and to keep it very internal and understated, even as the hero undergoes a series of emotional crises and breakdowns. The poem has a lot of exciting action in it, but it also moves by subtext: characters talk to each other but mean much more than they actually say, and it deals with \u2018unrepeatedly great matters\u2019, raising questions of motivation that are left unresolved. There had to be a sense of things happening beneath the surface.\nWe spent three days rehearsing in London, and then Barbara came for a full day\u2019s recording at an underground studio at Oxford University Media Services. At the end of the day we went and looked at the copy of the poem in the Ashmolean Museum together. The unedited recording, made by Karen Casey, lasted an hour and 46 minutes and included repeats, various retakes and variations. The final cut is 41 minutes long and is available on Oxford University\u2019s podcast website and iTunes.\n\n\nThe Life of Sinuhe read by Barbara Ewing. Translated by Richard Bruce Parkinson. This recording is part of The Tale of Sinuhe: A Reader\u2019s Commentary (for the British Museum and Oxford University Ramesseum Papyri Project).\nMy favourite line of all is perhaps when Sinuhe\u2019s patron, Queen Nefru, screams in shock as she recognises her old servant. We debated whether Barbara should add an actual scream (as she did in the inaugural lecture about this couplet) or instead keep strictly to the words of the original, and try to convey the shock with only the words of the poem? We did several takes, but when I listened to the unedited recording there was no doubt for me: Barbara\u2019s words alone conveyed the scream without it needing to be acted out.\nIt is one thing to write about performance from a theoretical perspective, but it\u2019s another to work with an actor. I learnt so much about the poem from our sessions together, and my only regret is that a month later while I was re-examining photographs of one of the papyri, I spotted a new solution to a long-standing grammatical difficulty, meaning that one verse of the reading should really have a slightly different tense. But no translation or performance is ever going to be definitive. \u00a0What matters to me, beyond these philological details, is that Barbara has found a voice for the heart of this ancient poem.\nWant to hear more?

The Amazon queen Penthesilea\nBlack-figured amphora (wine-jar) signed by Exekias as potter and attributed to him as painter. Made in Attica, Greece, 530\u2013525 BC. Found in Vulci, Italy.\nThe Amazons were a wild race of warrior women, and women only, who were believed by the Greeks to live somewhere on the northern borders of the Greek world.\u00a0 They were entirely mythical, of course \u2013 but they were still capable of striking fear into the hearts of Greek men, always representing a potentially deadly threat to male civilisation. Greek storytelling was full of accounts of conflicts between Greeks and Amazons, and how this dangerously female power base was eventually stamped on: the women were either defeated in battle, or \u2018mastered\u2019 in the bedroom when they finally saw the error of their segregated ways and opted for marriage with Greek men. Both versions are hinted at in this 6th-century BC pot, made in Athens. It shows the mythical hero Achilles killing the Amazon queen, Penthesilea. It was said that, at the very moment that she died, the pair fell in love. Too late.\n2. A Vestal Virgin\nMarble head of a Vestal Virgin. Roman, 2nd century AD.\nVery few women had a powerful, public role anywhere in the ancient world. But this 2nd-century AD head shows one of those who did. She is one of the priestesses known as the Vestal Virgins, who had the important job of guarding the sacred hearth of the city in their temple in the Roman Forum. In return they were granted a range of privileges: from front row seats at the theatre to the right to free convicted criminals and special private transport arrangements around the city. But these privileges were hard earned. In addition to the obligation to remain virgins, they had to make sure that the fire on the sacred hearth never went out. If it did, it was a sure indication that the state was in danger and that one of the Vestals was no longer a virgin. And the penalty for that was burial alive.\n3. The goddess Athena\nBlack-figured Panathenaic amphora showing the goddess Athena. Made in Attica, Greece, 565\u2013560 BC.\nAthena was the Greek goddess of wisdom and of everything that demanded human cleverness, from spinning and weaving to navigation; and she was the goddess who gave special protection to the city of Athens (the famous Parthenon temple on the Acropolis was dedicated to Athena). But it is hard to know quite how female she would have seemed to the average Athenian. As you can see on this 6th-century BC Athenian pot, she was a warrior (when, apart from the weird Amazons, fighting was man\u2019s work in the classical Greek world). She was a virgin (when women were supposed to produce babies for the state) and she herself was not even born from a woman, but direct from head of her father, the god Zeus. She certainly did not provide a positive female role-model, in the Greek sense of the word \u2018female\u2019.\n4. Egyptian queen Cleopatra\nSilver tetradrachm coin of Mark Antony and Cleopatra. Minted in Syria, c. 36 BC.\nCleopatra (VII) is one of the most famous women in the history of the world: queen of Egypt, lover of Julius Caesar (and mother of his child), and of Mark Antony (a relationship immortalised by William Shakespeare, not to mention Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton). Outside the heartlands of ancient Greece and Rome, there are queens and princesses with rather more power to their names. On this 1st-century BC coin, in the words around her portrait head, Cleopatra is described as \u2018queen\u2019 and \u2018goddess\u2019. But how much independent power she had is difficult to pin down. She is almost represented as the partner of some prominent Roman man. Was this equality? Was she their pawn? Or were they hers?\n5. An anonymous Roman woman\nMarble relief from a tomb with a portrait of a woman as victorious Venus. Roman, c. AD 100\u2013120.\nIt is important not to forget those ancient women who were not rich and famous, not mythical heroines or superhuman goddesses. This Roman woman lived sometime in the early 2nd century AD. We do not even know her name let alone what she did with her life (the panel at the bottom where her history was meant to have been inscribed was left blank). But she was important enough to someone to be shown on her tomb in the guise of Venus, the goddess of love: she is semi-naked and holds a dove and a palm as Venus was often shown. For some grieving husband or parents, she was a goddess.\nDo you agree? Who would be in your top five? Let us know on Twitter, where you can also follow Mary.

Recent acquisitions span the globe, from a Grayson Perry vase to original Japanese manga drawings, and from Indigenous Australian paintings to Jasper Johns\u2019 Flags I\u00a0(featured on the exhibition poster). Future generations will be able to reflect on these dynamic and turbulent times through these objects.\nJasper Johns\u2019\u00a0Flags I in the exhibition. Gift of Johanna and Leslie Garfield, on loan from the American Friends of the British Museum. Photo: Adam Lucy.\nThis exhibition\u00a0traces the creative momentum of American art from the early 1960s through the medium of printing, charting\u00a0the rise of movements like minimalism, conceptual art and photorealism, to the practices of living artists working today. More than 200 works by 70 artists are on display, highlighting the creativity of American printmaking that flourished over six decades. Thanks to a deliberate strategy of collecting these artists by our curators, 70% of the works in the show are in the British Museum\u2019s collection. The biggest names in American art are represented: Roy Lichtenstein,\u00a0Robert Rauschenberg,\u00a0Chuck Close, Louise Bourgeois,\u00a0Andy Warhol, all of whom innovated\u00a0with printmaking to create some of their most memorable\u00a0work.\nIt all starts with pop art, of course. Pop art sits in the public consciousness as representing all that was new and cool in the 60s, but it is not necessarily to everyone\u2019s taste:\n\u2018Surely pop art represents the triumph of superficiality, the death of profundity and careful looking\u2026 What, then, is the British Museum, that bastion of careful, scholarly scrutiny, doing warmly embracing and collecting such rubbish?\u2019 Michael Glover, The Independent\nWith pop art, a revolutionary and enduring change in the production, marketing and consumption of art\u00a0took place. Inspired by the monumental, bold and colourful\u00a0imagery of post-war America (particularly the powerful medium of advertising), a young generation of artists\u00a0created images that defined this period in the popular imagination. Pop art is integral to the story of printmaking, and to the story of America, so the exhibition couldn\u2019t have begun with anything else.\nAndy Warhol\u2019s 10 Marilyn Monroes in the\u00a0exhibition.\nThis exhibition has been several years in the making. Nobody could have anticipated the transformative world events that now inevitably\u00a0shape our visitors\u2019 perceptions of the meaning of \u2018the American Dream\u2019.\n\u2018Looking at the art of Jasper Johns, including a print that gives a coat hanger the sublime authority of a Rembrandt portrait, not to mention at Robert Motherwell\u2019s lithographs of abstract expressionist splash-marks or powerfully chaotic prints by Willem de Kooning, I understood two things very clearly. There is such a thing as American civilisation. And we are watching it die.\u2019 Jonathan Jones, The Guardian\nThe confidence and assertiveness of America in the post-war boom years seems now to have\u00a0disintegrated, and\u00a0the very notion of the country\u2019s exceptionalism has been critically questioned by artists.\u00a0America has always been reinventing itself, and now is the perfect time to seek to understand what \u2018the American Dream\u2019 means today.\nA glimpse inside the exhibition.\n\u2018With a\u00a0new administration establishing itself in\u00a0Washington, it feels like an apposite moment to\u00a0consider how artists have reflected America as a\u00a0nation over 60 tumultuous years.\u2019\u00a0Hartwig Fischer, Director of the British Museum\nThe creative momentum unleashed in the 1960s persists to this day. There is also much to celebrate about the present. As you move through the exhibition, the voices represented become increasingly diverse, showcasing the work of women and people of colour, reflecting the changing art world and the advances in social equality over this period.\nKara Walker prints in the exhibition. Photo: Kate Marsden.\nEvery artist in the exhibition \u2013 whether they were born in America or made it their home \u2013 has their own American Dream, which demands our attention and makes us re-examine our own ideas about this superpower.\n\u2018There is still cause for excitement: the final prints in the exhibition are a set of etchings by the Ethiopian-born American artist Julie Mehretu, in which swirls of complex marks suggest a sense of inchoate energy and, perhaps, optimism, amid challenging, changing times.\u2019\u00a0Alastair Sooke, The Telegraph\nAmerican artists continue to explore the vital and expressive potential of printmaking as an integral part of their aesthetic, with its ability to reach a broad and diverse audience, and address wider social and political issues.\nKeith Haring\u2019s Ignorance is Fear in the exhibition.

Yet so often in history\u00a0half the world has been ignored or obscured. On the occasion of International Women\u2019s Day \u2013 and as part of Women\u2019s History Month \u2013 we\u2019ve compiled contributions from some of our female curators who have picked interesting and notable parts of the collection highlighting women in one way or another. From women artists to women in positions of power,\u00a0from the elites to everyday life, read on to discover some of their fascinating stories.\nWomen artists\nReceived wisdom can be very unwise indeed. For centuries, the study of art history has favoured male artists. So to begin our story, Jill Cook, Keeper of Britain, Europe and Prehistory, dispels the myth of women artists as \u2018recent\u2019 in this video on women artists from the Ice Age:\nAs Jill says, \u2018Recognising that female images made 35\u201320,000 years ago may be made by women, for women, rebalances ideas of women\u2019s roles in our deep history.\u2019\nMoving forward a few thousand years or so, Dora Thornton, Curator of Renaissance collections, has picked this dish.\nApollo and the Muses on Mount Helicon. Painted enamel on copper with gilding. Limoges, France, c.\u00a01600.\nMade in Europe around 1600, it is a rare example of a work signed by a woman \u2013 Susanne Court. Susanne\u2019s family, from Limoges in France, was famous for its skill in the difficult technique of painted enamel on copper. It is stunningly decorated with the goddesses of the arts making music, and demonstrates Court\u2019s rich gilding, jewel-like colours and pale flesh tones.\nCurator of British prints and drawings Kim Sloan has chosen to highlight the work of Mary Delany (1700\u20131788) who made nearly a thousand of these botanically accurate pieces using tiny pieces of coloured paper glued onto a black background.\nMary Delany (1700\u20131788),\u00a0Passiflora laurifolia (Gynandria pentandria). Collage of coloured papers, with bodycolour and watercolour, on black ink background, 1777.\nModelled on flowers sent by friends from around the world, she only began making them at the age of 72!\nCurator of contemporary art Jennifer Ramkalawon has a personal account of the work she\u2019s picked \u2013 Hope Bryan\u2019s Three Figures:\nI went to Diana Gurney\u2019s house in 2014 as she wanted to donate the work of her friend Hope Bryan to the Museum. They had studied together at Westminster School of Art in the 1930s. I was really struck by the work and immediately accepted it \u2013 I spent a wonderful afternoon with Diana as she reminisced about her friend \u2013 she was so sad they had lost contact as Bryan had emigrated to Canada in the early 50s. So the piece is about one artist donating the work of a dear friend. By presenting Bryan\u2019s works to the Museum, it was a way of honouring her friend.\nHope Bryan (b. c. 1915), Three figures. Wood engraving, c. 1940-1951.\nThe following two pieces are by American artists and both are about to go on display in two exhibitions \u2013 The American Dream at the British Museum\u00a0(until 18 June) and Lines of thought at the Ulster Museum (until 7 May).\nLeft: Kiki Smith (b. 1954), Born. Colour lithograph, 2002. \u00a9 Kiki Smith/Universal Limited Art Editions. Right: Julie Mehretu (b. 1970),\u00a0Untitled. Ink on vellum and mylar, 2002. \u00a9 Julie Mehretu. Reproduced by permission of the artist.\nKiki Smith\u2018s work deals with representations of women in art, religion, literature and popular culture. This work, entitled Born, was chosen by Exhibition Project Curator Catherine Daunt. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother emerge from the stomach of the wolf. Did it eat them? Were they rescued by an unseen (male) hero? In fairy tales, a female protagonist is often endangered when she strays from the \u2018correct\u2019 path. Here, the girl and her grandmother have been given a second chance.\nThis scintillating drawing by Julie Mehretu\u00a0enacts a dialogue between tracings from architectural plans and the artist\u2019s own gestures. Isabel Seligman, Project Curator for the Bridget Riley Art Foundation, says that both are layered in ink on the transparent Mylar\u00a0(a polyester film) on top of one another, as a kind of palimpsest. Mehretu has described her works as operating like \u2018narrative maps without a specific place or location\u2019, and the range of marks evokes everything from contours and isobars to clouds, ripples and waves.\nPowerful women\nWomen have held power throughout history, in a variety of ways. Curators Amelia Dowler and Vesta Curtis have picked coins that depict\u00a0women who achieved a couple of \u2018firsts\u2019.\nCoins of Queens\u00a0Amastris (above) and Boran\u00a0(below).\nAmastris (d. 284 BC) is the first woman ever to be named on a coin \u2013 here as \u2018Queen Amastris\u2019. The image, however, is probably of the Persian god Mithras or the Anatolian god M\u00ean. The reverse shows the Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite, holding Nike, goddess of victory. Despite a tumultuous life (she was married three times: to a general, a tyrant, and a king \u2013\u00a0and then murdered by her own sons), Amastris wielded great political power in northern Asia Minor. She used her power over neighbouring cities to bring four of them together into a new political entity and named it \u2018Amastris\u2019. This city still exists as the modern town of Amasra in northern Turkey.\nThe silver coin underneath, from AD 630, depicts Queen Boran \u2013\u00a0the first Iranian queen to rule in her own right. She wears a winged crown topped by a moon crescent and a globe, symbols of divine kingly glory. Her long braids indicate that she is a woman.\nCurator Aur\u00e9lia Masson-Berghoff has decided to focus on this beautiful gilded faience head, which depicts the queen of Egypt Arsinoe II.\u00a0Like the famous Cleopatra VII, Arsinoe was a powerful royal woman of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a Greco-Macedonian dynasty which ruled over Egypt for almost 300 years (305\u201330 BC).\nGilded faience head of Arsinoe II. Naukratis, Egypt, 3rd century BC.\nArsinoe was the eldest daughter of Ptolemy I, the founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty. In a third wedding, she married her brother Ptolemy II, who promoted the worship of his sister-wife after her death. She was sometimes recognised by Egyptians as Isis, mother goddess and patron of magic, and was worshipped extensively by Egyptians and Greeks alike. By royal decree, a statue of her\u00a0had to be placed in every temple in Egypt.\nEngland\u2019s Queen Elizabeth I is renowned for being a steely ruler and Curator Sarah Vowles, has chosen this portrait of her, made in 1575, 17 years into her reign.\nFederico Zuccaro (c. 1542\u20131609), Portrait of Queen Elizabeth I\u00a0(detail). Black and red chalk, 1575.\nThe artist has portrayed her as shrewd, calm and self-contained. In the background, symbols refer to her virtues: fortitude (a pillar), prudence (a serpent), chastity (an ermine) and fidelity (a dog).\nPowerful women weren\u2019t always royal, of course. Curator Sue Brunning has chosen this sorceress\u2019s staff to illustrate powerful Viking women.\nIron staff, from a woman\u2019s grave at Villa Farm, M\u00f8re og Romsdal, Vestnes, Norway, AD 900s.\nSue says:\nOld Norse writings describe women known as v\u00f6lur using staffs in mysterious magical practices involving divination, speaking to the dead and controlling others. Burials of possible v\u00f6lur hint that people feared these women \u2013 their staffs were often bent, broken or weighed down in their graves so they couldn\u2019t be used again. However, they were also respected and often buried with fine artefacts \u2013 this rod\u2019s owner was honoured with an earth mound, suggesting she would be remembered forever.\nYou can also\u00a0read more about powerful Viking women in this blog post by Judith Jesch, Professor of Viking Studies at the University of Nottingham.\nMoving across the world to India, Sushma Jansari is currently curating the newly refurbished Sir Joseph Hotung Gallery of China and South Asia (Room 33), due to reopen in November 2017. She has picked as her object an inscription on a capital\u00a0that will feature in the new gallery. Sushma explains:\nWomen were important benefactors to Buddhist sites in South Asia and inscriptions record their generous donations. A famous example is found on a lion-shaped capital from Mathura in central India that dates to around AD 100. The inscription records the donation of a monastery and Buddha relic by Yasi Kamui, main wife of Rajuvula, the Indo-Scythian Great Governor.\nRed sandstone pillar capital. Indo-Scythian, made in Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India, 1st century AD.\nWomen\u2019s everyday lives\nOver time and across the world, what it means to be a woman has constantly changed. Sometimes, though, history throws up some surprises.\u00a0This bronze statuette of a running girl was chosen by Etruscan Curator Judith Swaddling.\nSpartan running girl, c. 520-500 BC.\nIt\u00a0was probably made in Sparta where, unusually for ancient Greece, women were expected to take part in athletics. Strong mothers were believed to produce good soldiers. Women could not compete in the Olympic Games, but they had a festival of their own at Olympia, called the Heraia. There was only one event, the foot-race, and this girl\u2019s appearance corresponds well with Pausanias\u2019 description of those taking part. The statuette would have been one of several decorating the rim of a bronze vessel and she seems to be looking back to see how close her competitors are.\nJumping ahead a few centuries to Iron Age Britain, Julia Farley, Curator of British and European Iron Age collections, reflects on\u00a0the St Keverne mirror\u00a0and how it might have been used.\nThe St Keverne Mirror. Found in Cornwall, Iron Age, c. 120\u201380 BC.\nJulia says:\nOften, we only know that an Iron Age object was used by a woman if it comes from a grave. One of my favourites is the St Keverne mirror, buried with a woman in Cornwall around 50 BC. The front of the bronze mirror was polished, and the back is engraved with swirling designs that seem to play on the idea of reflection, of dark and light. In a world where most people only saw their reflections in water, a mirror would have seemed powerful, perhaps even magical. I like to think about the woman who owned it. Who was she? What did she see when she gazed into the strange, distorted reflection in the metal? Herself? Or something more?\nVery much not an object, this body of a naturally mummified woman was found during 2005 rescue excavations at the Fourth Nile Cataract in Sudan.\nMummy of a woman from Sudan, c. AD 700, and the detail of her tattoo.\nCurator Marie Vandenbeusch takes a closer look:\nThe study of this woman\u2019s\u00a0skin revealed a tattoo in the shape of a monogram of St Michael, placed on her inner thigh. It combines in one symbol the letters forming the name Michael (MIXAH\u039b) in Greek or Coptic, finished with a cross. The tattoo suggests that the woman was of Christian faith. She might have hoped to place herself under the protection of the Archangel \u2013 one of the patron saints of Nubia.\nSarah Jaffrey, Bridget Riley Art Foundation project officer, has highlighted a print of artist Mary Cassatt, seen here leaning confidently on her umbrella in the middle of the Louvre\u2019s Etruscan gallery while her sister Lydia looks on from behind her guide book.\nEdgar Degas (1834\u20131917), Mary Cassatt at the Louvre: the Etruscan Gallery.\u00a0Soft-ground etching, drypoint, aquatint and etching,\u00a01879\u20131880.\nSarah explains the significance of this drawing, and why it illustrates the changing role for some women in 19th-century Europe:\nIt is not a traditional portrait, yet it still conveys Cassatt\u2019s character. As a female artist working in the male-dominated art world of late 19th-century Paris, her work boldly explores a woman\u2019s place in middle class society. Degas depicts this boldness in his portrait by contrasting Cassatt\u2019s assertiveness against the timidity of her sister. Her physical stance embodies the careful, full-bodied observation required to take on the social complexities explored in her art.\nTwo aspects of how women\u2019s lives changed in the 20th century are shown by this Chinese print, selected by former Curator in the Asia Department Mary Ginsberg, and this Chinese banknote, chosen by Helen Wang, Curator of East Asian money.\nAbove: Training at a Tianjin Girls\u2019 High School, China. Woodblock print in ink and colour on paper, 1920\u20131930. Below: 1-yuan note of the People\u2019s Bank of China, dated 1960.\nIn the early 20th century, some prints in this folk-art style urged social reforms \u2013 including better education as well as social, political and military participation for girls. Here, five girls are being drilled with their rifles by a female instructor. However, Mary says that \u2018it probably represents wishful thinking more than the reality for many girls at the time\u2019. The woman driving the tractor on the banknote is thought to be modelled on Liang Jun, China\u2019s first female tractor driver. She looks strong and healthy \u2013 quite different from more traditional images of Chinese women, and her control of the machinery suggests freedom from oppression. Wearing a clean white shirt, she is clearly not a farm-girl, but a working woman and a member of the proletariat.\nSo often in history, women have been defined by what they wear. Curator Eleanor S Hyun \u00a0has picked this\u00a0hanbok \u2013 the general term for traditional Korean dress, commonly worn until the mid-20th\u00a0century.\nWoman\u2019s hanbok\u00a0and Jang\u2019ot. Choi Bokhee (1930\u20132008), South Korea, 1980s.\nEleanor explains their importance:\nWomen\u2019s hanbok consist of a jeogori (short jacket) and chima (skirt). The one on display of a blue chima with floral patterns and chartreuse jeogori would have been an everyday outfit for a wealthy woman. A Jang\u2019ot was worn by women of the Joseon period (1392\u20131910) as a veil and head covering. Adhering to the Confucian principles of modesty and decorum, women wore jang\u2019ot when traveling outdoors to shield their appearance from unfamiliar men. This is a modern reproduction based on a Joseon example in the Onyang Folk Museum.\nAlso focusing on the importance of clothing in different societies, these wedding slippers from Ghadamis Oasis, Libya, have been chosen by Curator Fahmida Suleman.\nA pair of bride\u2019s wedding slippers.\u00a0Ghadamis Oasis, Libya, 1960s\u20131970s.\nFahmida says:\nI love these hand-stitched and silk embroidered red leather wedding slippers (tarkasin) from Libya. The tongues are cut in the shape of a protective hand called a khamsa or \u2018Hand of Fatima\u2019, which protect the bride from the \u2018evil eye\u2019 or the \u2018eye of envy\u2019. The metal studs also deflect harmful forces, keeping her safe.\nHopefully this brief list scratches the surface of how women are an integral part of the collection, as makers, artists, subjects and users. As with any list, there is never enough space to include everything. What objects would you have picked from the collection? What objects related to women\u2019s history, or by women artists, should be in the Museum\u2019s collection but aren\u2019t?

Made possible through a \u00a32.9 million grant from the UK\u2019s Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Scheme provides Iraqi archaeologists with the expertise and skills they need to face the challenges of documenting and stabilising severely disrupted and damaged heritage sites in their country.\nThe Iraq Training Scheme provides a long-term sustainable solution that will train a total of 50 archaeologists over five years. The idea is that they will then go on to share their skills in retrieval and rescue archaeology across Iraq. This is already happening at Nimrud and other sites in Ninawa (Nineveh) Province.\n\u2018We wanted to do something positive and constructive in the face of the most appalling destruction that had been going on.\u2019 Iraq Scheme Director, Jonathan Tubb, British Museum\nThe six-month training scheme sees Iraqi archaeologists spend three months in London and three months in Iraq.\u00a0The UK-based part of the programme is largely undertaken at the British Museum. It introduces participants to the challenges facing cultural heritage, the legal aspects of cultural heritage protection, and the value of heritage conventions in combating illicit trade of antiquities. Participants are also trained in the use of satellite imagery and digital mapping, as well as tools for documenting buildings and monuments.\nThe three months in Iraq are spent on fieldwork, where the participants can put what they have learned in theory into practice. The British Museum has secured excavation permits for two sites in Iraq: Tello (ancient Girsu), a well-known and important Sumerian site in the south, and Darband-I Rania, a previously unexplored cluster of closely related sites in the Sulaimaniya province of Iraqi Kurdistan. These two sites provide the fieldwork venues for the duration of the Scheme.\nAssessment of the site at Tello.\nAs a result of the training and the Scheme\u2019s profile, one of the trainees has now been appointed by the Iraqi State Board to lead the archaeological assessment of the Late Assyrian capital at Nimrud, and other sites in the area recently released from the control of Daesh*. The trainee was undertaking archaeological work at Tello when Nimrud was liberated by the Iraqi army in 2016. He and a team of 10 archaeologists, including other participants from the Scheme, travelled to Nimrud in November 2016. They began assessing and documenting the damage done to the site and its world-class Assyrian reliefs. This work is ongoing, and another trainee is working to assess other damage done at the later Assyrian capital of Khorsabad.\nThese early success stories from the British Museum\u2019s Iraq Training Scheme demonstrate the value of hands-on training for colleagues. The Scheme provides them with the skills required to conserve, restore and preserve sites and objects that are both part of Iraq\u2019s rich archaeological heritage and of global significance.\n*Please note that throughout this article we have used the Arabic acronym Daesh to refer to the group often referred to in the media as IS, ISIS, ISIL or \u2018so-called Islamic State\u2019."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/world-book-day-leafing-through-the-pages-of-history/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "World Book Day: leafing through the pages of history", "author": "British Museum and Andrew Shore", "timestamp": "2017-03-02 00:00:00", "text": "What does the British Museum have to do with books? The British Library may have moved out in 1997 but there\u2019s more to books and reading than just the books themselves. Manuscripts, codices, papyri \u2013 even clay tablets have transmitted words across the ages. Read on for a short exploration of a few book-related beauties\u2026\nBeer and libraries: the perfect mix\nClay tablet recording beer given to workers. The symbol for beer is included three times \u2013 an upright jar with a pointed base. Mesopotamia, 3100\u20133000 BC.\nThe Babylonians were trailblazers in many fields, including writing. This clay tablet was made around 3100\u20133000 BC in Mesopotamia (now southern Iraq) and features a form of writing called cuneiform. Cuneiform was some of the oldest writing in the world, but was likely created not for letters, literature or scripture, but for accountancy. This tablet records beer given to workers as part of their daily rations.\nPart of the library of Ashurbanipal on display in Room 55. Nineveh, northern Iraq, 7th century BC.\nThe oldest surviving royal library is also from this part of the world. Ashurbanipal, King of Assyria (r. 668\u2013c. 630 BC), collected a library of thousands of cuneiform tablets in his palace at Nineveh. It included letters, legal texts, lists of people, animals and goods, and a wealth of scientific information, as well as myths and legends. The best known of these was the Epic of Gilgamesh, which features a great flood, prompting scholars to link the character of Utnapishtim with the Biblical Noah and his Ark.\nEvery picture tells a story\nBook of the Dead of Hunefer. Ancient Egypt, 19th Dynasty.\nUsually when we think of books today, we imagine plenty of words. However, throughout history people have also used images to tell stories.\u00a0This papyrus is from an ancient Egyptian \u2018Book of the Dead\u2019 belonging to a royal scribe who lived around 1200 BC. The \u2018Book\u2019 was not a single text but a compilation of spells designed to guide the deceased through the dangers of the underworld, ultimately ensuring eternal life. In this scene you can also see some hieroglyphs telling the story.\nMixtec codex comprising 47 leaves, made of deer skin. Mexico, c. 1200\u20131521.\nThis is a scene from an incredibly rare Mixtec codex, made in Mexico before 1521. A codex is a book made up of handwritten pages. The whole document contains two narratives, starting at opposite ends of the book. The first describes the marriages and the political and military achievements of the awesomely named 11th-century ruler Lord Eight Deer Jaguar-Claw, and the second tells the history of Mixtec religious centres.\nWriting on other things\nBefore societies became literate, stories were transmitted orally \u2013 by word of mouth, but also by putting scenes on objects. One example from ancient Greece is this depiction of the sirens and Odysseus from Homer\u2019s Odyssey.\nSilver coin. Minted in England, c. AD 10\u201340.\nWriting began in Britain in about 50 BC \u2013 around the time of Julius Caesar\u2019s invasion. Imitating the Romans, powerful Celtic kings who ruled in south-east England had their names put on their coins. We don\u2019t know whether ancient Britons did much writing elsewhere \u2013 nothing has really survived, certainly no books or manuscripts \u2013 nor whether many of them were able to read what the coins said. This coin names a ruler called Verica and calls him REX \u2013 the Latin word for king.\nAfter the Romans had conquered Britain, they brought Latin with them, and a literate society. The Vindolanda tablets are a remarkable time capsule from the era of Roman rule. They were a series of letters written to and from people who lived in the fort of Vindolanda on Hadrian\u2019s Wall. They even include a birthday party invitation! You can see a selection on display in Room 49.\nIllustrating books\nUtagawa Kunisada (1786\u20131864), illustration to The Tale of Genji. Woodblock print, 1868.\nSome people think that The Tale of Genji was the world\u2019s first novel. Written in AD 1007 by Murasaki Shikibu in Japan, it was still popular in the 19th century, when this print was made. It\u2019s one of a series of over 50 accompanying the story, made by Utagawa Kunisada.\nThe prophet Elias (Elijah) rescuing Prince Nur ad-Dahr from drowning in a river. Opaque watercolour on cloth, India, 1556\u20131579.\nThis illustration is from the Hamzanama (\u2018Book of Hamza\u2019), a heroic romance about the legendary adventures of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s uncle, Amir Hamza. The young Mughal emperor Akbar (r. 1556\u20131605) enjoyed listening to the tales of the Hamzanama at his court, and in 1562 he ordered his artists to produce an illustrated version. The project took more than\u00a015 years and had over 1,400 paintings!\nWestern books have also been hugely associated with their illustrators. Lewis Carroll\u2019s \u2018Alice\u2019 books were originally illustrated by John Tenniel, influencing how many thought of the stories.\nBeatrix Potter (1866\u20131943), an illustration for page 8 of The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies. Drawing in pen and ink with watercolour, 1909.\nPerhaps one of the most famous illustrator-authors is Beatrix Potter. Her short stories and illustrations continue to prove as popular as ever thanks to the enduring charm of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny. The full set of original 1909 watercolours for \u2018The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies\u2019 is in the Museum\u2019s collection.\nBook bling\nSilver book covers. Made in Ulm, Germany, c. 1506.\nThese silver book covers once decorated the Book of Epistles and the Book of Gospels on the altar of the Minster in Ulm, Germany. The Epistles cover (on the left) has the symbols of the four Evangelists with St Antony the Hermit and St Vincent. The Gospels cover (on the right) has the Virgin and Child with St Martin, Bishop of Tours, and the Empress Helena.\nParadise scene, spread over two leaves, on the frontispiece to the Amit\u0101bha S\u016btra (illuminated manuscript of a Buddhist sutra). Goryeo Dynasty, Korea, 1341.\nDuring the Goryeo\u00a0dynasty\u2018s rule in Korea (AD 918\u20131392), the copying of Buddhist sutras was considered to have great spiritual benefit. The handwritten copies (sagyong) were made with great skill and care in calligraphy, usually by monk-scribes. This sutra manuscript has a dazzling frontispiece, spread over two leaves, and painted in gold. It shows the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni, flanked by bodhisattvas and monks preaching to deities and other Buddhas.\nA bookplate, or Ex libris, is a small print for pasting inside the cover of a book to express ownership. The first books were highly valuable and prestigious objects to own, and the first bookplates usually incorporated the coats of arms of the fabulously wealthy. By the late 19th century, bookplates had developed into a highly imaginative miniature form. This lovely\u00a0book presents beautiful examples of the neglected art form by leading artists, from D\u00fcrer to Edward Burne-Jones.

The earliest object will date from around 9000 BC, the latest from our own time. It won\u2019t come as a surprise to many that the Museum can come up with objects from the distant past. But what may be surprising is that the Museum\u2019s collection also includes large numbers of much more recent objects \u2013 objects that throw light on the way we live today.\nAmong the modern everyday objects in the Museum\u2019s collection are some 13,000 badges. Most come from the UK, but there are also a good number from the Unites States, and over 50 other countries are also represented. Included in these modern badges are around 400 that relate to LGBTQ experience.\nHow did these badges come to be in the British Museum? Ever since its foundation in 1753 the Museum has collected commemorative medals. The first modern-style button badges to enter the collection arrived in 1906 along with a large group of such medals. These badges had been made a few years earlier in support of British forces fighting in the Boer . At the time this sort of badge was a relatively new invention, but, because they were cheap to make, they came to dominate the 20th century, taking over the roles of the earlier medals. That the button badge was in effect the new medal was recognised in 1906 by both the collector who gave them to us, Frederick Parkes Weber, and the Museum itself.\nThe rise of protest movements in western countries in the 1960s and 1970s gave badges a new lease of life. For example, in the UK Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), badges were produced in huge quantities. Meanwhile the Museum had continued over the years to acquire badges in a piecemeal way through occasional gifts. Then in the late 1970s the decision was taken to collect more proactively and the number of badges began to grow rapidly. As there was no money available, it was a matter of encouraging donations, and we found that people were extraordinarily generous.\nThe first lesbian and gay badges arrived in the Museum in 1978 as part of a large gift of 258 political badges from an individual collector: \u2018How dare you presume I\u2019m heterosexual\u2019 and \u2018Lesbians ignite\u2019 were among the slogans. As a junior member of staff in the Department of Coins and Medals, I was put in charge of the collection in the early 1980s, and one of the first things I did was to donate some badges of my own. These included \u2018Gay News fights on!\u2019, from the 1977 campaign against the newspaper\u2019s conviction for blasphemous libel (a crime that no longer exists) and a \u2018Gay whales against racism\u2019 badge. While the latter is appealing on account of its humour, it\u2019s also informative in that it shows that when it was made in 1980 or thereabouts, gay rights were up there along with Save the Whale and anti-racism as a visible campaign very much in the public eye.\nLeft: Lesbians ignite. A Gay Liberation Front badge, about 1972. Right: How dare you presume I\u2019m heterosexual. A Gay Liberation Front badge, about 1972.\nLeft: Gay News fights on! A Gay News Fighting Fund badge, 1977. Right: Gay whales against racism. A Badge Shop badge, about 1980.\n\u2018Finance AIDS research\u2019 \u2013 arrived in 1985, and was followed quickly by many others that act as a reminder that the gay community was at the forefront in campaigning for funding and greater understanding of the disease. The campaign against Section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act, which banned local authorities from \u2018promoting homosexuality\u2019, is also well represented, including a group of badges presented in May 1989 by Trades Unionists Against Section 28. Gifts of badges from the organisations that issued them have always been especially welcome, as this means that they come well documented: we know who is responsible for distributing them, we know when, and, importantly, the badges are all in good condition.\nLeft: Abseil against Section 28. A Trades Unionists Against Section 28 badge, 1989. Right: Finance AIDS research. About 1985.\nThe Museum continues to collect badges, recognising them as a mirror of the times. The badge has always been especially important for the lesbian and gay movement, for visibility has been a central issue since the early days of campaigning. As Jeffrey Weeks wrote in his book Coming out, published in 1977, \u2018\u201cComing out\u201d was the first and most obvious change \u2026 You were encouraged to wear badges \u2026 asserting your homosexuality.\u2019 The badges now in the Museum\u2019s collection document the activities and campaigns that have led to the astonishing transformation in both social attitudes and the legal status of lesbians and gay men that has happened in the UK over the last few decades. They are also a lasting tribute to the members of the LGBTQ community who both individually and collectively helped to bring this transformation about.\nThe British Museum is generally associated with its stupendous collection of antiquities and treasures from around the world, with less attention paid to the millions of smaller, less exalted objects. And yet these objects also have stories to tell \u2013 stories that are no less revealing about the societies that produced them than those of the more obviously impressive sculptures and other great works of art."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-british-museums-list-of-15-things-you-should-know-about-andy-warhol/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "The British Museum\u2019s list of 15 things you should know about Andy Warhol", "author": "British Museum and Andrew Shore", "timestamp": "2017-02-22 00:00:00", "text": "1. He was born Andrew Warhola in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of working-class immigrants from Czechoslovakia.\nHe changed his name to Warhol about the time he graduated in pictorial design from Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh, in 1949.\n2. Before he became a famous artist, he had a successful career as a commercial graphic designer.\nWarhol moved to New York in 1949 and during the 1950s he worked for fashion magazines, Manhattan department stores and for I Miller, a women\u2019s shoe company.\n3. He coined the widely used expression: \u2018fifteen minutes of fame\u2019.\nThe expression was inspired by Andy Warhol\u2019s words \u2018In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes\u2019, which appeared in the programme for a 1968 exhibition of his work in Stockholm, Sweden.\n4. In 1962 Warhol burst on to the New York art scene with his serial images of America.\nCampbell\u2019s soup cans provided early inspiration for Warhol. Giuliano Del Moretto/Shutterstock, Inc.\nHe used mass advertising, the news media and the movies as inspiration. Emulating the method of a mass-production line, Warhol created a stream of paintings and prints of Campbell\u2019s soup cans, horrific car crashes, Coca-Colas, Elvis Presleys and Marilyn Monroes (see below for more of her\u2026). His unashamed use of pop culture references became a key element in the movement that became known as \u2018pop art\u2019.\n5. His studio was called The Factory \u2013 a reference to the mass-produced nature of his artworks.\nThe American artist Andy Warhol sitting in his studio. Some paintings depict Jacqueline Kennedy. New York, 1964. Photo by Mario De Biasi/Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images.\nThe Factory was a well-known gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals, drag queens, playwrights, Bohemian street people, Hollywood celebrities, and wealthy patrons. The Factory was, in fact, located in three different places in New York City between 1962 and 1984. The name was apt \u2013 Warhol made more than 400 print editions, almost all screenprints, with various publishers throughout his life.\n6. He used press and publicity photos as source material in his work.\nThe assassination of President John F Kennedy on 22 November 1963 shocked America and the world, and the event replayed continuously on television and in the press. In 1963/64, Warhol began his series of screenprinted, multiple-imaged paintings of the president\u2019s widow, Jackie Kennedy, using pictures by Fred Ward from Life magazine (6 December 1963).\nAndy Warhol\u2019s \u00a0Jackie II\u00a0in the Prints and Drawings Study Room.\nThe colour screenprint Jackie II, made in 1966, is on show in the exhibition The American Dream: pop to the present. In it, Warhol presents the veiled widow isolated in her bereavement in front of the world\u2019s press. The coarse dots of the news photo are enlarged by photoscreenprinting to the point that her image appears to break up. The repetition of Jackie in black against a flat, metallic purple surface reinforces the subject\u2019s tragic dimension.\n7. His most expensive work sold to date fetched $105.4 million at auction in 2013.\nThe painting in question, Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster), shows a twisted body in the wreckage of a car crash, part of Warhol\u2019s Death and Disaster series, painted in 1963.\n8. His Marilyn Monroe diptych was voted one of the most influential works of modern art.\nAndy Warhol\u2019s series of 10 Marilyns being installed in the exhibition The American Dream: pop to the present.\nOne of the most recognisable images in the world, Warhol\u2019s Marilyn series remains sensational after five\u00a0decades. He made the series of 10 individual screenprints, shown here being installed into our American Dream exhibition, in 1967. Warhol used a cropped and enlarged publicity still as the source image for this work, taken by photographer Gene Kornman for Monroe\u2019s 1953 film Niagara. Behind the glamour and fame of the Marilyn series lay tragedy. Recently divorced from playwright\u00a0Arthur Miller, Marilyn had taken her own life with a drug overdose in August 1962. Warhol\u2019s depiction of the alluring screen goddess became a memorial to a fallen idol.\n9. Apart from creating graphic art, he also made more than 60 films, created the fashion magazine Interview, and wrote several books.\nHe also created around 500 \u2018screen test\u2019 portraits of visitors to the Factory \u2013 these were black-and-white short films.\n10. He put the \u2018pop\u2019 into pop art \u2013 in more ways than one.\nAlthough not musical himself, he was credited as the producer of The Velvet Underground and Nico\u2019s eponymous first album, for which he designed the iconic banana cover. He also designed The Rolling Stones\u2019 Sticky Fingers album (a close-up shot of a model wearing jeans, complete with zip fly) and even hosted a programme on MTV between 1985 and 1987 called Andy Warhol\u2019s Fifteen Minutes. He features in the songs \u2018Andy Warhol\u2019 (on David Bowie\u2019s Hunky Dory) and \u2018Andy\u2019s Chest\u2019 (on Lou Reed\u2019s Transformer \u2013 inspired by the 1968 attempt on the artist\u2019s life).\n11. Warhol believed that his depiction of President Nixon led to him being investigated by the IRS.\nAndy Warhol (1928\u20131987), Vote McGovern. Screenprint, 1972. \u00a9 2016 The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc./Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York and DACS, London.\nFor the 1972 presidential election Warhol made this print as a fundraiser in support of the Democratic candidate Senator George McGovern. Warhol pictured Richard Nixon, McGovern\u2019s Republican opponent, with a livid green face, yellow lips and demonic orange eyes.\nWarhol lifted the source image from a photo of the President and his wife on the front cover of Newsweek. He transferred the green colour of Mrs Nixon\u2019s outfit to her husband\u2019s face.\nWarhol later complained that the print had so enraged Nixon that he was placed under continuous scrutiny by the Internal Revenue Service for tax audits, prompting him to begin his now-famous diaries as a daily log of expenditure.\n12. He\u2019s not all about pop culture and witty sayings \u2013 there\u2019s a serious message in some of his works\nThis print\u00a0uses a photograph of the riots that began in Birmingham, Alabama, as part of the civil rights movement. First published in Life magazine on 17 May 1963, the photo had been taken by press photographer Charles Moore two weeks earlier. It was the first time Warhol appropriated a current news photograph in his printmaking. He instructed the screenprinter to heighten the contrast between black and white in order to reinforce the message about race relations.\n13. He considered all of life \u2013 and death \u2013 as a suitable subject for his art.\nWarhol began to produce his screenprinted Electric Chair paintings in 1963, the year of the State of New York\u2019s last execution by electric chair. He used a press service photo (published 13 January 1953) of the electric chair at the infamous Sing Sing Prison, Ossining, New York, as his source image.\u00a0The empty chair sits in the chilling stillness of the chamber of death.\nAndy Warhol\u2019s Electric Chair series (1971). Radu Bercan/Shutterstock, Inc. The series will be on display in The American Dream: pop to the present (in a different arrangement to that shown here).\nWarhol returned to the electric chair image in 1971 for a set of prints, which will be on display in the exhibition The American Dream: pop to the present. He repeated the source image he had used for his earlier screenprinted canvases. In these prints, however, the electric chair is positioned more prominently by cropping the source image. This has the effect of enlarging the chair, reducing the sense of being in an enclosed room. In this respect the prints are closer to his so-called Big Electric Chair paintings of 1967. The serial presentation of ten identical images in both positive and negative iterations and in different colour combinations has a hallucinatory, hypnotic effect on the viewer.\n14. 2017 marks 30 years since his death.\nHe died on 22 February 1987 from a sudden post-operative cardiac arrhythmia following gall bladder surgery. He was just 58.\n15.\u00a0There is an Andy Warhol Museum in his native city \u2013 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nIt is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-british-museum-membercast-joan-of-arc/", "category": "Podcasts", "title": "The British Museum Membercast: Joan of Arc", "author": "British Museum and Andrew Shore", "timestamp": "2017-02-21 00:00:00", "text": "Featuring snippets from Helen\u2019s sell-out Members\u2019 lecture in November last year, the third episode of Membercast examines the woman at the heart of the myth of Joan of Arc.

Leonard Woolley. Those of you who read the previous blog post on the cauldron\u00a0will remember that the cauldron, initially a sorry sight, yielded a surprising amount of information, even allowing a speculative suggestion about its provenance.\nThe blog concluded with the suggestion that more information could be gained through further study, X-radiography and analysis.\nBalancing the need for a comprehensive investigation against the fact that there were many objects requiring assessment and treatment for the project, led to a decision to adopt a minimal approach to the conservation of the cauldron. In its current storage (in controlled environmental conditions) and supportive packing, the object is stable and the likelihood of further deterioration is reduced. In addition, much information may be gleaned from a non-interventive approach to treatment.\nAs mentioned in the previous post, the cauldron is lined with a layer of waxed calico on the interior (over a layer of soil) and partially lined on the exterior. The waxy lining is one of the few remaining examples of an excavation practice frequently used by Woolley and is therefore a physical document of this process \u2013 part of the object\u2019s history. This material and the concreted soil have probably prevented the complete collapse of the cauldron. However, this also means that the cauldron interior and underside are obscured.\nConservator working on the\u00a0large copper alloy cauldron.\nOne of the most widely used non-interventive investigative tools in conservation is X-radiography. This produces a visual record of the form and structure of objects, when soil and corrosion products (and waxed calico!) obscure surfaces. X-radiography may also provide valuable evidence of metal-working processes, and of decorative features.\nDetail of handle fittings.\nBefore studying the cauldron bowl, the detached cauldron handles were X-radiographed and a number of interesting features were revealed. In an X-ray, a lighter tone indicates the presence of denser metal. \u00a0This may be seen in the handles of the cauldron and is particularly noticeable in the three rivets on each handle fixing. The halo of a similar light tone that surrounds each rivet first suggested a form of spacer or washer. However, this is most likely to be the splayed outer or inner faces of the rivets, hammered flat.\nX-radiograph of the cauldron handles and section of rim.\nOn the right handle fixing, on the upper right, what appears to be a stress fracture from original working is visible.\u00a0 When cold-working metal, the material has to be repeatedly annealed (heated and cooled) to keep it malleable, otherwise it becomes brittle and fractures, as has happened here.\nAs the X-radiograph above demonstrates, the rim section, although more deteriorated than the handles, can be seen to have horizontal striations, that is, a banded or striped effect. It is likely that this demonstrates different densities of metal and therefore could indicate the way in which the metal was extended and formed through continuous sequential rows of hammering. Much of the shoulder of the vessel is missing, so it is not known whether the rim and body of the vessel were formed of separate pieces of metal, as there are no traces of rivets or seams. However, vessels of this type were usually formed from a single sheet.\nSome features of the handles were identifiable without X-radiography. It was obvious, for example, from their physical appearance that a considerable amount of solid metal survived in them.\u00a0 Cleaning the rivets of the handle; the physical removal of corrosion from their surface, would also have allowed the form of the rivets to be identified, had this particular investigative approach been taken.\nMost exciting, however, were the results of the X-radiographs of the cauldron bowl. These revealed that the cauldron had what must have been an almost perfectly circular base attached to its underside.\u00a0 Part of this is very corroded and fragmented, but much survives intact. The precision of the curve of the circle is impressive and the crisp line suggests that it may have been cut with knife or shears.\u00a0 The large, precisely spaced square rivets are very similar in appearance to those of the handles. The base also appeared to be raised (hammered to shape over an anvil or former) to form a shallow foot.\nLeft: X-radiograph of a section of the cauldron bowl. The X-radiography plate was not large enough to include the entire cauldron. Right: X-radiograph of cauldron bowl (detail).\nAs mentioned above, copper alloy vessels such as this were usually beaten from a single sheet, and an attached base would have provided additional strength. \u00a0In Woolley\u2019s metal vessel typology, the Type 49 cauldron, of which this is an example (as identified in my previous\u00a0blog post), does not include a riveted base. The closest parallel is Type 9, a round-bottomed vessel, but in this case the base is not riveted but soldered to the underside of the vessel.\nType 49 and Type 9 cauldron profiles. C.L Woolley, Ur Excavations: II, The Royal Cemetery (1934), p.302.\nAlthough just another small step in understanding the cauldron, these revelations about the structure have not previously been recorded and have been hidden for the best part of a century, if not for millennia.\nInvestigation of the traces of mineral-preserved matting and analysis of the crust of sooty deposit around the rim of the cauldron was not possible in this phase of investigation, but hopefully this will be something that will be taken up by conservation and science colleagues in future.\nBody 33, Great Death Pit (PG 1237).\nX-radiography was used on a number of Ur objects in order to identify features of interest that might be obscured, and on occasion, as with the cauldron, this proved valuable.\u00a0 One of the more poignant of these examples was another object with its waxed calico support preserved.\u00a0 This object, unlike the cauldron, has a known provenance within the mid-third millennium BC Royal Tombs from a large grave (PG 1237), named by Woolley as the Great Death Pit. The object is part of a headdress belonging to Body 33, one of the 68 female burials there. Little is visible amidst the obscuring dirt and wax although one or two beads have been cleaned in the past. \u00a0The X-radiograph however, reveals the crushed remains of a three-flowered comb, a common element of the elaborate headdresses found in this burial group. The outline of the comb also features on the schematic drawing of Body 33. Woolley aimed to preserve the integrity of the Ur finds when lifting them and this is a good example of this process.\u00a0 Its poignancy lies in the fact that it is fixed as it was at the point of excavation, retaining a sense of association with its third millennium BC origins.\nLeft: The X-radiograph of the headdress reveals the crushed remains of a three-flowered comb. Right: Little is visible amidst the obscuring dirt and wax although one or two beads have been cleaned in the past.\nA number of objects of this type are held in the British Museum: one,\u00a0a complete headdress along with the remains of the wearer, is on display in Room 56.\nHeaddress from 2600 BC, Ur.

The Levant, c. 10,000 BC.\nIt is not completely clear whether this is a man and a woman, two men or two women, but that\u2019s OK as Valentine\u2019s Day is a time to celebrate love in all its beautiful forms.\nCosmetic jar. Thebes, Egypt, Middle Kingdom, c. 1900\u20131800 BC.\nWhoever you are, you have got to kick it up a notch for that special V-Day date. The ancient Egyptians were no different. This stone cosmetic jar, made around 1900 BC, would have originally held eye paint. Applying make-up was a sexual and erotic act and the monkeys that dangle from the edges of the bowl heighten the drama of application acting as symbols of love and sex (no, really).\nDouble spout pottery jar with two human figures. Nasca, Peru, 100 BC\u2013AD 600.\nThese two figures from a painted Peruvian ceramic jar are clearly in love with each other as each one has a huge smile pasted across their face. It is only when we look at the back of the jar that we see why they are both so happy. For almost 2,000 years they have been locked in a sexual embrace and have never got tired. True love\u2026\nTerracotta lamp with a scene of women engaging in oral sex. Asia Minor (modern Turkey), 1st century AD.\nIn the past homosexual love was imaged on a diverse range of objects. This terracotta lamp was made in what is now Turkey in the 1st century AD and shows two women enjoying oral sex. We don\u2019t know if this was made to titillate men or women (or both).\nMarble busts of the Roman emperor Hadrian and his lover Antinous. Hadrian\u2019s bust is from his Villa at Tivoli, c. AD 125\u2013130. Antinous\u2019 is from the Janiculum Hill in Rome, c. AD 130\u2013140.\nAn ancient relationship we do know a lot about is the one between the Roman emperor Hadrian and his beloved Antinous. Hadrian was devastated when Antinous drowned in the Nile in AD 130.\u00a0Hadrian\u2019s love for Antinous appears to have been deeply felt. Hadrian publically commemorated Antinous in statues set up across the Roman world. Hadrian proclaimed his lover a god, named the city of Antinoopolis after him, and also had his image included on coins which were distributed across the empire.\nArchitectural fragment of a temple frieze carved with human figures. India, 11th century AD.\nThis lusty and provocative architectural fragment probably comes from western India and was made in the 11th century. The acrobatic display of sexual prowess on the left-hand side speaks to a culture of sexual openness that celebrates the act of love. Both scenes are all the more intriguing with the extra bit of information that this frieze originally adorned a temple.\nRomance casket with ivory plaques carved with illustrations from the story of Tristram and Isolde. Germany, 1180\u20131200.\nThe Middle Ages in Europe was a particularly romantic time period. The tale of the affair of Lancelot and Guinevere comes to mind, but another is the tragic love story between Tristram and Isolde. This casket, which was made in Germany in the 12th\u00a0century, is the earliest representation of the tale. Tristram sets off to ask for Isolde\u2019s hand on behalf of the King and on their way back they drink a potion which makes them fall deeply in love with each other. The whole thing eventually falls apart and Tristram is banished forever. (OK, this is probably not great inspiration for Valentine\u2019s Day\u2026)\nGold love ring. Probably made in France or England, 15th century.\nIn the 15th century a man named John Paston was away for a long time and his wife Margaret was forlorn. Margaret wrote to him and sent him a ring. The letter said: \u2018I pray you that you will wear the ring with the image of St Margaret that I sent you for a remembrance till you come home. You have left me such a remembrance that makes me to think upon you both day and night when I would sleep.\u2019 Although the ring above does not have an image of St Margaret, it does carry a playful (and grammatically witty) inscription about love in French, which translates as: \u2018my love is an infinitive which wants to be in the relative\u2019.\nPhyllis riding Aristotle. Engraving, Germany, c. 1485\u20131500.\nSometimes you have to be careful with love, and also what you say about it and who can hear you. This 15th-century engraving shows Phyllis riding the great philosopher Aristotle as if he were an animal. The story goes that Aristotle told the young Alexander (yes, Alexander the Great) that he shouldn\u2019t bother with women and should focus on his work instead. Phyllis having heard this committed herself to seducing Aristotle with the intention of embarrassing him in public.

You can follow the story from the beginning by reading the previous blogs (see links at end of article).\n\nAs the print was previously separated into individual and more manageable sheets, it was much easier to closely examine and document the condition of the print. Each sheet was photographed with normal lighting back and front. We have also taken photos with transmitted light by shining light through the paper to reveal any areas that are thinner and more vulnerable, as well as features such as watermarks, old repairs (which are thicker and appear darker) and pieces that had been added after printing also showed up during this process.\nOne of the sheets on the light box.\u00a0Albrecht D\u00fcrer,\u00a0The Triumphal Arch. 1515\u20131517.\nDetails visible in transmitted light.

These marks are caused by pressure from parts of the wooden blocks that were not inked when the design was printed. We were hoping to be able to see the impression of the watermarks too, but disappointingly these didn\u2019t show up.\nImage of a sheet with light from directly above.\nThe same sheet lit from the side showing \u2018blind stamping\u2019.\nOnce we had documented the sheets in detail, our next task was to remove the old, discoloured adhesive that was making the paper stiff and distorted. Tests had shown that the adhesive was wheat-starch glue \u2013 possibly with some flour. We had learned from our previous tests to remove the linen backing (you can read about the process in Joanna Kosek\u2019s previous article here) that introducing moisture gradually was the best way to soften the adhesive. After testing different methods, we settled on using the same gel we had used previously in order to swell the adhesive and remove it.\nBefore working on a sheet, we referred to the damage map that had been created for each sheet (by marking creases, tears and other remarkable features onto a thin sheet of polyester laid over the print). This allowed us to familiarise ourselves with any particularly tricky areas, so there were no nasty surprises when we started to remove the adhesive.\nWe spread gel over the back of the sheet and, when the adhesive had softened, we could then gently lift it away using tools made from Teflon\u00ae \u2013 the same material applied to frying pans that stops your fried egg from sticking. The gel and smooth surface of the tool helped to prevent the paper from being rubbed and damaged.\nConservators Harry Metcalf and Caroline Barry removing adhesive residues.\nWe had located where there were vulnerable areas and tears, and where the edges of the sheets had been thinned before the print had been assembled. In some places there were little more than a few paper fibres holding the printing ink. In these weaker areas, it was a particularly slow process to remove the old adhesive: patience and a gentle but steady hand were needed. As the adhesive was very thick and discoloured it was quite satisfying (and strangely addictive) to remove the brown gunge and bring the flexibility back to the beautiful hand-made paper.\u00a0 We aimed to leave as many old repairs in place as possible but some were removed if they were causing distortions, or where the adhesive underneath was discoloured.\nInk visible from the back of the sheet where the paper is exceptionally thin.\nRemoving an old repair.\nAfter removing the adhesive we needed to remove any traces of gel. We decided to wash the sheets as this would also remove some of the discolouration and acidity from the paper. This is always a delicate operation: the sheets had to be supported and handled with care, as paper can easily disintegrate or get damaged when wet. After a relaxing bath, the sheets were carefully lifted out of the water and left to dry.\nLowering one of the sheets into a water bath.\nSome of the sheets also had inscriptions in ink, which were slightly sensitive to water and might have faded if the sheets were washed. To protect the ink we applied a special type of wax used in conservation. Unlike normal wax, it changes directly from a solid into a gas and slowly evaporates, leaving no trace on the paper after a few days in a fume cupboard. We used a heated tool which is used for decorating Easter eggs to apply the wax over the ink \u2013 we often have to think creatively in conservation and use tools that have been designed for something else!\nProtecting the ink inscription.\nOnce we have finished washing all of the sheets we will need to look at them again to see if anything more needs to be done before the next stage, such as removing any stubborn adhesive and easing out the creases.

I then managed all treatment details in the studio. During the project Japanese conservators from ACNT visit the British Museum for short periods of time to advise and carry out scroll mounting treatments together with us at the Hirayama Studio.\nIn 2016, the treatment of the Standing Courtesan Reading a Letter, a hanging scroll by Kitagawa Utamaro (1753\u20131806), was completed after three years of treatment.

The painting is in black ink and colour on paper. The techniques are highly accomplished and they show the courtesan\u2019s lavish kimono, the scarlet under-robe, which has a pattern of linen leaves in white tie-dye, and the black coat in tasteful green and white shades which has a design of flocking plovers. In response to her lavish dress, a beautiful kimono fabric was used as a mounting fabric (chu-beri) in the 19th\u00a0century. It shows maple leaves and rice-bag patterns in autumn colours enhanced with delicate embroidery. Some of the leaf patterns had been cut and relocated to make the design fit the mount better.\nOur treatment of the painting involved many hours of consolidation, cleaning, backing removal, and applying new linings, as well as a very complex and intricate conservation of the kimono silk fabric. My predecessor, Keisuke Sugiyama, first masterminded the project with Tim Clark and Iwataro-Yasuhiro Oka as well as Monique Pullan and Anna Harrison, the Museum\u2019s textile conservators. The ACNT conservators involved in the treatment were Makoto Kajitani, Masanobu Yamazaki, Atsushi Mikkaichi, Aya One, Aya Matoba and Jun Imada.

The Palace Museum, based in the Forbidden City in Beijing, last year released a popular series of documentaries showing the behind the scenes work carried out by the many conservators there and we particularly enjoyed this one focusing on the work of their scroll mounters (Chinese commentary again).\nJoanna Kosek (pictured) and Jin Xian Qiu presenting at The First Annual Conference on Appreciation, Collection and Conservation of the Ancient Calligraphy and Paintings of China Academy of Art, Hangzhou.\nJin Xian Qiu and Joanna Kosek with the organisers and other delegates of the International Academic Conference of Chinese Ancient Paintings\u2019 Identification and Conservation at the Renmin University, Beijing.\nThe art of the scrollmounter is complex to master, and training takes around 10 years in a traditional apprenticeship set-up. We in the British Museum are incredibly lucky that Qiu Laoshi has trained up a number of conservators, including Valentina Marabini and myself, who have been with Qiu Laoshi for 13 and 6 years respectively. To learn this traditional Eastern craft here within a Western institution is a truly unique opportunity, made only possible by Qiu Laoshi dedicating her career to conserving the British Museum\u2019s amazing and extensive Chinese paintings collection. She often says that her work enables these paintings to be brought back to life, rejuvenated like a tree in springtime, as they would otherwise be in too poor a condition to display. She really is a national treasure for both China and the UK!\nJin Xian Qiu training her two current students: Valentina Marabini (above) and Carol Weiss (below).\nIn a Western conservation culture that often practices \u2018minimal intervention\u2019 to museum objects, there is no denying that the traditional techniques of the Chinese scroll mounter are highly \u2018interventive\u2019 \u2013 in a full remounting treatment we remove old silk mounts (the borders framing the paintings), wash the paintings, replace old lining papers with new ones, repair missing areas and create new mount surrounds that display the painting beautifully as well as provide a fantastic storage system when rolled up and put away. It is only by this method of remounting paintings every hundred years or so that these paintings can survive for so long and be appreciated by so many generations, but the techniques are of course only safe when practised by a Master mounter such as Qiu Laoshi. Hence the long training process \u2013 Qiu Laoshi describes us as \u2018surgeons\u2019 for paintings \u2013 and the real need to preserve the training techniques themselves in order to preserve these paintings. To learn more, you can read how Valentina supplemented her own scroll mounting training at the Shanghai Museum for a year here, and to get a glimpse at some of the processes involved in a complete remounting treatment, look at this previous blog post.\nJin Xian Qiu preparing lining papers with her two current students Valentina Marabini (right) and Carol Weiss\u00a0(left).\nRecent Chinese scroll mounting projects in the Hirayama Studio have included a beautiful silk handscroll in the style of Han Huang \u97d3\u6ec9, a Ming dynasty silk album leaf painting, and two huge Ming dynasty silk painting hanging scrolls\u00a0that we worked on in collaboration with scroll mounters from the Shanghai Museum,\u00a0\u516b\u4ed9 (Eight Immortals) and\u00a0The Lion and His Keeper.

As a curator, my role is to construct the narrative and to select the objects that will express the different parts of the story that we want to communicate to the visitors. South Africa has one of the richest art histories of any country in the world and a fascinating history and this exhibition introduces that depth and diversity to a British and international audience.

In some ways our approach mirrored that in the Sainsbury African Galleries (Room 25) at the Museum, where works by contemporary artists help to illuminate, mediate and curate the other works in the galleries, which represent longstanding artistic traditions. In the exhibition we applied this approach to a historical narrative in which artists take ownership of South African history, from the deep past to the present day.

Kenyon thought that the skulls were portraits of some of the earliest people to live at Jericho, and was thrilled with this new discovery. The skulls she found had been decorated with plaster to recreate human faces, and had shells as eyes. Some showed traces of paint.\nExplore the Jericho skull in 3D\nThe Jericho Skull\nAt the time this person was alive, around 9,500 years ago, Jericho was one of the largest settlements in the Middle East. Mourning the dead was one of the shared rituals that helped bind the society together. Initially each plastered skull would have been a known individual, but as time passed they likely became ancestor figures who may have been worshipped. It\u2019s thought they were safely reburied as portraits of community forebears long after their individual identities were forgotten.\nFinding out more about the person underneath the plaster was challenging \u2013 the soil packing the inside of the cranium meant little internal detail could be made out using conventional X-rays. Museum Curator Alexandra Fletcher brought together a team of researchers in order to discover more about the skull \u2013 experts in studying human remains, digital imaging and 3D modelling.\nA Micro-CT scan at the Natural History Museum in London provided amazing new insights. \u00a9 The Trustees of the Natural History Museum.\nFortunately, progress was made in 2009 when the skull went to the Natural History Museum for a Micro-CT scan. This type of non-invasive scan allowed the research team to see the interior of the skull, and digitally remove the layers of plaster and soil. The detailed imaging revealed some surprising facts about this individual\u2019s life.\nThe team found out that the skull belonged to a man who was over 40 years old when he died. He had broken teeth that were badly decayed, and abscesses that must have caused him pain. His nose had also been broken, but this injury had healed before he died. The most striking feature found from the Micro-CT scan was the man\u2019s head shape \u2013 varying thicknesses of bone indicated his head was tightly bound as an infant, permanently changing its shape.\nStudies of the scan results gave Curator Alexandra Fletcher details about how this person may have lived \u2013 his\u00a0health, diet, and religious practices. But the face of this person that had been so carefully modeled in plaster over 9,500 years ago remained unknown.\nThe 3D printed skull used to start facial reconstruction (left).

From this starting point, a lower jaw, created by copying other examples of a similar size and date, was added to the model.

After the British Museum Act gained royal assent in June 1753, it officially became the first national public museum in the world. It boasted a collection featuring:\n1,125 \u2018things relating to the customs of ancient times\u2019\n5,447 insects\na herbarium (that\u2019s a collection of dried plants)\n23,000 coins and medals\n50,000 books, prints and manuscripts\nLeft: Sir Hans Sloane\u2019s specimen tray. \u00a9 Natural History Museum. Centre: The Sloane astrolabe (an astronomical instrument). Right: a selection of shoes collected by Sloane.\nAs you can imagine, this took up a lot of space \u2013 so where would this cabinet of curiosities be displayed?\nFrom the beginning, the Museum was run by a board of trustees, who appointed a Principal Librarian to conduct the day-to-day running of the institution (now known as the Director). After rejecting Buckingham House (later the site of Buckingham Palace) on the grounds of cost and the unsuitability of its location(!), they decided to purchase Montague House on Great Russell Street for \u00a320,000 (around \u00a32 million in today\u2019s money). On 15 January 1759, the converted stately home opened its doors for the first time, and the British Museum as a public attraction was born.\nSutton Nicholls (fl. 1689\u20131729), Montague House. Etching and engraving, 1728.\nThe Museum hasn\u2019t always celebrated 15 January. A headline in the New York Times of January 1959 stated flatly (and perhaps with some disdain) that \u2018LONDON IGNORES AN ANNIVERSARY\u2019. Conversely, in 2014 the Museum featured in a Google Doodle in the UK for the 255th anniversary.\u00a0In 2017, we\u2019re launching this new blog \u2013 a hub for all sorts of digital content \u2013 where you can explore the stories of the Museum, from objects and the people who made them, to the Museum\u2019s own history, and the people who work here.\nHartwig Fischer, Director of the Museum today, explains a bit about the Museum \u2013 past, present and future \u2013 in this short video.\nSir Richard Lambert, current Chair of the Trustees of the British Museum, has said that when you become a trustee, you are reminded that you are responsible for holding in trust for the nation and the world a collection unlike any other. Most of the beneficiaries of this trust are yet to be born. The Museum thus has a uniquely long-term view about things. As such, this blog is part of an ongoing story \u2013 a new chapter, if you will.

Etching and engraving, 1728.\nThe British Museum is the world\u2019s oldest national public museum. Founded in 1753, it opened its doors in 1759, 17 years before the Declaration of Independence. It was free to all \u2018studious and curious persons\u2019, and it\u2019s still free today (but a few other things have changed).\n2.\u00a0The Museum had its own tube station for over 30 years\nMIND THE GAP! That\u2019s the gap between when there was a British Museum tube station and now. The photos above (courtesy of London Transport Museum) show the entrance to the Museum\u2019s underground station in 1921, some gentlemen waiting on the platform in 1903 (with some fabulous hats!) and its construction in 1898. The station opened in 1900, but was closed in September 1933 when the new Holborn station opened, less than 100 yards away.\n3. The Museum gate was\u00a0once guarded by a cat named Mike\nNo, not an elaborate April Fool. Many cats have lived at the Museum over the years. Perhaps the most famous was Mike, who guarded the main gate between 1909 and 1929. When he died, his obituary appeared in the Evening Standard and TIME magazine. The picture above shows\u00a0Mike in action.\n4.\u00a0London\u2019s landmarks could have been very different indeed\nThe British Museum was founded in 1753 when Sir Hans Sloane left his collection to the nation. But\u00a0before the Museum could open to the public, a suitable site needed to be purchased. One of the locations considered was a place called Buckingham House, which was later rebuilt as Buckingham Palace! But the Trustees agreed instead to move into Montague House, the site of the current Museum, and the rest is history! Or should that be geography?\n5.\u00a0The British Museum got so big it had to create two other national institutions to cope\nLeft: a mastodon skeleton on display, before the move to South Kensington. Right: the Round Reading Room, home of the British Library until 1997.\nSir Hans Sloane had collected a vast number of natural history specimens, and these were part of the Museum\u2019s collection for over a hundred years. In the 1880s, with space in Bloomsbury at a premium, it was agreed that these collections should move to a new site in South Kensington. London\u2019s\u00a0Natural History Museum\u00a0was still officially known as the British Museum (Natural History) until 1992, despite being legally separate since 1963! Similarly, the founding collection contained a huge number of manuscripts and books. The collection continued to grow and grow, until the\u00a0British Library\u00a0became a separate institution in 1973. Even then, it remained in the Bloomsbury site until 1997 when it\u00a0moved to the new building on Euston Road.\n6. The Museum was one of the first buildings to use electric lighting\nUntil the late 19th century the Museum was lit by natural daylight. Candles, oil lamps and gas lamps were not used in the galleries for fear of fire, and so\u00a0the Museum was often forced to close early due to poor light in winter or during a London fog. As such, the Museum became\u00a0one of the first public buildings in London to install electric lighting. In 1879 experimental electric lighting was provided in the Front Hall, the Reading Room and in the Forecourt. Although this early lighting system was unreliable, the Reading Room was able to stay open until 19.00 during the winter. Within 10 years an improved system had been extended to most of the public areas.\nThe engraving above was first published in the\u00a0Illustrated London News, February 1890.\n7. The Museum\u2019s collection was evacuated during the Second World War\nPlanning for the evacuation of the British Museum\u2019s treasures began in\u00a01933 \u2013 a surprisingly early date, although\u00a0many had begun to realise the dangers ahead. In 1938, the Museum and the National Library of Wales started work on a bombproof tunnel at Aberystwyth, and on Wednesday 23 August 1939, the Home Office gave orders to begin the evacuation. Heavy sculptures that could not make the journey were housed in the Aldwych Tube tunnel. You can find out more about the evacuation and its aftermath in these podcast episodes.\nNot everything was saved, however, and the Museum was struck by a number of incendiaries between September 1940 and May 1941. An air raid on 10 May 1941 resulted in the loss of some 250,000 books, the water from the fire hoses ruining most of those that survived the flames.\n8. The Museum has been\u00a0a popular film set\nWith 15 films to its name, the British Museum has a recognisable role in the movie world. The cameras\u00a0first arrived\u00a0in 1921 for\u00a0The Wakefield Cause, and were here again in 1973 for Hollywood classic,\u00a0Day of the Jackal.\u00a0In 1929, Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s\u00a0Blackmail was shot in the Museum,\u00a0becoming one of the first movies to feature the\u00a0Sch\u00fcfftan process \u2013 a special effect that uses mirrors to make it appear that the actors are on a vast set. You can see it in action in the clip below.\nYounger readers\u00a0might remember its appearance in Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\u00a0(2014). Sian Toogood was broadcast manager on the film: \u2018The limitations of what is possible within the British Museum meant that Fox only filmed\u00a0here for three nights, from the moment the gates closed to the public to 07.00 the next day. They had 200 crew on site, a 40-tonne crane, helium balloon lights so large they couldn\u2019t fit through the front door when inflated, and a myriad of other lights, cameras and stands. A\u00a0visual effects crew also 3D-scanned key spaces and dozens of objects to populate the film. Then there were the horses (outside) and the monkeys (inside).\u2019\nEach year around 50 film crews come to film everything from documentaries to music videos, so\u00a0Night at the Museum\u00a0won\u2019t be the last time we see the Museum on the silver screen.\n9. The British Museum is the largest indoor space on Google Street View\nIn November 2015 the Museum broke a modern record. Mapped out and presented digitally, the Museum\u00a0became the largest indoor space on Google Street View. You can explore it at your leisure\u00a0from the comfort of your own home (or the discomfort of the bus, or anywhere really), plus there are stories of thousands of highlight objects at the Google Cultural Institute.\n10. The railings aren\u2019t black, they\u2019re\u2026\nThe railings on Great Russell Street.\n\u2026any guesses? They\u2019re actually painted a colour called \u2018invisible green\u2019, used on many historic railings throughout London.\n11. The Museum once had a \u2018Cabinet of Obscene Objects\u2019\nOthers have called it the British Museum\u2019s \u2018porn room\u2019, but the title it was originally given is a little more salubrious: the\u00a0Secretum. Opened in 1865, following the publication of\u00a0the Obscene Publications Act (1857), the Secretum contained around 200 objects, labelled (possibly with the curator\u2019s tongue firmly in cheek?) as \u2018abominable monuments to human licentiousness\u2019. Anyone who wanted to get in for an afternoon of\nfun and games\nserious study required a special permit. Strictly for gentlemen only, one needed to demonstrate \u2018mature years and sound morals\u2019 in order to qualify. Details on how this was decided have not been recorded\u2026\nThe obvious questions for many people reading this will be, \u2018where is it now and how do I apply for a permit?\u2019 Alas, the Secretum is no more, but don\u2019t despair, as the objects are now dispersed throughout the Museum. As well as many of them being proudly on display today, you can still view some of the Secretum\u2019s contents in the most obvious place: the internet. We don\u2019t even check if you\u2019re of mature years and sound morals anymore, so anyone can check out things like\u00a0this satyr and goat, this Indian temple frieze carved with human figures engaged in a variety of sexual acts or this lamp featuring a naked woman sitting on a huge human phallus on the back of a crocodile. As you do.\n12. A hundred years ago you had to be a cross between Wikipedia and Google to work here\nExamination from 1912 for prospective employees.\nBack in 1912, staff at the British Museum had to sit a written entrance exam, as staff were part of the Civil Service. However, if you wanted to work in, say, Prints and Drawings, you had to answer additional questions like \u2018What was the relationship between the art of the goldsmith and that of the engraver, in Germany, during the 16th century?\u2019 and \u2018What do you know of the Iconography of Anthony Van Dyck?\u2019 To work in Coins and Medals, tasks included \u2018Give a brief account, with periods and types, of the coins of one of the following cities:\u2013\u00a0Nola, Poseidonia, Terina\u2019 and \u2018Trace in the coinage of South Italy the influence exerted by either the kings of Epirus or Hannibal.\u2019\u00a0We haven\u2019t asked the current curators if they can answer these, but they\u2019d probably give it a good go. Or say \u2018not my period\u2019\u2026\n13. Banksy had an unofficial exhibit at the Museum\nIn May 2005, world-famous street artist Banksy snuck a rock depicting a caveman with a shopping trolley into the British Museum. It stayed there for two days before anyone noticed it. He even added his own sign, saying the cave painting showed, \u2018early man venturing towards the out-of-town hunting grounds\u2019. It has since disappeared, and nobody\u2019s sure where it is today!\n14. A British Museum snail holds the record for longest suspended animation\nYep, you read that correctly. Of all the things in the British Museum that could come back to life, the world record for the longest period spent \u2018dead\u2019 before reanimation goes to a humble snail. Donated in 1846 (so when the natural history collection was still in Bloomsbury), the snail belonged to a collection put together in Egypt and Greece. They were stuck onto cardboard for display, and remained there for four years until the zoologist William Baird noticed that one of them had started\u00a0producing a strange mucus-like membrane in an apparent attempt to stop itself drying out. The snail was quickly rescued from its papery captivity and rehoused with a living partner, where it lived until its (actual) death in 1852.\n15. Possibly the world\u2019s oldest customer complaint is on display\nThis Mesopotamian tablet was written by a chap called Nanni nearly 4,000 years ago, clearly upset with the customer service he received from his copper merchant, Ea-Nasir. He writes:\nWhen you came, you said to me as follows: \u2018I will give Gimil-Sin (when he comes) fine quality copper ingots.\u2019 You left then but you did not do what you promised me. You put ingots that were not good before my messenger (Sit-Sin) and said: \u2018If you want to take them, take them; if you do not want to take them, go away!\u2019 What do you take me for, that you treat somebody like me with such contempt\u2026 Take cognizance that (from now on) I will not accept here any copper from you that is not of fine quality. I shall (from now on) select and take the ingots individually in my own yard, and I shall exercise against you my right of rejection because you have treated me with contempt.\nIt\u2019s written in cuneiform, a type of writing that means \u2018wedge-shaped\u2019 as it was created by impressing a stylus into clay, and then firing it so it hardened. It required a bit more effort than an angry comment on a blog\u2026\n16. The Museum is still acquiring\nLeft: The Lampedusa Cross acquired in 2015. Right: detail of the alabaster Virgin and Child, made in the Midlands, c. 1360s.\nIt\u2019s easy to assume that museums only house ancient\u00a0objects, but in fact acquisitions (of ancient and modern objects) continue to be made all the time. A poignant modern\u00a0acquisition in 2015 was a Lampedusa Cross, donated by an Italian carpenter who made it with pieces of wood from the wreckage of boats used by refugees trying to reach Europe. For something a little older, in December 2016, the Museum acquired a beautiful medieval alabaster of the Virgin and Child, made in the Midlands in the 1360s.\n17. The Japanese Galleries house a replica of a traditional tea house\u2026\nTwice a month, the Urasenke Foundation hold a Japanese tea ceremony. It\u2019s free to watch, so keep an eye out\u00a0for timings if you want to experience something a bit unusual in the centre of London.\n18. \u2026and the Korea Gallery contains a full-size replica of a scholar\u2019s study, known as a sarangbang.\nThe sarangbang (scholar\u2019s study) in Room 67.\nThe reconstruction of a traditional Korean\u00a0scholar\u2019s study was built by contemporary Korean master craftsmen in the summer of 2000. It displays traditional Korean architecture. Please try not to set off the alarm when you look at it!\n19. The British Museum is the UK\u2019s most popular attraction\nWith around 6.5\u00a0million annual visitors, the British Museum is\u00a0the UK\u2019s most visited attraction, more popular than the Tate, the National Gallery and even Blackpool Pleasure Beach!\n20. The Museum loans more objects than any other institution in the world\nAs a museum of the world, for the world, it\u2019s vitally important that the objects in the collection are shared with as many people as possible. In 2015/16 over 5,000 objects were sent across the globe on loan, making us the most sharing museum on the planet.\n21. The most searched-for things on our website are not the opening hours\nTorii Kiyonaga (1752\u20131815), detail of\u00a0Sode No Maki (Handscroll for the Sleeve). Painted handscroll, \u00a0c. 1785.\nIn fact, they are \u2018Egypt\u2019 (53,000 annual searches), which isn\u2019t too surprising given the amount of mummies residing at the British Museum, and \u2018shunga\u2018. Perhaps this is equally unsurprising as \u2018shunga\u2019 is an explicit and beautifully detailed Japanese erotic art form, and was the subject of a special exhibition in 2014. The 40,000 annual\u00a0searches for shunga seem to prove that there are plenty of Nipponophiles out there (that\u2019s \u2018lovers of Japan or Japanese culture\u2019, for those of you sniggering at the back).\n22. The Museum\u2019s pediment depicts \u2018the Progress of Civilisation\u2019\nThe triangular thing over the columns of the Main entrance is an architectural feature known as a pediment. It shows the development of \u2018mankind\u2019 in eight stages \u2013 quite an old-fashioned idea now, but then it was designed and built in the 1850s. As you look at it, the left hand side shows the creation of man as he emerges from a rock as an ignorant being. He meets the next character, the Angel of Enlightenment who is holding the Lamp of Knowledge. From the lamp,\u00a0man learns basic skills such as cultivating land and taming animals.\nThe next step in the progress of civilisation is for man to expand his knowledge and understanding. The following\u00a0eight figures represent the subjects he must learn to do this. From left to right they are: architecture and sculpture, painting and science, geometry and\u00a0drama, and music and poetry. The final human figure, on the right, represents \u2018educated man\u2019. Having expanded his knowledge,\u00a0man can now dominate the world around him.\nThe pediment over the Main entrance and its original design by Sir Richard Westmacott.\nThe original pediment had a Wedgwood blue background and the statues were all painted white.\n23. The Museum has an extremely rare North Korean collection\nSong Chan-yong (b. 1930), The Steelworker. Oil on canvas, c. 1990\u20131999.\nIn 2001 and 2002 colleagues from the British Museum and the British Library visited the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (North Korea). Jane Portal, then the curator of the Korean collections (and now the Museum\u2019s Keeper of Asia) built one of the largest collections of works of art from North Korea in a western museum. On her first trip she collected woodblock prints, ink paintings, oil paintings, posters, calligraphy, ceramics, lacquer and commemorative coins. On her second visit she collected mostly prints and posters. Thanks to this initiative the Museum now has about 80 objects from North Korea.\n24. The window cleaning bills aren\u2019t small\nThe Great Court at the British Museum is the largest covered square in Europe, so the roof needs to be pretty big.

The most popular exhibition at the British Museum was\u00a0in 1972\nThose over 50s with good memories may well remember the Tutankhamun-mania that accompanied the Museum\u2019s most popular exhibition, way back in 1972. With health and safety not what it is today, around 1.6 million people filed through the doors to see the treasures of the world\u2019s most famous Egyptian king.\nThe queue outside the Museum for the 1972 exhibition Treasures of Tutankhamun.\nOpened on 30 March 1972 by HM Queen Elizabeth II, the exhibition coincided with the 50th anniversary of the discovery of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb. In total, 50 objects were exhibited in Treasures of Tutankhamun, one for every year since the discovery.\u00a0The star object was the famous gold death mask.\nLeft: Treasures of Tutankhamun poster.

There\u2019s been a postcard shop in the Museum for over a hundred years!\nThe postcard stall in 1929, in the entrance hall.\nOn 14\u00a0October 1911, the Trustees gave the Director permission to prepare a scheme for the sale of postcards in the Museum. By 10 February 1912, the Director had made proposals for contracts for the supply of picture postcards to be sold in the Museum and it was agreed that there would be three saleswomen on the stall. In April 1912, financial provision for a counter for the sale of photographs and postcards\u00a0had been approved and this was to be the first Museum shop. However, not everyone was happy to see the opening of the postcard stall. In 1912, a notice appeared in the literary magazine \u2018The Athenaeum\u2019 submitted by \u2018An Old Reader\u2019. They described the stall as \u2018large and obtrusive\u2026\u00a0surrounded by a chattering throng of young schoolgirls.\u2019\u00a0This image shows the postcard stall, located in the entrance hall, in 1929.

It reflects the diversity of the city, its multi-cultural identity. It has also been a way of people learning about the Oxford Hindu Temple Project and how important Ganesha is to us. To me personally, Ganesha means the beginning of everything. So before I start anything, or embark on anything or do anything, my first port of call.\nKiran: For many students who come to Oxford \u2013 many who come from abroad \u2013 this is a new step in their lives, which makes Ganesha very important for them.\nKanta: Oxford is a university town\u2026and there are so many obstacles in the way of students: writing essays, time keeping, going out, whatever it is. Ganesha is the lord of success and gets rid of all obstacles in your way. But he is also worshipped as the god of education, wisdom and wealth, and what better place than Oxford for all these things to come together.\nAntonia: How did you select the objects that you have loaned the Museum of Oxford to accompany the Ganesha statue? Could you tell us about a few of them?\nKanta: When you welcome Ganesha into your home, you start at your doorway, laying out rangolis with colourful patterns. That\u2019s why we made this special pair of rangolis to welcome Ganesha to the Museum of Oxford.\nThe word rangolis derives from the Sanskrit word rangavali: \u2018rang\u2019 is colour and \u2018vali\u2019 is the pattern. Making rangolis is an ancient art and a sign of celebration, and central to any religious ritual including weddings and parties.\nKanta: The second object I chose for the display is from my own home and represents the next step in welcoming Ganesha to your home through the door: it is a toran (from the Sanskrit word\u00a0torana), or door hanging. When you enter your home through the toran, you place flowers, turmeric, palm leaves and coconut near where Ganesha is going to sit in your shrine.\nFinally on your shrine, you have the puja thali \u2013 or prayer tray. The prayer offering (thali) laid out on the tray normally includes flowers, fruit, water, camphor, food and a monetary offering.\nGyan: Another important object in welcoming Ganesha is a tray full of Indian sweet meats so we put this in front of the statue at the launch. Having prayed to Ganesha, the sweet meats are afterwards consumed by the devotees and at the Museum of Oxford exhibition launch, we shared them with the visitors.\nOne of the objects accompanying the Ganesha on display in the Museum of Oxford gallery. (Photo: (c) Damien Haliwell )\nAntonia: How is the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi celebrated in Oxford?\nGyan: If we had a temple in Oxford, we would celebrate through a 10-day festival of prayers and ceremonies to a statue of Ganesha residing in the temple. This would culminate on the final day with the statue needing to be cleaned. Usually what you would do in India is to take him to the nearest river and give him a good wash and bring him back and re-establish him in the temple.\nAntonia: How did you welcome Ganesha to Oxford on the day of the exhibition opening?\nKiran: For me, it was an exciting day with lots of preparations going on in the gallery, and we welcomed Ganesh the way they still do in India: with special food and many people singing, everyone joining in \u2013 the visitors of the Museum were clapping and some tried to sing with us as well.\nWe decorated and cleaned the gallery and put up new garlands, fresh flowers, coconut, pine leaves, red colour turmeric and Indian sweets like ladoos.\nKanta: It was a day for everyone to be together and I think it worked really well.\nGyan: It was also wonderful to have the performance of a traditional invocatory dance dedicated to Lord Ganesha by trained Indian Classical dancer, Shahila Gokul. Talking to people afterwards, they all said it was a perfect way of depicting Ganesha and devotion to Ganesha.\nAntonia: What were the important considerations the Museum needed to take into account when displaying Ganesha?\nKanta: I think that the British Museum and the Museum of Oxford brought Ganesha here with a lot of respect: there was a clean place in the gallery, and a central place with enough space, rather than him being hidden away in the corner.\nGyan: The main thing about displaying a deity in a museum is that while some people come to look at it as an artefact from antiquity, there are also people who come to look at it as a form to which they show their devotion. So it is important for a museum to allow some space around the statue rather than crowding him with objects that are totally unrelated. That way, people can sit or stand there in silence, for their one-to-one prayers with the deity. I think that in the Museum of Oxford space, this was done very well.\nKanta: And the statue is approachable, you can go right up to it.\nKiran: I think it\u2019s very unique that the Museum of Oxford asked local people to provide loans to accompany the statue of Ganesha, and to have the veil on the plinth because it shows what the statue was originally meant to be used for. When I arrived here in Oxford for the first time and visited another museum, I saw a statue of Ganesha behind glass and I thought: this is supposed to be looked at as a god, and it\u2019s now just a piece of the museum. I loved it that in the Museum of Oxford this wasn\u2019t the case. The exhibition launch was so lively and people were able to see Ganesha being welcomed to the space in the way that he would have been traditionally beyond the Museum.\nBecause we don\u2019t have a temple in Oxford, in the week before the festival, we hold our usual prayer session and carry out a 20-minute puja or prayer of devotion to a little statue of Ganesha. We then wash him, feed him and so on, and then we say mantras.\nKanta: Ganesh Chaturthi is the birthday of Ganesha and many people celebrate at home with a small clay Ganesha. Having welcomed him and worshipped him, you immerse him in a bucket of water outside. This is a way of saying \u2018beginning of the new\u2019. This is something we do in our homes in Oxford.\nGanesha on display in the Museum of Oxford gallery.

Much of the detail of this scene is illegible with the naked eye.\nUsing highly penetrative infrared radiation, infrared-reflected (IRR) images were collected. These images showed that the under drawings and outlines were made with an infrared opaque carbon-based pigment, such as soot or carbon black. The greater contrast between this and infrared transparent materials made possible by this technique allows details of the scenes, such as the one with the mummy and jars (see above), to be more easily seen. The images reveal more sharply defined and interpretable hieroglyphs, a clearer view of the decorative details and previously unseen features of the mummy\u2019s face and wrappings, as well as a clearer view of the canopic jars, which allowed the gods they represent to be identified.\nA visible-induced infrared luminescence (VIL) image of the mummy and jars scene found on the lid of the outer coffin of Nestawedjat (EA22813A). The pigment Egyptian blue appears bright white in these images.\nThe visible-induced infrared (VIL) imaging technique is used to identify and locate the presence of the pigment Egyptian blue, which appears bright white in these images\u00a0 (see above). Egyptian blue is produced by heating together quartz sand, a copper compound, calcium carbonate, and a small amount of an alkali (ash or natron) at temperatures ranging between 800\u00b0C and 1,000\u00b0C. It can then be ground to a fine powder, mixed with binder and painted onto a surface. Although some areas of Egyptian blue pigment are evident with the naked eye, the VIL image of the mummy and jars scene shows that the distribution of blue pigment is more widespread than at first observed and that much of the detail which now appears dark would have originally been bright blue.\nUsing all the information gathered from the multispectral imaging, along with the analysis of microsamples taken from the coffin a colour reconstruction of the mummy and jars scene has been created. The illustration reveals the range of colours that would have been used to decorate the coffin \u2013 bringing back to life what has been hidden for millennia.\nA colour reconstruction by illustrator Claire Thorne of the mummy and jars scene found on the outer coffin of Nestawedjat (EA22813,a), based on the information provided by multispectral imaging and analysis.\nNicola Newman (right) and scientist Joanne Dyer (left)"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-british-museum-membercast-south-africa/", "category": "Podcasts", "title": "The British Museum Membercast: South Africa", "author": "British Museum and Andrew Shore", "timestamp": "2016-12-14 00:00:00", "text": "In our first episode, Iszi sneaks into the back of the lecture theatre to hear curators John Giblin and Chris Spring present an overview of the special exhibition South Africa: the art of a nation at the exclusive Members\u2019 lecture earlier this year.

Head-rest. 19th-century, Somali, British Museum Af1933,1114.16.\nExploring the Somali collection in the Museum\u2019s store\nThe first London based Object Journeys project in 2015/16 aimed to explore the Somali collections at the British Museum. They worked\u00a0with 10 young adults from the London Somali community to explore the Museum\u2019s Somali objects, many of which are not on display, in order to uncover new knowledge and tell new stories at the Museum. From exploring and researching the objects in the Museum\u2019s stores and archives to the brainstorming of potential display case themes, to setting up social media accounts and identifying wider members of the Somali community to get involved, the group worked closely with staff to conceptualise and develop their display at every stage.\nExploring the conservation laboratories in the WCEC at the British Museum.\nCollaboration being key, here\u2019s what some of the Object Journey participants had to say about the project:\nHuda Haid: opportunities to shed light on Somali culture\nSomali culture and tradition are areas most people don\u2019t know very much about. To some, it may even be unheard of. Taking part in the project was an opportunity to promote and showcase these very aspects of Somalia that the public are otherwise unfamiliar with, by using the British Museum\u2019s collection of Somali objects. In my view, there is no better way to achieve this than through this medium as each individual object will tell a unique story and represent different aspects of Somali life, culture, and tradition. I also admired the fact that the Museum sought to create a display of Somali objects by involving young Somalis like myself to have a say and have a first-hand interaction with the Museum and its collection.\nWith this in mind, I hope that the project creates a platform for Somali communities or any community for that matter to connect and interact with the Museum in a way it hasn\u2019t done before. Moreover, I hope that the project creates a display that\u2019s unique and is different from displays the Museum has done before, in that it is perhaps more interactive and engaging to visitors through the use of more creative and inventive methods of display. My upmost ambition is to shed light on Somalia\u2019s vibrant and fascinating culture.\nOriginal object registration catalogue of Somali objects in the Africa, Oceania and Americas collection\nLadan Dire: the pulling power of Somali Object Journeys\nThe Object Journeys project attracted my attention in that it is getting a community to curate an exhibition concerning their culture and their history and this, to me, seems like a \u2018different take\u2019 for an institution like the British Museum. The British Museum, as a national institution, is rooted in a history of colonialism and its objects, many collected during this time represent many regions, countries and cultures. It was this link to colonialism that led to my interest in exploring the Somali collection at the Museum and seeing what stories and histories could be revealed and uncovered through objects collected or taken during Somalia\u2019s colonial past\nI feel that taking part in the Object Journeys project can present a different story. I don\u2019t believe that an object alone can tell the story of Somali culture, as cultures are dynamic and a collection of objects can only reveal so much. However, the process of curating with groups like ours can challenge the narrative of colonialism often surrounding large museums like the British Museum. Firstly, through detailing the objects in a way that demonstrates how the objects originally came into the hands of the British Museum, I feel we can explore the institutions\u2019 collecting past in a frank manner. Secondly, the involvement of sections of the British Somali Community in the process can strengthen the exhibition in bringing our knowledge of the objects and stories behind them directly to the Museum and its visitors.\nThe Somali Object Journeys project culminated with a display at The British Museum during the summer and autumn of 2016 and an accompanying\u00a0 programme of events."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/maggi-hambling-on-life-death-and-drawing/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Maggi Hambling on life, death and drawing", "author": "British Museum and Andrew Shore", "timestamp": "2016-12-05 00:00:00", "text": "Although mainly known for her paintings and sculpture, drawing is at the heart of Hambling\u2019s artistic practice.

For this purpose it is best to introduce water very slowly, which allows the adhesive to gradually swell and soften without making the paper too wet. We have a choice of conservation-grade powders that will absorb and hold water in a gel or thick liquid, which we apply as a \u2018poultice\u2019. We sometimes use a fabric that holds moisture, such as a Microfibre cloth or capillary matting combined with a barrier material such as Gore-TexR which controls the rate of humidification.\nHaving settled on using a poultice, we removed the majority of the linen backing using this method. Some areas proved more difficult than others \u2013 perhaps where the paper was more deteriorated or thinner, or where the paste had been applied more thickly, or maybe different batches of paste were used. Akin to Goldilocks and her porridge, the poultice had to be left on the linen backing for just the right period of time: too short and some original paper fibres might be accidentally removed, too long and the paper would get soft and be at risk of damage. The goalposts changed as we moved across the print because of the variable topography but, as a reward for our patience, we got to know the print and its little quirks like a best friend. Getting up close and intimate with the print and observing the different styles of chamfering, pasting etc. allowed us to discover what a team effort it must have been to assemble and back it originally.\nPeeling off the linen backing\nWe too had to work as a team and during this period we were joined by students who observed the treatments and, for a few days of backing removal, by a fellow paper conservator Harry Metcalf, from the City Museum and Art Gallery, Bristol.\nConservators Caroline Barry and Harry Metcalf: hard at work\nIn order to reach the centre of the print, we started taking the individual sheets apart as soon as enough of the backing was removed to allow us to do so.\nUnexpectedly, the joins had been thinned down in the past to the point where only a fragile layer of paper fibres remained, and it proved the greatest challenge of the project thus far to take the printed sheets apart safely. It required all our skill and ingenuity, including sourcing tools used in dentistry and even purchasing antique manicure sets on eBay and treating this like an exercise in micro-surgery. After weeks of painstaking labour the print has been taken apart into its original 38 sheets.\nWe also experimented with agarose gel strips (agarose is usually extracted from seaweed) to humidify the joins but the poultice applied on top of the linen, along the joints proved to be the most successful method. Most of the linen backing we removed was kept for possible future analysis and experimentation.\nSo far we have discovered that pieces of old prints were used to infill historical losses; there was also a notation made on the verso in red chalk; and the various watermarks on the different sheets are a lot more visible without the lining in place. Now that every sheet is easily accessible, it is apparent how creased and distorted some of the sheets are and we have an opportunity to note historical repairs of missing areas, other damage as well as record the watermarks in detail. Recording this detailed examination is currently underway.\nDiscovery of historical repairs using old print fragments (ambient light on the left, transmitted light on the right)\nDiscovery of historical repairs using old print fragments (ambient light on the left, transmitted light on the right)\nUpper left: discovery of historical repairs using old print fragments under ambient light.

Above: historical notation on verso of print in red chalk\nWatermark visible in transmitted light after the backing has been removed\nSome of the infill paper at the edges proved very deteriorated and brittle and the adhesive tested acidic, putting the print at risk of further deterioration and confirming that it was high time to carry out conservation and perhaps something to keep in mind for when we might be secretly grumbling to ourselves \u2018whose crazy idea was it to take this thing apart?\u2019 when the time comes to fit all those sheets back together\u2026. But before this happens, and after we have completed the documentation, we shall be carrying out treatments to reduce the old adhesive left on the back of the sheets as well as reduce the acidity, about which we will post an update on this blog in the near future."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/mind-your-money-money-matters/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Mind your money: money matters", "author": "Heidi Hinder, Artist and Designer", "timestamp": "2016-03-11 00:00:00", "text": "Money.

The subject of so many songs and clich\u00e9s, money dominates and determines our life experience, even our identity.\nCoin design by New Horizon Youth Centre workshop participant. (Photo: Jonathan Rowley)\nThis much is obvious to those who attend the New Horizon Youth Centre, a London-based charity that supports homeless and at risk young people, and aims to help them create a more positive future for themselves. Part of New Horizon\u2019s Social Enterprise Project offers young people the chance to improve on essential life skills, such as communication and confidence, by providing workshops in partnership with organisations like the British Museum, and with artists like myself.\nSo this was how a group of bright young people from New Horizon and I came to be gathered around a table in the British Museum, talking about money, with the Citi Money Gallery Education Manager, Mieka Harris, and the Curator of the Citi Money Gallery, Ben Alsop as part of the Citi Money Gallery Education Programme.\nOur discussions were sparked off by some intriguing handling objects, selected by the curator from the Museum\u2019s extensive collection of coins and currencies. As we lifted the lid on boxes of enigmatic artifacts, money started to appear in all sorts of unexpected guises, unusual materials, shapes and sizes. Large heavy crosses of copper weighed alongside tiny slivers of silver, and exotic shells rolled out next to green knives and pieces of fine silk cloth. The diversity of the designs was remarkable, highlighted by these examples of the different material forms that money has adopted throughout history and across the world. In each of these tokens, we glimpsed something of the time and culture that had originally issued them for commercial exchange.\nKatanga Cross, formerly used as currency in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Made by Kuba in Katanga. H. 19 cm. British Museum Af1993,02.151\nCowrie shells were historically traded as money. These were produced in West Africa. British Museum SSB,155.5\nWhile no one in our group could imagine carrying shells in their wallet or swapping copper crosses for goods and services around London, the idea of money as a versatile designed object appealed to everyone. We took a closer look at our own contemporary currency, observing the intricate detail that ensures the designs are as secure as they are symbolic, and a powerful representation of our national identity.\nA montage of macro images showing the detailed design of bank notes. (Photo: Jonathan Rowley)\nMacro image of a five pence coin. (Photo: Jonathan Rowley)\nSecurity and identity became relevant themes as one of the participants described how she had to scan her fingerprint to pay for food on account at her college canteen. This biometric payment method had been installed for convenience and safety, so that students would no longer need to carry cash. A contentious debate then ensued, as the New Horizon group questioned the control of our personal data, the anonymity of cash and the rise of cryptocurrencies, such as BitCoin. Was technology improving security, or just compromising our privacy?\nI shared an example from my own work, which illustrates one instance where biometric transfers could arguably improve on current methods of economic exchange.\nFinancial Growth, bacteria on coin, by Heidi Hinder, 2013. (Photo: Jonathan Rowley)\nThis image, from a series of petri dish experiments called Financial Growth, reveals the bacteria present on coins and suggests that each time we make a cash transaction, we are exchanging more than just the monetary value and some tangible tokens. Hard currency could become a point of contagion.\nAlternatively, I suggested to the group that technology has the potential to make money more personal, in a sociable and emotional way. Introducing my project called Money No Object, I demonstrated how a series of wearable technology prototypes could use social gestures as a method of making a payment or donating to charity. With technology tags embedded in gloves, rings, badges and shoes, the Money No Object wearables enable value to be transferred at the point of physical contact, by shaking hands, giving a high-five, hugging or even by tap-dancing on a giant coin with a pair of \u2018Tap & Pay\u2019 shoes.\nA participant from the New Horizon Youth Centre tries out some of the Money No Object prototypes with the \u2018High-Five & Pay\u2019 gloves (Photo: Ben Alsop)\nThe New Horizon group were keen to donate some fictional pounds by giving me some high-fives and watching their donations quickly add up on the corresponding info graphic \u2013 a live screen which records the total amount of donations in real time. The Money No Object project aims to encourage the frequency and level of charitable giving, by making the donation process sociable and entertaining. Judging by the grand total at the end of the high-five demo, the project achieved its purpose with this enthusiastic group!\nSo as we explored the increasing convergence of money, technology and identity, and recognised that money could incur a very personal exchange, I invited the group to express some of their ideas visually, by designing their own coins. What would they choose to represent if they were creating their own monetary tokens?\nCoin design ideas by workshop participants. (Photo: Mieka Harris)\nAfter sketching out some of their initial thoughts on paper, the group were given the chance to scribe these designs onto wax discs which would later be cast into bronze and displayed at the British Museum.\nCoin designs inscribed into wax, ready for casting into bronze. (Photo: Jonathan Rowley)\nFrom representations of surveillance and state control to symbols of infinity, freedom and love; from expressions of financial lack to being financially on track, the effects of money inscribed by the young people were insightful and revealing. Some coins humorously commented on the cost of living with the words \u2018arm\u2019 and \u2018leg\u2019 while other designs were abstract, like the very notion of money.\nExperimenting with these newly-introduced skills of carving and scribing into casting wax, the New Horizon participants deftly worked the material to produce these highly creative results.

Leonard Woolley. You can read more about Wooley\u2019s excavation and the project here.\nOne of my current tasks is to work on the metal objects.\nOne object in this group, a third millenium copper-alloy cauldron, discovered in the 1928\u20131929 excavation at Ur as part of a grave assemblage, has proved especially interesting\u2026\nIn the Middle East department in the British Museum, archaeological metal objects are kept in controlled environmental conditions to ensure that corrosion is limited. Ur metal objects are usually stable although many bear the effects of long-term burial in salty, and therefore corrosive, conditions. This cauldron is a prime example!\nCauldron. The rim is detached. The wooden supports across the interior were probably added at the same time that the rim was repaired.\u00a0British Museum\u00a01929,1017.625.\nInitially it was a pitiful sight, as the on-going effects of several thousand years of burial have taken their toll. The rim was detached and in fragments and the visible parts of the metal body appeared entirely mineralised, that is, entirely corroded. Soil lined\u00a0the interior in a thick layer and was clearly visible where corroded sections of the vessel wall had fallen away from the exterior. Over this soil layer, the interior of the cauldron and the underside of the exterior were\u00a0lined with strips of waxed calico (coarse cotton).\nCauldron interior, showing the waxed calico lining the vessel and the fibrous putty-like material used to repair the rim (now orange-brown in colour).\nThe waxed calico was applied during excavation as a means to protect the object and possibly also to preserve its shape during lifting and transport. A layer of melted paraffin wax was applied over all. In more recent years, probably the 1970s, an attempt was made to secure the rim: a light fibrous putty-like material, used in conservation from the late 1960s to 1980s, is found over much of the area where the rim would have joined the body.\nThe cauldron initially seemed so deteriorated that it could be of value only as an example of Woolley\u2019s excavation methods rather than\u00a0as an archaeological object.\nHowever, closer observation revealed that a large section of the rounded wall of the cauldron body appears to have survived intact, that is with only superficial corrosion apparent (the interior is hidden by the waxed calico).\u00a0 The detached rims also proved to be less deteriorated than on first view. The two handles and their fixings, including large square-headed rivets, are clearly visible and in some parts well-preserved.\nCauldron rim section showing the handle fittings and rivets.\nAlthough Woolley\u2019s account of the Ur excavations gives barely a page to metal vessels such as this, he created a detailed typology of metal vessel forms. The surviving elements of the cauldron allowed it to be securely identified as Woolley\u2019s Type 49, distinguished by its riveted handles, rounded profile and splayed rim.\nWoolley\u2019s vessel Type 49. \u00a0Woolley, C. L., Ur Excavations: The Royal Cemetery, 1934.\nThis information made it possible to identify a series of findspots (burials), eight in total, where this cauldron-type occurred. Of these, one in particular (PG 1422) includes a cauldron of dimensions that correspond very closely to those of the cauldron under discussion. Curator Sarah Collins, of the British Museum Middle East Department, noted that if the cauldron is from this grave, it probably dates to the end of the Akkadian period (2300 \u2013 2150 BC) or later.\nA drawing from one of Woolley\u2019s fieldwork notebooks of Grave PG 1422. The large cauldron found in this grave is depicted at the bottom left of the image.\nFurther information is provided by the illustration of this burial from Woolley\u2019s field notes.\u00a0 This shows a large cauldron on its side at the foot of the burial.\u00a0 The fact that the cauldron has what appear to be woven fibres preserved on one side could support the idea that it is the one from site PG 1422. \u00a0\u00a0Most Ur burials had a floor of matting. Usually the only surviving evidence of this is where it has been preserved on\u00a0metal surfaces. Features of this type are known as Mineral Preserved Organic remains (MPOs).\u00a0 This occurs when an organic substance, such as textile, leather, or natural or man-made fibre, is placed in contact with a metal surface over a prolonged period.\u00a0 Metallic compounds from a corroding object inhibit the decay of organic materials and can eventually replace the entire structure. In archaeology, this process has ensured the preservation of the exact form of textile and other materials which otherwise would have been entirely lost.\nThe woven fibres are obscured by paraffin wax, although still recognisable.\u00a0 Woolley observed that the pattern of the matting lining the burial was unusual and included a drawing of this in his field notes. Identifying how much of the mineral-preserved woven fibre survives, identifying whether it is matting, and whether it shows the pattern of the matting identified by Woolley are all questions to be explored.\nA drawing from one of Woolley\u2019s fieldwork notebooks of the matting that lined grave PG 1422.\nAlso of potential interest is a crust of sooty deposit that is readily visible on the exterior of the cauldron wall and around the rim. Similar dark material is found embedded in the soil on\u00a0the inner surface of the cauldron, where a section of soil has broken away from the metal surface. It is possible that this material could provide evidence of what the cauldron was used for. For example, traces of lipids (fats) could suggest that the vessel was used as a cooking pot\u00a0but to prove this it would be essential to find a sample untouched by Woolley\u2019s paraffin wax.\nMy aim is to stabilise the cauldron and secure it, as far as possible, for the future.\u00a0 Close on the heels of this, through investigative conservation, I\u2019d hope to extract information from the object, in the least intrusive manner, that will be of use in future research.\nThis process requires thought and care. For example, removing the obscuring layer of waxed calico and soil within the cauldron could lead to its complete collapse as it is in such a fragmented state. Further, as the object is also an example of Woolley\u2019s excavation practice, there is an argument for this material to be preserved (providing that it is not now causing damage to the object).\nFirst, the cauldron must be secured, supported and stabilised.\u00a0 Next, it should be X-radiographed to identify how much of the metal of the cauldron body survives and possibly also to help glean information about structure and technology.\u00a0 Further work, including analysis of the sooty deposits, and study of the mineral-preserved woven fibres, would all add to the body of data about the cauldron.\u00a0 Methods of removing wax to reveal the surface of the object and the woven fibres could be explored with the support of Organics conservation colleagues.\nHow much can be achieved within the bounds of the current project, beyond the essentials, remains to be seen, as there are many more objects to assess and treat, but certainly these observations on this cauldron will be documented and thoughts on future investigations outlined.\nSo, from what initially appeared an unpromising corroded mass, a range of possible investigations has evolved which could help reveal more about the technology, use and significance of this vessel, not to mention helping establish its identity within a particular assemblage.\u00a0 Although a humble object compared to the known treasures of Ur, it is potentially a small treasure house in itself of culturally significant information.\nTo conclude, Woolley\u2019s tantalising notes on burial PG 1422:\n\u2018This was the first grave which, on internal evidence, we could confidently assign to a period intermediate between the early cemetery and that of the Sargonid age:.. Even the Arab workmen recognised that it was in some way unlike any of the 1400 graves previously dug, and were greatly interested in it.\u00a0 Their interpretation of some of its characteristics is perhaps worth putting on record: the unusual richness of his personal ornaments meant that he was young as well as wealthy; the number of weapons in the grave and the great size of the spear-heads meant that he was a fighting man and a warrior of note; but when they saw the cauldron at the foot of the coffin, a cauldron very much larger than the norm, they agreed that he was the leader of a band of robbers or else the sheikh of a clan; for only one holding such a position and having numerous followers to feed would require so huge a cooking-pot\u2019 (C. L. Woolley, Ur Excavations: The Royal Cemetery, II, (1934), pp.186-187)."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/sharp-of-teeth-crocodiles-in-the-ancient-sahara/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "Sharp of teeth: crocodiles in the ancient Sahara", "author": "Jorge de Torres, Project Cataloguer, African Rock Art Image Project", "timestamp": "2016-02-16 00:00:00", "text": "For many people crocodiles represent the ultimate predator, a merciless killer which hides in the water to prey on whatever comes to drink water or to cross rivers. Probably the most well-known crocodile habitat is the Nile, where these animals dwell in great numbers and sometimes attack people. In ancient times, however, crocodiles were regarded as more complex than simply vicious carnivores, as the current Asahi Shimbun Display, Scanning Sobek: mummy of the crocodile god, in Room 3 demonstrates. Through the combination of CT scans and archaeological research, the display of this four-metre long crocodile introduces visitors to the beliefs of ancient Egyptians, to whom this mummy was an incarnation of the crocodile god Sobek. Although crocodiles were considered terrifying beings to be placated through offerings and gifts, they were also associated with the fertility of the river Nile and its annual flood, which was fundamental to the wellbeing of the country.\nMummified crocodile with hatchlings on display, alongside a 3D visualisation of the mummy created from the CT-scan data. (Photo: \u00a9 Trustees of the British Museum)\nIt is difficult to imagine crocodiles without an abundance of water, and therefore the Sahara Desert is one of the last places one would think of as a crocodile habitat. Astonishingly, even today there are several areas in the southern Sahara where small groups of crocodiles still endure the harsh conditions of semi-desert zones, and survive in caves, pockets of water and other permanent water sources. Although until the 20th century crocodiles were still found in some areas of Morocco and the Tassili n\u2019Ajjer massif in Algeria, nowadays northern African crocodiles are mostly found in Mauritania and Chad.\nView of the Archei Guelta, one of the places in Chad where crocodiles can still be found. (Photo: \u00a9 TARA / David Coulson 2013,2034.6424)\nThe situation was very different ten thousand years ago. At that moment the Sahara, now the largest non-polar desert on earth, was a savannah crossed by networks of rivers. Species such as hippopotamus, elephant and giraffe lived near the shores of mega lakes. Throughout the desert, archaeologists and palaeontologists have documented skeletons of crocodiles in areas as unlikely as Algeria, Libya and northern Mali, proving that crocodiles roamed in a greener Sahara thousands of years ago.\nAlthough most of the information about the presence of crocodiles in the Sahara derives from bones, there is another source of information to record the presence of these animals in the desert: the depictions of crocodiles in the Saharan rock art. The best known example is this striking engraving located in the Messak Setaffet, a stony plateau located in the south of Libya with numerous dry riverbeds running to the east into Murzuq erg. These riverbeds are home to some of the oldest rock art depictions in the Sahara, many of them representing animals long since disappeared from the region. Measuring more than two meters in length the crocodile depicted is accompanied by a hatchling and a cow engraved under one of its forelegs. The meticulous engraving technique, the size of the images and the carefully chosen boulder make this figure one of the most iconic rock art depictions in the Sahara.\nThe great crocodile of Tin-Habeter. Wadi Mathendous, Libya. 2013,2034.3106 (Photo: \u00a9 TARA / David Coulson)\nDetail of the hatchling that accompanies the crocodile. 2013,2034.3111 (Photo: \u00a9 TARA / David Coulson)\nThis is one of my favourite images of the African Rock Art Image Project, so when the project team investigated which rock art sites could be digitally recreated; the Messak crocodiles were the first to come to my mind. The results of this work provide an alternative view of some of the most remarkable features of these figures, and reflect the skill and dedication of the artist who used the boulder to enhance the shape of the animal. A month ago, this 3D model was printed (at a smaller scale) and now we have a small version of a 10,000-year-old engraving, a beautiful example of a world long vanished, but an important didactic tool, too. As a digital-only project, one of the challenges we face is to make people see our images as material expressions of the past, and 3D printing provides a link between the original piece and the contemporary public. Though impressive, the crocodile image isn\u2019t just a piece of art, it\u2019s also a cultural expression of Saharan communities thousands of years ago, and a testimony of the environmental conditions in which they lived.\nEngraved crocodiles, Messak, Libya\nby The British Museum\non Sketchfab\nThe Asahi Shimbun Display in Room 3 and the 3D reconstructions carried out by the African Rock Art Image Project are good examples of how new technologies and archaeological research can be combined to improve our understanding of past societies, and present this knowledge to the public.

The book\u2019s 13th-century author, Ab\u016b al-Q\u0101sim al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b, believed it held ancient secrets coded in hieroglyphic texts. He was right, but not exactly as he imagined!\nAb\u016b al-Q\u0101sim Mu\u1e25ammad ibn A\u1e25mad al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b, known as al-S\u012bm\u0101w\u012b (\u2018the practitioner of natural or white magic\u2019), was an author of books on alchemy and magic. He lived in Egypt during the reign of the Mamluk sultan Baybars I al-Bunduqd\u0101r\u012b (r. 1260\u20131277). His books were popular and survive in many copies, but almost nothing is known about al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b himself.\nThe Book of the Seven Climes is the earliest known study focused wholly on alchemical illustrations. The \u2018climes\u2019 (from which our word \u2018climate\u2019 is derived) are the seven latitudinal zones into which the astronomer and geographer Claudius Ptolemy divided the inhabited world in the 2nd century AD. Their mention in al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b\u2019s title expressed an intention for his book to be all-encompassing.\nAl-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b reproduced illustrations from earlier Arabic alchemical texts and tried to decode their mysterious symbols and allegories, annotating the illustrations with his own interpretations. But how faithful was he in copying the illustrations for his book, and what changes were made as they were copied and re-copied during the five centuries of transmission linking al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b\u2019s lost original to the 18th-century copy held at the British Library?\nLuckily, while al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b\u2019s 13th-century autograph manuscript is lost, one source of his illustrations is known to us: the Book of Images (Mu\u1e63\u1e25af al-\u1e63uwar). It is attributed to the 4th-century Egyptian alchemist Zosimos of Panopolis and preserved in a copy made in Egypt in 1270, during al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b\u2019s lifetime. The manuscript, now in Istanbul, could even be the one that al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b consulted.\nMatching illustrations in the 13th-century Book of Images (left) and the 18th-century copy of al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b\u2019s Book of the Seven Climes (right).

MS 25724, fol. 18v)\nAl-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b was usually careful to cite his sources by title and author, but the images in his work, at least in their 18th-century versions, show many changes and omissions. In addition, some of the pages were embellished with pseudo-hieroglyphs, perhaps a code for the Arabic alphabet, not present in the original.\nWhat did al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b make of the hieroglyphs in the illustrations? Were they all completely invented? To begin to understand this, it is worth examining a group of images in the Book of the Seven Climes, now on display\u00a0in the exhibition Egypt: faith after the pharaohs. Below we illustrate a key explaining the various elements. These have been numbered for ease of reference in the rest of our discussion.\nAl-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b states that the material on this page comes from a \u2018Hidden Book\u2019 attributed to Hermes Trismegistus (1), a legendary sage-king of ancient Egypt who was believed to have mastered the secrets of occult sciences such as alchemy and to have recorded them in hieroglyphs on the walls of temples and tombs. The ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, last written nine centuries before al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b\u2019s lifetime, were undecipherable to him and his contemporaries. Undeterred, and guided by the legend of Hermes Trismegistus, he gave the illustrated elements an alchemical interpretation. He refers to apparatus such as the distillation furnace (7) and the bain-marie (12), and to processes such as roasting (11) and blackening (2). Alchemical substances are referred to symbolically: the eagle (3, 4, 10) and the \u2018intensely black\u2019 raven (9) were widely employed as codes for sal ammoniac and for iron and/or lead, respectively.\nBut this page does not only contain alchemical secrets. The hieroglyphic composition in the lower panel is coherent enough to show that it was ultimately copied from an actual ancient monument. While distortions have crept in, the shapes of the hieroglyphs are not complete fantasy, unlike those of the interpolated pseudo-hieroglyphs mentioned further above. The Egyptologist Okasha El Daly first noted that the inspiration for the present image came from a stela carved in the name of King Amenemhat II, who ruled Egypt around 1922\u20131878 BC. Two of Amenemhat\u2019s official names can still be recognised (9 and 12).\nThe \u2018Horus name\u2019 identified a pharaoh as an incarnation of Horus, the god of kingship. It was written inside a serekh (9): a frame representing a palace, complete with a panelled fa\u00e7ade and with Horus, shown as a falcon, perched on top. In al-\u02bfIr\u0101q\u012b\u2019s illustration, these elements have undergone an alchemical transmutation: at some point the panels of Amenemhat\u2019s serekh were changed into curious implements, and the falcon into a raven! Despite further distortions, we can just discern the Horus name of Amenemhat II: Heken-em-maat, literally \u2018He who rejoices in justice\u2019. On the original monument the preposition \u2018in\u2019 was undoubtedly written with an owl. To suit the alchemist\u2019s agenda, it has here become a red eagle (10).\nA pharaoh\u2019s throne and birth names were traditionally written inside oval \u2018cartouches\u2019, to make them stand out from surrounding text. Unaware of this fact, al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b identifies just such a cartouche as \u2018Maria\u2019s bath\u2019, the bain-marie (12) or hot-water bath, which is named after the alchemist Maria the Jewess, and is still used today by the catering industry. The hieroglyphs enclosed by the present cartouche spelled out the throne name of Amenemhat II: Nub-kau-Ra, or \u2018The life-forces of Ra (the sun god) are of gold\u2019. In our manuscript a sun-disc (\u2018Ra\u2019) and a necklace (\u2018gold\u2019) have been transformed into a human face with neck and arms. Hieroglyphs above the cartouche still recognisably give two well-known royal epithets: \u2018the great god, lord of the Two Lands (Upper and Lower Egypt)\u2019 (11). Al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b interpreted the whole group as pertaining to \u2018roasting\u2019: apparently a hieroglyph representing a basket became a roasting dish, and two stretches of land below it became a grill! The hieroglyphs below the cartouche, in their ancient meaning, claim that the pharaoh is \u2018given life forever\u2019 (13).\nMonuments of Amenemhat II are rare and his stela is lost, so the exploits of our medieval alchemist hold value to modern Egyptology. Comparing al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b\u2019s drawing with extant stelae of similar date, we can determine more precisely how the stela of Amenemhat would have looked. The stela shown below, displayed in Room 65 of the British Museum, dates from the reign of his grandson, Senwosret III (around 1874\u20131855 BC). That king\u2019s Horus and throne names again take up two-thirds of the top. The remaining third mentions a deity (\u2018Horus-son-of-Isis\u2019), of whom the king is said to be \u2018beloved\u2019. The texts naming king and god were given opposed orientations, so that the actors involved \u2018look\u2019 at each other. The image in the Book of the Seven Climes reveals that Amenemhat, too, was described as \u2018beloved\u2019 of a deity (14), whose name must be sought in the hieroglyphs grouped on the left, likewise facing those naming the king. In our 18th-century copy most of these signs have been shuffled about and reshaped beyond recognition, but two of them read probably \u2018Wepwa(wet)\u2019, the name of a jackal god (16). Three hieroglyphs crammed in between the god\u2019s and the king\u2019s names, assuming the former\u2019s orientation, cite blessings bestowed on the latter: \u2018life, stability, dominion\u2019 (17).\nStela from the reign of Senwosret III, whose ornamental inscription at the top is laid out very similarly to that on the lost stela of Amenemhat II, as illustrated by al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b. (British Museum, 1861,0618.1)\nAmenemhat\u2019s ornamental inscription would have been bordered at the bottom by a stroke representing land and at the top by a band representing heaven, supported at the ends by divine sceptres symbolising the full extent of the king\u2019s god-given \u2018dominion\u2019. Only the top of the left-hand sceptre (18) has made it into our 18th-century manuscript, but its identity is unmistakable.\nThe very fact that a hieroglyphic inscription from around 1900 BC can still, in part, be read in an 18th-century copy of a 13th-century Arabic text testifies to the care Arabic scribes took in copying and recopying earlier manuscripts through the centuries. The inclusion of an authentic hieroglyphic text in the Book of the Seven Climes also demonstrates the interest in Egyptian antiquities taken by some medieval Arabic scholars. Al-\u02bfIr\u0101q\u012b\u2019s alchemical understanding of that text highlights the differences between medieval interpretative frameworks and those employed by the modern science of Egyptology.\nMore accurate copies of the Amenemhat inscription may still await discovery in unpublished earlier copies of al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b\u2019s Seven Climes in Dublin, Cairo or elsewhere. Furthermore, the identification of more works from which al-\u02bfIr\u0101q\u012b took his illustrations could bring us closer to the ancient monuments from which some of the illustrations were ultimately copied. We plan to study the other manuscripts of the Book of the Seven Climes and search for the sources of its illustrations. This will throw more light on how al-\u2018Ir\u0101q\u012b adapted his material and may enable a fuller reading of the original inscription of Amenemhat II. It might even reveal further authentic hieroglyphic texts."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/ten-years-of-the-asahi-shimbun-displays-focussing-in-on-objects-in-focus/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Ten years of the Asahi Shimbun Displays: focussing in on objects in focus", "author": "David Francis, Interpretation Officer and Laura Purseglove, Project Assistant", "timestamp": "2016-02-03 00:00:00", "text": "2015 saw the ten-year anniversary of the Asahi Shimbun Displays at the British Museum. Located in Room 3, to the right of the main entrance, these displays have provided the opportunity to focus in depth on individual objects within the Museum\u2019s collection. They were also conceived of as an experimental space, where the Museum could explore new methods of displaying and interpreting objects. Channelling this experimental spirit, members of the project team, Laura Purseglove and David Francis, engage in a critical dialogue in this blog post about the Asahi Shimbun Displays and the relationship to trends within museological and cultural theory.\nDF: One of the most innovative things about the Asahi Shimbun Displays has been the opportunity to tell stories about individual objects, which we wouldn\u2019t have the space for in the permanent galleries. In Room 70, the Roman Empire gallery, the Mero\u00eb head of Augustus is one of hundreds of objects and there is only scope to present the head as an example of Roman portraiture and tell the story of Augustus\u2019 rise to power.\nThe Asahi Shimbun Display The Mero\u00eb Head of Augustus: Africa defies Rome (11 December 2014\u201315 February 2015)\nDF: For The Mero\u00eb Head of Augustus: Africa defies Rome (2014) display, we were able to go into much more depth. This display explored Rome\u2019s relationship with the African kingdom of Mero\u00eb and the story of the object\u2019s discovery in the build-up to the First World War. It even made comparisons between the beheading of Augustus\u2019 statue and the toppling of a statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Iraq in 2003. In many ways this use of a single object to tell a wider historical narrative can be seen as a precursor to the A History of the World in 100 objects series broadcast on Radio 4 in 2010. That in turn has popularised an object-based approach to history \u2013 now objects are used to tell the story of lots of things, from baseball to Doctor Who.\nMarketing poster for The Asahi Shimbun Display Made in Africa (2005)\nLP: Yes, from a fine art perspective, which is my area of expertise, it\u2019s been interesting to see this renewed focus on objects, as opposed to context, in humanities scholarship and in our museums and galleries. You might say that the first display in 2005, Made in Africa, reflected this idea by consciously aestheticising three stone hand axes, encouraging visitors to engage directly with the objects\u2019 physical properties rather than seeing them as illustrative of a wider historical context. The hand axes themselves were presented as things to be experienced rather than \u2018read\u2019. This approach is mirrored in cultural theory, for instance in the ideas of philosopher Gilles Deleuze, who used the term \u2018affect\u2019 to frame the art object as a bundle of \u2018sensations\u2019 activated when perceived.\nThe Asahi Shimbun Display Akan drum: the drummer is calling me (12 August\u201310 October 2010)\nDF: In archaeology and anthropology as well, you have what\u2019s known as \u2018the material turn\u2019 \u2013 a focus on a thing\u2019s materiality as opposed to treating objects as \u2018texts\u2019 to be read. I\u2019m an interpretation officer and so my focus is very much on an object\u2019s relationship to text. This involves creating accessible text for a non-specialist audience, and also using objects to construct narratives about the past that allow us to better understand the present. At the same time, there are some things text alone cannot capture. The display Akan drum: the drummer is calling me (2010) told the story of the oldest African-American object in the Museum. Made in West Africa and collected in Virginia, this leather drum was brought to America as part of the transatlantic trade in enslaved Africans. As well as interrogating the terrible practices of the slave trade the display also looked at the transmission of musical heritage from Africa to America. We created an accompanying soundtrack, tracing early African drumming to the development of call and response and gospel music, and its development into jazz, blues, RnB and hip-hop. If you were to tell that story through text alone so much would be lost.\nThe Asahi Shimbun Display Xu Bing: Background Story 7 (12 May\u201310 July 2011)\nLP: Right, by not relying solely on text to explain an object we acknowledge that objects can\u2019t necessarily be reduced to their more \u2018textual\u2019 properties, they are more than the sum of their parts. For the display Xu Bing: Background Story 7 (2011) we experimented with a white cube display style, which privileges experiencing the object over explanation. The design encouraged viewers to encounter the object directly, with text positioned to the side so as not to interfere. The back of the installation revealed the materials Xu Bing used to create the illusion of a traditional Chinese scroll painting \u2013 debris and plant materials. We relied on the power of the object to draw visitors to the back of the screen. Signposting, on that occasion, would have detracted from the experience of encountering the work in an unmediated way.\nDF: You mentioned using a white cube approach and I think it\u2019s interesting how different disciplines have their own styles of display. If you think about the one object in a room approach, it can be seen as rooted in the tradition of the modernist art gallery. Although I suppose it has its origins in the treasuries of the medieval church, setting aside a relic or icon to be encountered and venerated. However, such an approach can limit the meanings of an object, especially when it\u2019s entangled within a wider network, or assemblage of objects.\nThe Asahi Shimbun Display Dressed to impress: netsuke and Japanese men\u2019s fashion (19 June\u201317 August 2014)\nDF: Since the publication of Edmund de Waals\u2019 The Hare with the Amber Eyes, netsuke have been popularly conceived as object d\u2019art \u2013 tiny, beautiful things to be collected and aestheticised. But this is only one aspect of their story. They\u2019re also part of a network of objects designed to provide a specific function. Japanese kimonos have no pockets and so, in the Edo Period, small personal items \u2013 such as tobacco or money \u2013 would be carried in a small pouch. Netsuke were used as toggles that allowed these pouches to be hung from the belt of the kimono. It is only by displaying the netsuke alongside a kimono and other accompanying male accessories that you can really understand their purpose, as well as appreciate their aesthetic qualities and idiosyncratic personalities.\nLP: Yes, the example of the Dressed to impress: netsuke and Japanese men\u2019s fashion (2014) display does point to the limits of the single object, unmediated approach. It\u2019s an example which demonstrates that sometimes objects need to be understood through their relation to other objects, but also that sometimes their meaning lies in their relationship with people.\nThe Asahi Shimbun Display Larrakitj: Aboriginal memorial poles by Wukun Wanambi (12 March\u201325 May 2015)\nLP: The Sikh Fortress Turban (2011) display presented a dastaar boonga turban as an example of a living tradition. It was co-curated by members of the Sikh community in London and placed their voices and experiences at the centre of the story. More recently, the Larrakitj: Aboriginal memorial poles by Wukun Wanambi (2015) display, an installation by the indigenous Australian artist, defined the piece in terms of its relationship to the artist and his\u00a0cultural heritage. A short film showing the artist talking about the work demonstrated that what makes the piece\u00a0so special is its connection to the artist\u2019s personal and clan histories, as well as the relationship to the landscape of Arnhem Land.\u00a0 But, that said, visitors could still enjoy the beauty and craftsmanship inherent in the work without watching the film.\u00a0So perhaps this leaves us in agreement; the Asahi Shimbun Displays are at their best when they reveal the ways in which our objects connect to the wider world but don\u2019t reduce them to mirrors of their contexts. It\u2019s the beautiful, strange, sometimes baffling nature of \u2018things\u2019 that makes us want to visit museums, isn\u2019t it?"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/how-do-you-put-on-a-torc/", "category": "Curator's corner", "title": "How do you put on a torc?", "author": "Julia Farley, Curator, British and European Iron Age Collections", "timestamp": "2016-01-29 00:00:00", "text": "As curator of the Celts exhibition, I got\u00a0to spend a lot of time showing people wonderful Iron Age treasures. Some of my favourites were\u00a0the big metal neck rings called torcs that were worn across much of Europe (and beyond) around 2000 years ago. One of the things I was\u00a0asked most often is, \u2018But how did you put them on?!\u2019 It\u2019s a very good question, seeing as they often look like solid metal rings with nowhere near enough space to squeeze your neck through.\n\nMany British torcs are a bit like this one:\nThe Snettisham Great Torc. 150-50 BC, Snettisham, UK, Electrum, Diam.19.9 cm, British Museum,\u00a01951,0402.2. (Photo: (c) The Trustees of the British Museum)\nAlthough this is one of the most famous examples, the form is typical: open at the front, with a flexible neck-ring made of coiled or twisted wires. This type of torc is put on and taken off by being bent out of shape. You can see that one of the terminals of this torc has been pulled slightly forward compared to the other one. This is the result of it being repeatedly pulled open to be slipped on. A re-enactor friend of mine has told me that he often puts a torc on from the front, and then twists it round to bring the terminals to the front. I\u2019ve tried with replicas, and I tend to slip mine on from the back, so there are different ways of doing it.\nThis constant flexing caused a lot of stress to the metal neck rings of the torc. When you bend metal in this way, it tends to harden and become brittle. You may have experienced this first hand if you have ever wanted to break off a piece of wire for hanging a picture or working in the garden and did this by bending it back and forth until it broke. The same thing happened to some torcs. We have many examples of truly beautiful neck-rings which were worn to destruction \u2013 taken on and off so many times that they broke at the back. They have often been somewhat clumsily repaired, as in this case:\nGold twisted torc. 150-50 BC, Snettisham, UK, Electrum, Diam. 21 cm, British Museum, 1991,0407.37\u00a0 (Photo: (c) The Trustees of the British Museum)\nThe break is covered with a thin sheet of gold foil, but X-radiography of the torc shows that all the wires have snapped! Torcs were quite fragile objects, and they were frequently broken and then repaired in this way. This is curious, because there was an easy way to avoid the problem. If you anneal the metal \u2013\u00a0heat it up to cherry-red temperature, around 600\u2013700 degrees centigrade \u2013\u00a0it re-softens. This would have been a simple matter with the technology available. So why were so many torcs allowed to break? And why do the repairs often look like shoddy afterthoughts?\nI wonder if being the proud owner of a \u2018vintage\u2019 torc (old enough to be in need of flamboyant repairs) might have been something to be proud of. Rather than an unfortunate accident, breakage could have been part of the natural lifecycle of a torc. The repaired torc pictured above was buried in a hoard with many other, much newer, ones. By the time it went into the ground, it was probably an heirloom object, perhaps as much as 100 years old. It would have been possible to carry out much more subtle repairs, but perhaps they were supposed to be obvious? Being a member of a family with such a long history of wealth and power was probably a source of great pride, and the repairs might have emphasised the age of the object, and reminded people of the many stories attached to it.\nI had a go at making a torc myself, closely based on this one:\nSilver torc of two strands twisted together with double-loop terminals. 150 \u2013 50 BC, Ken Hill, Silver, Diam. 18.8 cm, British Museum 1991,0407.24. (Photo: (c) British Museum)\nAlthough the wires are thick, it\u2019s actually much easier to bend open than you\u2019d think. I made my version\u00a0a few\u00a0years ago, and have used it regularly for teaching and outreach sessions, where it has been much manhandled, bent and stretched. The metal is just getting to the point where it is too stiff to allow this, and so I plan to anneal it soon to soften it up (I don\u2019t fancy breaking my own!) So the process of wear-hardening (especially on softer metals like gold and silver) probably took quite a long time.\nOn the Continent, there are other types of torc, which sometimes have clever hidden clasps, hinges, or removable sections such as these ones:\nLeft: Copper alloy torc. 350-250 BC, Pleurs, France, Copper alloy, Diam. 15.3 cm, British Museum, ML. 1621 (Photo: (c) The Trustees of the British Museum) Right: Copper alloy torc. 350-250 BC, Pleurs, France, Copper alloy, Diam. 13.9 cm, British Museum, ML. 1714\u00a0(Photo: (c) The Trustees of the British Museum)\nWhen worn they would have given the impression of a solid ring of metal, but in fact they were relatively easy to put on and take off.\nThe idea of a hinge was taken up in later British neck-rings found in south-western Britain. They have a discreet hinge at the back, and a clasp at the front that was hidden when the terminals were closed.\nCopper alloy hinged collar. AD 50 \u2013 150, Dorset, UK, Leaded brass, red enamel, Diam. 15.6 cm, British Museum, 1963,0407.1 \u00a0(Photo: (c) The Trustees of the British Museum)\nFrom these kinds of evidence, I strongly suspect that torcs were put on and taken off quite regularly, rather than being intended to be worn for very long periods of time. The most decorative were probably worn for special occasions, and some of the simpler designs may have been for everyday wear. But we have so little evidence for what constituted \u2018day-to-day wear\u2019 in the Iron Age that it\u2019s hard to be sure.\nBut there are some torcs which I don\u2019t think could be opened up, such as this one from Trichtingen in Germany, which also appeared in the Celts exhibition:\nSilberring von Trichtingen. 200-50 BC, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany, silver, iron, D 29.5 cm, W\u00fcrttembergisches Landesmuseum Stuttgart,\u00a0A 28/61.\u00a0(Photo: P. Frankenstein;H. Zweitasch; (c) Landesmuseum Wurttemberg, Stuttgart)\nThe gap isn\u2019t wide enough to squeeze your head in, and there is a solid iron core under the silver, so it couldn\u2019t have been bent. It also weighs nearly seven kilos! And if you did wear it, which way up would it go? It seems designed to be viewed upright, like in the picture. But with the terminals at the back the bulls would have been hidden, and with the terminals at the front their heads would be upside down, not to mention how uncomfortable those horns would be, sticking into your collar bone\u2026\nI think it\u2019s most likely that torcs such as the one above\u00a0weren\u2019t worn at all. They might have been symbols of status to be brandished aloft, rather than worn around the neck, just like the way that the antlered god on this plaque from the Gundestrup cauldron hefts a torc into the air, terminals upright.\nThe Gundestrup Cauldron. 100 BC \u2013 AD 1, Gundestrup, Denmark, Silver, partially gilded, Diam. 69 cm; H. 42 cm.

He had trained as a painter but he decided to take up photography because he found it more useful in studying his identity as an Egyptian.\n\u201cThe camera was and remains for me an instrument that allows me to go to places where I would not go otherwise. Of course, the point is to collect images; that is the compensation. Without photography, I would not have made the exploration, and I would have not had those contacts\u2026\u201d\nSalam, from the series Coptes du Nil, by Nabil Boutros, composition of three photographic prints, 1997\u20132004 (\u00a9 Nabil Boutros/The British Museum) donated by Rose Issa, 2015,6028.1.5-7\nBoutros grew up in a Coptic Christian family and decided to document the community in Egypt in order to better understand his own roots and to highlight the modern aspects of Coptic religious practice. Copts are one of the oldest Christian communities in the world. According to tradition, the church was founded by Saint Mark in Alexandria during the reign of the Roman emperor Nero (r. AD 54\u201368). Today, Copts make up about ten percent of the Egyptian population with a large diaspora living elsewhere.\nBoutros spent seven years, from 1997 to 2004, photographing the Coptic community around Egypt. He visited major historic sites such as the Monastery of Saint Paul (founded 5th century AD) and Deir El-Maymoun (founded AD 361\u2013363), and attended ceremonies that have continued for thousands of years. As a Copt himself, he wanted to highlight the contemporary individuals who visit and worship at these locations, or as he says, \u201cto get as close as possible to the quotidian.\u201d\nHe always includes people in his photographs, noting that Western photographers often depict these monuments without figures, as if they are no longer in use. His photographs often only show one or two people, even in the midst of large ceremonies. For example, he portrays a single woman in front of a small statue of the Virgin Mary at the pilgrimage to Deir Dronka, near Assiut, which draws thousands of people in August each year. In this way, he draws attention to individual worship and personal stories.\nVendredi Saint, from the series Coptes du Nil, by Nabil Boutros, composition of four photographic prints, 1997\u20132004 (\u00a9 Nabil Boutros/The British Museum) donated by Rose Issa, 2015,6028.1.1-4\n\u201cI knew it was a part of me, from my upbringing and my culture, but to be able to make the connection between things from the distant past with more contemporary things strengthened me. To know the history of things that I experienced personally, to understand the historical links allows me to find the foundation; that comforts me a lot, fulfils me.\u201d\nBoutros arranges his photographs in the same way as they are found in the screens of Coptic churches where Biblical stories are depicted (polyptychs). However, unlike church paintings, his compositions do not form a clear narrative. Instead each photograph in a composition is taken from a different time and place. Boutros explains that his photographs are not meant to be documentary but instead resist the viewer\u2019s preconceptions about the Coptic community. In his early photography exhibitions, he presented his photographs individually and allowed researchers to add text. However, he found in this case that the researcher\u2019s words took over the images and did not convey his original intentions.\n\u201cThis experience was a good lesson for me: I understood that if I did not engage in a discourse with the images, the written discourse would take the place of my intent. After that, I started to reclaim my photographs \u2013 on Copts, the city, etc. \u2013 and to create new compositions working with polyptychs. I also started adding titles, to indicate what I was talking about, but I could no longer content myself with the image alone\u2026I started to complicate things, first by combining groups of black and white images, and then by introducing strips of colour photography in-between the black and white photographs.\u201d\nIn response to an attack on a Coptic church in December 2010, Boutros and the artist Moataz Nasr, created a poster using another series by Boutros called Egyptians, in which he portrayed himself with different identities throughout the year. The poster included the slogan \u201cWe are all Egyptians\u201d (\u0643\u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0635\u0631\u064a\u0648\u0646), and was popular in Tahrir Square during the revolution.\nNabil Boutros and Moataz Nasr, All Egyptians, 2010 (\u00a9 Nabil Boutros)\nNabil Boutros was born in Cairo in 1954.

The Tanakh\u2019s three main divisions are: the Torah (i.e. Pentateuch or the Five Books of Moses), Nevi\u2019im meaning Prophets, and the Ketuvim or Writings. The word Tanakh is in fact an acronym based on the first consonantal letters of these principal sections.\nIn antiquity the ancient text of the Hebrew Bible was penned on scrolls made either of strips of parchment or papyrus. Bound books with pages known as codices (singular codex) appear in Judaism around the 8th century AD, although they may have been in use before then. Codices of the Hebrew Bible became abundant in the 10th century AD, and some, similar to the First Gaster Bible, have survived to this day.\nThe First Gaster Bible currently displayed in the British Museum\u2019s exhibition Egypt: faith after the pharaohs, shows visible signs of wear and tear. Its parchment pages boasting fine calligraphy, masoretic rubrics and gilded decorative motifs, testify nonetheless to its former glory. What would have originally been a complete codex of Ketuvim (Writings), the third main division of the Hebrew Bible, has survived in a fragmentary state comprising just sections from the Books of Psalms, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Ruth and Daniel.\nPsalm 71 with palmette (top left) and ornamental fillers.

The Masorah is a body of rules on the pronunciation, reading, spelling and cantillation of the scriptural text that ensured the correct transmission of the Hebrew Bible. It was developed by Jewish scholars known as the Masoretes (conveyors of tradition) who were active in Tiberias, in the Holy Land, between the 7th and 10th century AD. The Masoretes\u2019 greatest achievement was the compilation of a system of vowels and signs that established in writing the exact way of reading the consonantal Hebrew script, which had been previously riddled with ambiguities and uncertainties.\nThere are two main types of masoretic notation both of which have been penned in the First Gaster Bible: the large Masorah (masora magna) which is inscribed at the top and at the foot of pages, and the small Masorah (masora parva) which is written between the columns of text or in the margins. The former is keyed to the words in the text and contains old traditional readings and grammatical notes. It serves as a quality control system and protects the scriptural text from modifications. The latter is ampler and includes lists of entire passages from the biblical text distinguished by typical orthographic variants or other peculiarities.\nPsalm 102 with divisional motifs and a decorative chain executed in Islamic style; the masora magna in very small script can be seen above and beneath the textual columns. The First Gaster Bible, Or. 9879 f.23v \u00a9 British Library Board\nNamed after its illustrious last owner Dr Moses Gaster (1856\u20131939), the spiritual leader of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews\u2019 Congregation in London, the manuscript was created most probably in Egypt around the 10th century AD. The colophon \u2013 a statement at the end of a manuscript supplying facts about its production \u2013 is missing, thus nothing is known about the original commission. Its date and place of production have therefore been established through comparison with extant Hebrew Bibles written in Egypt and/or the Middle East between the 9th and 10th century.\nIt is interesting to note that, with very few exceptions, most of the surviving oriental Hebrew Bibles dating from the 9th\u201311th centuries are incomplete. The Aleppo Codex copied c. AD 930 \u2013 the oldest and most authoritative extant manuscript of the Hebrew Bible that was proofread and vocalised by Aaron ben Asher, one of the greatest Masoretes from Tiberias \u2013 is held in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem. The manuscript is incomplete, having lost apparently 196 of its 491 original pages. The oldest complete manuscript of the Hebrew Bible is the Leningrad Codex. Copied most probably in Egypt and dated to around AD 1010, it is preserved in the Russian National Library (Saltykov-Schendrin Public Library), St Petersburg.\nSection from the Book of Ruth (3:14\u20134:7) with masora parva penned between the columns and marginal decorations in Islamic style. The First Gaster Bible, Or. 9879 f.23v \u00a9 British Library Board\nNineteenth-century scholars argued that the early masoretic bibles were created by Karaites. Funded by Anan ben David (c. AD 715\u2013795 or 811) in Babylonia, the Karaites were a Jewish sect who split up from mainstream Judaism accepting the Tanakh as their only norm of religious authority. Some scholars went as far as maintaining that the most prominent Masorete Aaron ben Asher may have been a Karaite. Recent scholarship has firmly rejected this view claiming that he was in fact a rabbinic Jew. An illuminated specimen of a Karaite biblical text is displayed in this exhibition.\nIt is very likely that the First Gaster Bible was commissioned by a wealthy patron for a synagogue rather than for personal use. The manuscript is a very good example of manuscript illumination from the Islamic East, i.e. Babylonia, Egypt, Persia, Syria and the Holy Land. Islam\u2019s aniconic approach had a profound and lasting impact on Hebrew manuscripts created in Muslim lands. The decorations found in extant Hebrew Bibles produced in these areas strongly suggest that Jewish scribes and artists would have had access to decorated Islamic handwritten books which influenced their art. Like Qur\u2019ans, early Hebrew Bibles are devoid of human and animal imagery and their ornamentation is clearly functional. \u00a0Carpet pages with geometric and arabesque designs, micrography (patterned minute lettering) and divisional motifs adapted from Islamic art typify their decoration. In the First Gaster Bible there is an abundance of gilded decorative elements executed in Islamic style. These include undulating scrolls and spirals, foliage, interwoven buds, palmettes and golden chains.\nSection from Ecclesiastes (2:24\u20133:12) with masora magna and masora parva (above and between the columns of text) and Islamic style embellishments.

As papyrus conservator at the British Museum I have worked on a wide range of manuscripts held by our Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan over the years. The collection includes many fine examples of papyri from ancient Egypt such as temple accounts from Abu Sir dating from approximately 2400 BC, some of the longest and beautifully illustrated funerary rolls from throughout Egypt\u2019s long Pharaonic history, as well as literary texts and day to day legal documents. Working on such material has always been fascinating but I was particularly delighted to be able to work on these five papyri as they were excavated at Oxyrhynchus. The story of this excavation had fired my initial interest in papyrus as a paper conservation student many years ago.\nExamination under the microscope (prior to repair) of the Egypt Exploration Society\u2019s papyri.\nA group of papyrus rolls as excavated. (Courtesy of The Egypt Exploration Society and Imaging Papyri Project, Oxford)\nThe ancient town of Oxyrhynchus, meaning \u2018city of the sharp nosed fish\u2019, modern al-Bahnasa lying 120 miles south of Cairo, was excavated between 1896 and 1907 by papyrologists Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt. This excavation began as part of a systematic exploration of the sites of Greco-Roman settlements and their discoveries were made in the sandy mounds on the outskirts of the town. The mounds turned out to be \u2018drifts\u2019 of rubbish tips which proceeded to yield approximately half a million fragments of papyri with ancient texts including early Christian literature. Grenfell and Hunt spent six seasons at Oxyrhynchus and their discoveries were by far the most exciting of the time in terms of quantity and range of the manuscripts found. Here was found several centuries worth of archives where official and private documents collectively provided a rare insight into the everyday life of this Roman town\u2019s inhabitants during the 1st to 6th centuries AD. The papyri that came to the paper conservation studio included a rental agreement between two female monks leasing part of their home to a Jewish man (P.Oxy 3203) excavated in the first season, a small fragment containing the Greek Septuagint (P.Oxy 3522) and another depicting an informal drawing of Daniel in the lion\u2019s den, both excavated in the fourth season. It is unknown during which season the last two papyri were found but they addressed matters relating to the Roman requirement for all citizens to sacrifice to the gods and include a Certificate of Sacrifice (P.Oxy 3929) and a letter from a Chrisitian man named Copres about a way to avoid the obligation (P.Oxy 2601).\nThe Cyperus papyrus L. plant.\nUndoubtedly helped by the dry climate of Egypt, papyrus has proved to be a very durable writing material with remarkable powers of preservation. Made from Cyperus papyrus L., a sedge plant about four metres high that grew plentifully along the banks of the Nile in antiquity, a sheet a papyrus was made from sections of the lower part of the stem where it was at its thickest. The outer rind is peeled off to reveal a spongy white inner pith which can be sliced longitudinally to make thin strips. These strips are laid side by side to form one layer before laying a second layer on top at right angles, then pressing and drying the whole. Individual sheets made in this way could then be joined to form a roll.\nA peeled section of the lower stem showing the pith inside being peeled into strips.\nTwo layers of strips are laid at right angles over each other. The two layers are then pressed together to form, when dry, a sheet of the writing material.\nThe five papyri for the exhibition were in need of minor repair and all except the small fragment of Daniel were in need of remounting between new sheets of glass. It was decided to exhibit Daniel in a passe-partout without glass to try and enhance viewing for the visitor. Generally papyri are so fragile that glass mounts are necessary for their protection but in this case, the fragment being small and in reasonable condition, an exception was made for the duration of the exhibition.\nThe papyrus in it\u2019s old mount.\nThe old mount with the papyrus removed showing a thick salt bloom.\nThe papyrus in a new glass mount.\nAll the papyri were examined under magnification before opening the old glass mounts and starting any treatment. Once opened a bloom or \u2018halo\u2019 could be immediately seen on the old glass, in the case of P. Oxy 3203 it was very pronounced. This is a common feature with papyri enclosed in glass, particularly those found by excavating rubbish tips where they are found together with other material such as potsherds, ash, charcoal, rags, straw, and various kinds of kitchen waste. In this type of archaeological context papyri will absorb soluble salts. When later enclosed in glass, and even in conditions where relative humidity changes very little, the salts absorb small amounts of moisture from the surrounding air. As the air slowly dries out again these soluble salts migrate outwards and deposit themselves on the nearest surface which in this case is the glass. This can happen repeatedly over the years and a substantial \u2018bloom\u2019 can build up inside the mount making the papyrus quite hard to read. Scientific analysis has found the bloom to consist of mainly sodium chloride, common salt, and it can be wiped off the glass very easily. However the Oxyrhynchus papyri were all remounted in new glass for the exhibition.\nRepairing a loose fragment of P.Oxy 3203 using small \u2018tabs\u2019 applied with tweezers.\nBefore remounting some conservation work was undertaken on the manuscripts. This involved laying back loose or twisted fibres and repairing along fractures. Repairs \u2013 in this case small pieces of Japanese paper, used for its strength and quality and toned to a sympathetic colour \u2013 are applied to the papyri with starch paste. The newly mounted papyri now take their place in the exhibition alongside the other fascinating objects that tell the story of faith after the pharaohs."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/wayfinding-the-bridget-riley-art-foundation-and-central-saint-martins-at-the-british-museum/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "'Wayfinding': The Bridget Riley Art Foundation and Central Saint Martins at the British Museum", "author": "Sarah Jaffray, Project Officer: Bridget Riley Art Foundation, Prints and Drawings", "timestamp": "2015-10-22 00:00:00", "text": "A new display entitled \u2018Wayfinding\u2019 has been put up in Room\u00a090 as part of the Bridget Riley Art Foundation (BRAF) Programme at the British Museum. For this exhibition of 14 works I have paired the drawings of BA Fine Art students from Central Saint Martins with the works that inspired them during their visit to the Prints and Drawings Study Room. The display explores drawing as a tool that artists, both emerging and established, use to find their way. Their \u2018way\u2019 may be an examination of their artistic process, the development or destruction of a personal style or the path to a finished work. Regardless of what form the path takes, drawing is a method through which an artist can clarify their direction.\nThe BRAF Programme is a three year project in the Department of Prints and Drawings that supports two posts: a project curator, Isabel Seligman, and myself as project officer. A key part of the programme is to research the drawing practice of emerging artists, specifically university art students. In the past year we have brought almost 500 students into the Prints and Drawings Study Room to take inspiration from drawings. We do this through curating and leading workshops, and selecting works from the Museum\u2019s rich drawing collection, one that stretches from the fifteenth century to the present day. Responses from the students and tutors have been invaluable to our understanding of the role of drawing in contemporary arts practice and education. These insights have also contributed to Isabel\u2019s curation of an exhibition of British Museum drawings that will tour the UK in 2016\u20132017.\nThroughout the project, we have been privileged to work with many bright and engaged young artists, but we were particularly lucky to spend a significant amount of time with a small group of second year students from Central Saint Martins. Organised by their pathway leader Anne Eggebert and led by their tutor, artist Rachel Cattle, the course was entitled \u2018On not knowing \u2013 drawing at the British Museum\u2019. The title comes from Bridget Riley\u2019s essay \u2018At the End of My Pencil\u2019, published by the London Review of Books in 2009. In the essay Riley states that, for her, \u2018drawing is an inquiry, a way of finding out \u2013 the first thing that I discover is that I do not know.\u2019\nThe course encouraged students to discover more about their own practice through the journey of drawing rather than working towards a defined, end point. By recognising that they \u2018do not know\u2019, the artists were freed from any limitations that might stifle true exploration.\nOver the course of three months, we witnessed the students\u2019 drawing practice reveal new directions in their work, as they responded to artists exploring similar ideas. The following works are just a few examples.\nThe Boxer, by Leo Claudon, acrylic on paper, 2015. (\u00a9 Leo Claudon)\nLeo Claudon found resonance with Picasso\u2019s idea that in the metamorphosis of a picture \u2018one might discover the path followed by the brain\u2019. Instead of working from a defined concept, Claudon lets his drawing unfold through a series of reactions to line and form. This allows Claudon to draw without restriction; the work that emerges is a response to the energy of the moment in which it was drawn. The raw, overlapping lines that construct the muscular energy of the boxer show the artist\u2019s process, the metamorphosis of his picture.\nConversing to/about form and surface. \u2013 Blue You & An introductory artist\u2019s lecture, by Jordan Mouzouris, 2015, mixed media. (\u00a9 Jordan Mouzouris)\nJordan Mouzouris was inspired by the pulsating rhythms of a drawing by Mannerist artist Bronzino. Mouzouris\u2019s piece was created with a method known as concrete poetry. In this practice, the artist uses visual composition to guide interpretation of text. Mouzouris frequently works from this method, sketching and arranging word and image in his notebook. It is no surprise that the artist connected to Bronzino, an artist who was not only a painter, but an accomplished poet.\nAur\u00e9lie Poux drew\u00a0Untitled shortly after working from a drawing by British abstract artist Paule V\u00e9zelay. Poux\u2019s modulations of grey and subtlety of line are experiments drawn from what the artist has called \u2018V\u00e9zelay\u2019s silent delicacy\u2019. The stability of Poux\u2019s monumental figures is undone by the cracks and fissures that materialise from the drawing\u2019s gradation of tone. Her meticulously drawn surface is intended to create an unsettling contradiction between youth and decay. Through exploration of V\u00e9zelay\u2019s graphic mark-making and tonal variation, Poux found the artistic language she needed to confront the difficult subject of sickness and abuse through aesthetically pleasing form.\nUntitled, by Aur\u00e9lie Poux, 2015, graphite on BFK Rives paper. (\u00a9 Aur\u00e9lie Poux)\nBeyond these artworks, visitors can also see the drawings of George Grosz, Frank Auerbach, Sol LeWitt and Giuseppe Galli Bibiena paired with responses from emerging artists Katherine Illingworth, Isabelle Cole, Pooja Patel and Rianne Owen.\nThe works in the display demonstrate the diversity of artistic experience that drawing can unlock. In drawing from drawings these artists were able to examine and explore their own artistic process from a different perspective. Much more than direct copying, their responses were pathways to discovery.\nI hope this blog inspires people to come and see the display of student work and the works that inspired them. I also hope this inspires people to come and use the Study Room, where over 2 million works on paper can be seen first-hand. The display is in Room 90 through the first week of November.

Organised in partnership with National Museums Scotland, this is the first major exhibition to explore the full history of Celtic art and identity \u2013 but who were the Celts?\nClassical authors conjure up a fantastical picture of a strange people, unfamiliar to the civilised inhabitants of Greece and Rome. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, writing in the first century BC, tells us that they were prone to arrogance and overindulgence \u2013 addicted to wine and frequently drinking so much that they fell into a stupor. The men grew their moustaches so long that when they were drinking, it was as if the liquid passed through \u2018a kind of strainer\u2019. They dressed ostentatiously in brightly coloured shirts and trousers, and striped or checked coats. They were hospitable hosts, welcoming strangers to their feasts, but they were fierce warriors, and quick to take offence at the smallest provocation. In battle, some charged into the fray naked, while others wore elaborate horned or animal-crested helmets, perhaps like the example below, dredged from the River Thames near Waterloo. Yet Diodorus also remarks that, for all their warlike swagger and boastfulness, these were not an uneducated people. He writes that they spoke in riddles, hinting darkly at their meaning and using one word to stand for another. Among their number were poets, and philosophers who could foretell the future and were so well respected that they could halt an army in full charge.\nHorned helmet. Bronze, glass, c.150\u201350 BC. Found near Waterloo, along the River Thames, London. W. (between horns) 42.5 cm. British Museum 1988,1004.1\nThis is an immediate and engaging picture, but it leaves us with more questions than answers. These ancient descriptions might be very rich, but they are varied, and very few are based on first-hand evidence, so the real people behind these stereotypes continue to elude us. Sources vary on where and when these people lived. There are few objects to show us how the Celts represented themselves, although the extraordinary silver cauldron from Gundestrup in Denmark (pictured below)\u00a0shows people wearing and using Celtic objects, and coins made in the Celtic world reveal a complex and varied iconography. The Celts left no written records of their own to tell us about their society, or whether indeed they were a unified group. It is much more likely that their lives revolved around smaller tribal, ethnic or family units. Much of their world is lost to us, but archaeology is gradually filling in the details of how these peoples lived.\nCauldron. Silver, partially gilded, 100 BC\u2013AD 1. Gundestrup, Denmark. Diam. 69 cm; H. 42 cm. (c) The National Museum of Denmark.\nCelts: art and identity tells the story of the Celts through the incredible objects they made. Shortly after 500 BC, around the time the Parthenon was being erected in Athens, a very different art was taking shape north of the Alps. In contrast to the clean, naturalistic lines of Greek art, the peoples that Greek writers would come to call the Celts were inventing their own way of representing the world. Theirs was an abstract, shapeshifting art, which writhes and transforms in the eye of the beholder. From one angle a sinuous line might resemble leafy tendrils, from another perspective it resolves into a hidden beast or bird. On close inspection, the swirling plant-like decoration on the\u00a0circular shield boss from Wandsworth (pictured below)\u00a0becomes two waterbirds, rearing back with wings outstretched, each with a single webbed foot curling down in front of its hooked beak. Like the riddling speech alluded to by Diodorus, the simple lines and curving forms of this Celtic art hint at complex meanings which could only be decoded by those familiar with its mysteries, a knowledge now long forgotten.\nShield boss. Copper-alloy, 350\u2013150 BC. Found in Wandsworth, on the bed of the River Thames, London. Diam. 32.8 cm. British Museum 1858,1116.2\nBy around 300 BC, versions of this art style had spread across Europe, from the Atlantic to the Black Sea. Although Britain and Ireland were never explicitly referred to as Celtic by the Greeks and Romans, they were part of this world of shared art, values and beliefs. Where the Greeks, and later the Romans, saw a single people, archaeology reveals a mosaic of communities, connected but also locally distinct.\nThe torc (a kind of metal neck-ring) is one example of how our understanding has changed. To the ancient Greeks and Romans, torcs were a universal symbol of Celtic identity, but in fact it was not an exclusively Celtic phenomenon. Men and women across Europe and beyond wore torcs to display their power and status. Even within the Celtic world, the shape, design and decoration of these neck-rings varied from region to region, and it is likely that they were used to express local identities, rather than a universal \u2018Celtic\u2019 one. A stunning example (pictured below), a silver torc from Trichtingen in Germany on loan from the W\u00fcrttembergisches Landesmuseum in Stuttgart, weighs over 6 kg. The terminals are made in the shape of cow or bull heads, each wearing a tiny torc of its own.\nTorc. Silver, iron, 200\u201350 BC. Trichtingen, Germany. Diam. 29.5 cm. (Photo: P. Frankenstein/H. Zweitasch; (c) Landesmuseum Wurttemberg, Stuttgart 2015)\nBy around 50 BC, life across much of Europe was changing. From around 200 BC, Roman control had gradually expanded to create an empire that extended from Spain to Syria and across North Africa. After the conquest of Britain in AD 43, the lives of the local inhabitants were dramatically transformed, both within the Roman province of Britannia and beyond its frontiers. In the south, the Roman army led the construction of forts, towns and cities with new facilities like amphitheatres and bathhouses. Local people mixed with invaders and settlers from around the empire, creating a cosmopolitan world where Roman and indigenous ways of life combined to create a unique Romano-British culture. Ireland and northern Scotland were never conquered, but people were still affected by the impact of Rome. Communities here found themselves the neighbours of a powerful empire, and responded by creating objects that reflected their independent, non-Roman identities. One such example is the massive armlet (the technical archaeological name!) from Belhelvie, on loan from the National Museum of Scotland. It was made in Scotland while southern Britain lay under Roman rule, and is decorated with a distinctive local style of art that echoes earlier Iron Age motifs.\nMassive armlet. Copper-alloy, AD 50\u2013150. Belhelvie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. H. 11.5 cm. National Museums Scotland, Edinburgh.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, a distinctive form of Christianity emerged in Ireland, Scotland and western Britain, regions which were outside the old heartlands of Roman control. Monasteries in these areas stood out as European centres of art and learning. Although connected to wider Christian communities across Europe, they continued to develop their own local traditions, and their languages, art and religious practices set them apart.\nThe name \u2018Celts\u2019 had fallen out of use after the Roman period, but it was rediscovered during the Renaissance, when people became more interested in understanding their own local histories. From the 16th century, \u2018Celts\u2019 was used as shorthand for the pre-Roman peoples of western Europe. In the early 1700s, the languages of Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Cornwall, Brittany and the Isle of Man were given the name \u2018Celtic\u2019 to reflect their pre-Roman origins. In the context of a continually shifting political and religious landscape, \u2018Celtic\u2019 acquired a new significance as the peoples of these Atlantic regions sought to affirm their difference and independence from their French and English neighbours, drawing on long histories of distinctive local identities. Over the following centuries, a Celtic revival movement led to the creation of a rich, reimagined and romanticised Celtic past, expressed in art and literature.\nAlthough the Celts are not a single people, a distinct race or genetic group that can be traced through time, the idea of a Celtic identity still resonates powerfully today, all the more so because it has been continually redefined to echo contemporary concerns over politics, power and religion. The word Celtic continues to strike a chord, both nationally and globally. For most people, it has now come to stand for the distinctive local histories, traditions, music and languages of the modern Celtic nations: Brittany, Cornwall, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Scotland and Wales, and for people around the world who trace their ancestry back to these regions. \u2018Celtic\u2019 is still a word that creates a sense of difference, but what began as a label applied to outsiders by the ancient Greeks has now been proudly embraced to express a sense of shared heritage and belonging, reflecting a long history of regional difference and independence."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-mystery-of-the-fetter-lane-hoard/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "The mystery of the Fetter Lane hoard", "author": "Amelia Dowler, Curator of Greek and Roman Provincial Coins and Andrew Shore", "timestamp": "2015-08-27 00:00:00", "text": "In 1908 workmen excavating foundations for a house in Fetter Lane (City of London) found 46 coins in a pot. The Rev\u2019d FD Ringrose purchased the hoard and published an account in 1911 but focussed on describing the coins rather than the circumstances of the find. By the time the coins were bequeathed to the British Museum in 1914, there was no trace of the pot and no description of it either. There is no full account of exactly how the hoard was found and whilst Roman hoards are often uncovered in Britain (for example the Didcot, Hoxne and Beau Street hoards), the Fetter Lane hoard remains something of a mystery.\nThe Fetter Lane coins were all minted in Alexandria, in Egypt, between AD 58 and AD 284. At this period in the Roman Empire, official coins were produced at centrally controlled mints for use across the empire. However, many other mints also produced civic coins, usually in copper alloys, to be used in the local area. Coins had first been minted in Alexandria under the Ptolemaic dynasty (c.312\u201330 BC), which continued after Egypt became a Roman province in 30 BC. Unlike in most other provinces, Alexandria was a centrally controlled mint and the coins were initially made of debased silver before declining into a mainly copper alloy coinage. They circulated locally in the eastern Mediterranean and did not form part of the official Roman denomination system.\nThe earliest dated coin in the hoard (Year 5: 58/59 AD), depicting Nero. British Museum 1914,0403.2\nCoins used in the Roman province of Britannia were from official Roman mints and we know this both from coin finds and from references to coins at the time, such as at\u00a0Vindolanda. Why then would these Alexandrian coins be brought to Britain where they formed no part of the currency system?\nOver the past 200 years or so when unusual coins like these have been found in Britain they have often been dismissed as modern imports, perhaps brought back to the country as souvenirs from the Grand Tour, or by soldiers returning from service. There is a long history of these finds being dismissed, particularly by coin experts in museums and universities. I am compiling a catalogue of this material to look into this question further: are coins from the Mediterranean world (and sometimes further afield) modern losses or did they arrive in Iron Age or Roman times? These are coins \u2013 minted between the 5th century BC up to the end of the 3rd century AD \u2013 which would not have been part of a currency system in Britain.\nThe latest dated coin in the hoard (Year 2: 283/4 AD), depicting Carinus. British Museum 1914,0403.46\nThis is a particularly relevant question today when the Portable Antiquities Scheme is regularly listing coins with similar origins to the database. The steadily increasing number of \u2018foreign\u2019 coins means that it is important to readdress this question rather than dismissing it out of hand. There are examples both of coins being found in known contexts, such as in the Sacred Spring in Bath, and also where we know that coins were modern imports, such as the Alexandrian coins found on the wreck of the HMSPomone. For the majority of coins however we have no clear information about their findspots.\nWhere does this leave the Fetter Lane hoard? The fact that the coins were found together is also unusual: when \u2018foreign\u2019 coins like these are found they are usually single finds or are a rare foreign inclusion in a group of imperial Roman coins. The coins look in similar condition so it is quite likely that they were a group for some time despite the date range of the coins from AD 58 (during the reign of Nero) to AD 284 (during the reign of Carinus). It is unfortunate that the pot they were found in has been lost, as that might have supplied more information about what period they were deposited. There are a few plausible options to consider.\nThe coins could have been brought back as a souvenir group from Egypt by a Grand Tourist or by someone, perhaps a soldier, transiting through the Suez Canal. Souvenirs of this sort were fairly common and would have been reasonably cheap to buy locally in Egypt. After this they may have been put into a pot as a foundation deposit for a house in Fetter Lane at some point in the 1800s and were then found in 1908 during further works.\nThe coins could have been collected together in antiquity and deposited together during the Roman occupation of London (Londinium) after AD 50. From the dates of the coins themselves, this would have to have been after AD 284 when Londinium was a thriving Roman city. But why would this have happened? It is possible that these coins were collected together by a traveller or trader coming to London at this period. We know that the population of Londinium contained many foreigners who arrived during this time so the city was quite well connected to the rest of the Roman world. Perhaps these were kept as a memento of home or travels, or deposited for safe-keeping or as an offering for a safe journey to London.\nAnother intriguing proposition is that during the 3rd century AD there was a monetary crisis across the Roman Empire and at the turn of the century Roman coinage was reformed. At this point, local coinages ceased, leaving only the official Roman imperial mints producing coins. In Alexandria minting ceased in AD 297, shortly before the official reforms. It is possible that the coins were gathered together and brought westwards to fill gaps in the available currency, officially or unofficially. Or simply that when these coins became defunct they were gathered together to be used as a source of metal or kept by people thinking that one day they could use them again. However, there is no contemporary, corroborating evidence for these proposals other than the fact that there was a monetary crisis and a coinage reform.\nImage of the Fetter Lane hoard at the British Museum.

I was not, however, expecting a 3.5 m x 3 m, 16th-century print collage.\nAs readers of Joanna Kosek\u2019s previous article on this project will know, the task of unframing Albrect D\u00fcrer\u2019s Triumphal Arch and transporting the work to the conservation studio was a major undertaking on its own. Now that the work is in the studio, the even trickier question arises: how do you clean the centre of such a large print? Unfortunately, as high-tech as the brand new studios here at the British Museum are, the option of having conservators suspended from the ceiling like ninjas, was not part of the design brief. A more practical option was designed by heads of department, Joanna Kosek and Caroline Barry, along with the conservation mounters.\nTo transport the print to the studio, a large tube was designed and created to gently roll up the Triumphal Arch. A secondary, smaller tube was then created to catch the print as it was\u00a0partially unrolled onto the table. The surface of the print could then be cleaned in horizontal bands across the edge of the table and then rolled beneath the table surface onto the\u00a0second roll in stages.\nDiagram of the surface cleaning set-up for D\u00fcrer\u2019s Triumphal Arch.\nAlthough the print has been behind glass for at least 30 years there is still some surface dirt. If dust and dirt were not removed at this early stage then any subsequent wet treatments would fix the dirt in the paper fibres. While the surface cleaning of the print continues, the team carefully documents all aspects of condition and structure of each sheet of paper: everything from tiny pinholes to large watermarks and embossings. This information helps to inform us of the history of the print and will come in very useful during the next stages of treatment. To do this, thin sheets of transparent polyester are placed over each of the 42 individual pages that make up the image, and all characteristics of the page are mapped using permanent markers and a key of symbols created specially for this project by conservator, Megumi Mizumura.\nConservators Emma Webb (left) and Megumi Mizumura (right) mapping out damage to individual pages of D\u00fcrer\u2019s Triumphal Arch.\nOnce the mapping is complete, the fun begins! The conservation team has been hard at work for several weeks now using a variety of different dry sponges, erasers and brushes to lift the surface dirt from the print, taking care to avoid all printed media. This means using magnification and a steady hand to carefully clean in between each printed letter\u2026 for 10 square-metres. Luckily for us summer students, the conservation team have been happy to let us step in and get involved.\nConservation student placements, Tom Bower (left), Carina Rosas (centre) and Lauren Buttle (right) surface-cleaning D\u00fcrer\u2019s Triumphal Arch.\nThe cleaning continues in the studio for now.

The British Museum\u2019s newly commissioned photographic studio was cleared for two days and D\u00fcrer\u2019s masterpiece was expertly transported down the six flights of stairs and carefully unrolled in the main studio. Because of the fragility of the print we were unable to position the work vertically, which would have made our work considerably easier, so it was delicately unrolled on the floor. The challenge was then how to get high enough over the print to get it all within one shot. This was the first real test of the new facility. We decided to use a mobile extendable work platform (MEWP). Since the studio had been designed to enable access to\u00a0and photography of large objects, we had sufficient space to manoeuvre.\nCarefully unrolling the print ready for photography, with the mobile extendable work platform in place.\nSenior photographers, Kevin Lovelock and Saul Peckham used their skills to light the print to give an even and colour-balanced appearance, and also employed a raking light technique to highlight areas of special interest to both conservators and curators.\nThe print recto (front) in direct light.\nThe print verso (back) in raking light.\nWhile the print was in the photographic studio, scientists Joanna Russell, Joanne Dyer and Antony Simpson took the opportunity to capture some detail shots using infrared and ultraviolet imaging.\nJoanna Russell setting up the ultraviolet and infrared photography apparatus.\nDetail of cotton backing with embossed reversed \u20181515\u2019, the date in which the printing of the Arch commenced.\nVisible light is only a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum \u2013\u00a0beyond the red end of the visible spectrum is infrared radiation, and beyond the violet end is ultraviolet light. This non-visible radiation can also be recorded in images, by using special lights, cameras and filters. These imaging techniques may tell us more about the materials or construction of an object or artwork, depending on the ways the materials interact with the different wavelengths of light.\nThe ink used for the print absorbs infrared radiation, so appears clearly in these images, and is likely to be a carbon-based ink. However, an ink inscription becomes invisible in the infrared image, showing it is made using a different type of ink, probably iron gall ink.\nLeft: A visible image of a detail from the Arch.

The enormous print, produced at the height of D\u00fcrer\u2019s career to glorify the reign of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I (r. 1486\u20131519), appeared appropriately majestic in the softly lit room and attracted over 70,000 visitors in three months. Originally designed to be pasted on the walls of princely castles, the impression at the British Museum was never used as originally intended, and is one of only a handful to have survived. In the Museum the print, which measures four metres by three metres, had been lined onto a textile backing and had long been displayed in a massive frame by the Gallery Caf\u00e9. After the Room 3 show it was time to take the print down to inspect, conserve and store it in darkness to help preserve it.\nDismantling the exhibition started with detaching the glazing which consisted of three four-metre-high pieces of laminated glass that had been painstakingly installed back in September by expert glass handlers.\nNow we watched the delicate operation of lifting the heavy glass in the reverse order of installation and, yet again, held our breath when giant suckers manoeuvred the heavy green-tinted glass panes, one by one, to expose the beautiful cream-coloured early 16th-century paper.\nDetaching the glazing from the print.\nIn the meantime, in preparation for taking the print down, we had constructed a huge half-metre-diameter tube in the Museum\u2019s state-of-the-art Paper Conservation Studio. This \u2018quicker-by-tube\u2019 production needed to be sturdy but light. As nothing like this was commercially available, the team of conservation mounters made their own using transparent plastic sheeting filled in with foam padding and cardboard rings to prevent collapse, which could damage the print. There was a lot of laughter as two\u00a0of the team\u00a0plunged inside the roll to fix the padding! No effort was spared to make the roll perfect for the job.\nThe specially made tube being carried to Room 3 via the Great Court.\nThe day of the great descent arrived on 17 November.

When you see the sculptures on display, you might be forgiven for thinking that the standard dress for men, in ancient Athens especially, was a state of undress. The Greeks, if their art is anything to go by, spent a lot of time starkers.\nAlthough we must separate art from life, nevertheless, they enjoyed many more occasions for nudity than any other European civilisation before or since. The reason why they performed athletics in the nude was said to be because, in the early Olympic Games, a runner lost his knickers and as a result also lost the race. That story may be true or not but either way, it doesn\u2019t explain the true nature of Greek athletic nudity as an expression of social, moral and political values.\nThe Westmacott Athlete. Roman marble copy of a Greek bronze original. 1st century AD, Marble, H: 150 cm, W: 61 cm, British Museum\u00a01857,0807.1. (Photo: (c) British Museum)\nThe circumstances in which men and boys appeared naked were dictated by an exclusive attachment to certain values held by an elite \u2018club\u2019 of male citizens. To be naked was not the same as to be nude. The first befits manual workers or those engaged in lewd behaviour. Nudity by contrast was the uniform of the righteous. When a young man in ancient Athens exposed his athletic body to his peers, he was not asserting his sexuality, rather, he was demonstrating his qualification to compete in athletics and at the same time to be worthy of putting on a second skin of bronze and defending his city on the battlefield. Such young men were called Kaloi and Agathoi, that is to say, the beautiful and the good. Death in battle was the Kalos Thanatos or the beautiful death.\nThere is an interesting anecdote recorded in the life of the 5th-century BC philosopher Socrates, when he meets a fellow citizen Epigenes by chance. Socrates remarked tactlessly that his friend was looking rather chubby, which was rich coming from Socrates who, although he was a brave soldier, was notoriously pug-faced and pot-bellied. Epigenes told Socrates it wasn\u2019t his business. He was now not in the army and, as a private citizen, he didn\u2019t have to go to the gymn. Socrates replies that Epigenes owed it to his city and himself to be as fit and beautiful as possible. It was, said Socrates, the moral duty of every citizen to maintain himself in readiness in case called upon to defend his city. And besides, Epigenes was obliged to keep himself as pretty as he could be, while he was still young. The Greek body beautiful was a moral condition and one to which only the Greeks among the peoples of the ancient world were attached. Neither the Egyptians, nor the Assyrians, Persians or the Cypriots cultivated in art and in life ideal nudity.\nBronze statuette of a veiled and masked dancer. Hellenistic, 3rd\u20132nd century BC, Bronze, H: 20.5 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. 1972.118.95. (Photo: (c) Metropolitan Museum of Art)\nThe ideal Greek male body, then, is at the very heart of the Greek experience. Female nudity was much rarer than male nudity and the wives of well-to-do citizens were expected to stay indoors preserving their reputations with their pale complexions. Sculptors become increasingly skilled at showing the body beneath thin tissues of drapery and to judge from such objects as terracotta figurines and white marble sculpture, women were adept at flaunting their figures using drapery as a means of exaggerating their shape and so drawing attention to the body beneath. Aphrodite, goddess of love, is alone among the female Olympian gods in being represented naked. Hers is an ambiguous presence, however, for crouching or standing at her bath she appears to lure us in to erotic pleasure, only then to punish us for having the presumption to gaze upon her divine beauty.\nLely\u2019s Venus.

(Photo: (c) British Museum)\nTo conclude, the Greek body is a pictorial sign through which the Greek experience is communicated. Nudity in ancient Greece was all part of an obligation to promote moral values that were amplified and endorsed through the culture of athletics and military training."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/bringing-a-ming-painting-back-to-life/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Bringing a Ming painting back to life", "author": "Carol Weiss, Conservator of Chinese Paintings and Jin Xian Qiu, Senior Conservator of Chinese Painting", "timestamp": "2014-12-08 00:00:00", "text": "On entering the BP exhibition Ming: 50 years that changed China, one of the first objects visitors see is a large silk painting depicting an official in front of Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City. This Ming dynasty painting by artist Zhu Bang was conserved especially for the exhibition, using traditional Chinese scroll mounting techniques that have been passed down from master to student since before this 500-year-old painting was even painted.\nThe British Museum is extraordinarily fortunate to have as its Senior Conservator of Chinese Paintings Mrs Jin Xian Qiu, who originally trained and worked in Shanghai Museum before coming to the British Museum 27 years ago. It is thanks to her expertise that many of the Museum\u2019s Chinese paintings can be displayed today. For this particular project, along with the help of her assistants and colleagues in the Hirayama Studio (part of the British Museum\u2019s Department of Conservation and Scientific Research, working on East Asian paintings) Mrs Qiu was joined by Mr Chu Hao, a Senior Paintings Conservator from Shanghai Museum, who assisted with some of the processes that make up this painstaking treatment.\nAnonymous, Portrait of an offical in front of the Beijing imperial palace, hanging scroll, ink and colours on silk, c. 1480-1580 (British Museum 1881,1210,0.87.CH). Before treatment.\nTraditionally, East Asian scroll paintings are habitually conserved and cared for over the course of their lifetimes by a process of remounting. The paintings themselves are cleaned and repaired, whilst the surrounding silk borders and accompanying lining papers are replaced with new materials. It is because of this remounting that many silk paintings survive today as hanging scrolls. Because our painting was in poor condition, it was decided to completely remount it.\nBefore any work could start on the painting, its condition was documented using detailed photography and microscopy. At the same time, appropriate materials had to be prepared and sourced; from dyeing the new first lining paper to exactly the right shade and tone, to finding matching old silks to repair all the missing areas. Mrs Qiu donated a Ming dynasty silk, which matched very closely the colour and weave of the painting, from her own collection (which was passed down to her by her scroll mounting teacher in Shanghai).\nStrengthening pigments with nikawa (a traditional East Asian consolidant)\nAfter consolidating any vulnerable pigments, the treatment could begin. The old unsuitable mount was removed from the painting, and in the process of doing so, wider hidden painted edges and more of a seal were revealed. The painting was then \u2018washed\u2019 four times in a wet treatment that removes acidity and discolouration from the silk. This process involves carefully sprinkling water onto the surface of the painting before gently removing the excess.\nAfter cleaning, in order to stabilise the silk weave during the upcoming treatments, a temporary facing was applied to the painting\u2019s surface, now nicely flattened by the wet treatment. This facing is made of tong oil paper (a specially treated water-resistant paper) with further layers of xuan paper (a short-fibred paper used in all Chinese scroll mounting and much East Asian calligraphy and painting) applied on top for extra stability.\nMrs Qiu with her two assistants, Valentina Marabini and Carol Weiss, removing the painting\u2019s old backing papers\nWith the surface protected, the painting could be turned over and stuck to the table face-down to reveal many layers of backing papers. These were removed with tweezers, sometimes in long strips, sometimes fibre by fibre, along with old unsuitable silk repairs. Only now was the real extent of damage to the painting revealed, and while still damp, misaligned silk pieces were carefully realigned to their correct positions.\nMrs Qiu repairing the missing silk areas\nOnce dry, the process of silk repair could begin, being careful not to waste any of the precious ancient silk resources. Shaped patches of repair silk were adhered to the back of the missing areas and once dry any overlapping edges were carefully pared away. Because the painting was in such bad condition, this process alone took three conservators working for around six weeks.\nMrs Qiu with her assistants and Mr Chu Hao from Shanghai Museum, after the painting has been lined and its facings removed.\nIt was at this stage that Mr Chu Hao from Shanghai Museum joined the team to help apply the new lining papers. The first lining was dyed Chinese xuan paper, and the second, long-fibred Japanese usumino paper. Mrs Qiu developed this technique, which she thinks provides extra strength, after coming to the British Museum\u2019s Hirayama Studio, where our Chinese and Japanese expert scroll mounters work together \u2013 a wonderfully unique situation, and one of its kind here in Europe. After this double-layer of lining was applied to the painting using wheat starch paste, it could be turned over and the temporary facings removed. Then it was applied to a drying board to allow the process of toning the repairs to begin.\nMrs Qiu and Mr Chu Hao retouching the painting on the drying board.\nWith the conservation aspect of the treatment finished, the mounting work could begin. Mount silks were lined and dyed to best enhance the painting, before being cut into carefully proportioned rectangles that were adhered to the painting\u2019s edges to make an aesthetic border. Slender paper reinforcement strips were applied to the back of the lined painting wherever there was previously a crack or crease, and then the whole mounted painting was given a final backing of two layers of xuan paper with cover silk at the top (to protect the scroll once rolled). This was attached to the drying board for many months, before it was removed and the back burnished, producing a smooth finish ideal for a scroll that will be rolled up. Finally, wooden fittings including the top stave, bottom roller and roller knobs were attached, and the hanging braid and tying ribbon tied on to produce a finished hanging scroll.\nAnonymous, Portrait of an offical in front of the Beijing imperial palace, hanging scroll, ink and colours on silk, c. 1480-1580 (British Museum 1881,1210,0.87.CH). After conservation.\nFrom undertaking the first analysis to tying the final ribbon, the entire process took over a year, with other paintings worked on during the long periods of drying. The painting is now stable and can be rolled and unrolled for display without risk of damage; the silk has been cleaned and strengthened by the washing and repair processes and the entire painting has been flattened by its new lining. Details in the painting, previously hidden by stains or creases, are visible once more. A hundred or more years should pass before this painting will need to be remounted again, its journey of conservation and potential to be preserved never-ending while there are still expert scroll mounters to care for these works in the traditional Chinese style."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/loan-of-a-parthenon-sculpture-to-the-hermitage-a-marble-ambassador-of-a-european-ideal/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Loan of a Parthenon sculpture to the Hermitage", "author": "Neil MacGregor, Director of The British Museum", "timestamp": "2014-12-05 00:00:00", "text": "The British Museum is a museum of the world, for the world and nothing demonstrates this more than the loan of a Parthenon sculpture to the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg to celebrate its 250th anniversary.\n\nThe State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg\nThe British Museum opened its doors in 1759, just five years before the Hermitage.

The Trustees of the British Museum were set up by Parliament to hold their collection to benefit not only the citizens of Great Britain, but \u2018all studious and curious persons\u2019 everywhere. The Museum today is the most generous lender in the world, sending great Assyrian objects to China, Egyptian objects to India and Iranian objects to the United States \u2013 making a reality of the Enlightenment ideal that the greatest things in the world should be seen and studied, shared and enjoyed by as many people in as many countries as possible.\nThe Trustees have always believed that such loans must continue between museums in spite of political disagreements between governments. That is why in 2011 they lent the Cyrus Cylinder,\u00a0the document setting out the humane ideals of the ancient Persian Empire, to Tehran. It is a position energetically shared by our counterparts in Russia. Last year, the Hermitage lent the spectacular collection of paintings, formed by Sir Robert Walpole and sold to Catherine the Great, back to his country house, Houghton Hall, for the summer. Loans from Russian museums enriched the recent exhibition Ice Age art: arrival of the modern mind and the BP exhibition Vikings: life and legend both at the British Museum, and Malevich at Tate Modern earlier this year was an outstanding act of Russian generosity, enjoyed by thousands of visitors. Both Tate and the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts are in return lending works to the exhibition Francis Bacon and the Art of the Past which opens at the Hermitage this weekend.\nSo, when our colleagues at the Hermitage asked if we might also make an important loan to celebrate their 250th anniversary, the Trustees immediately answered yes.

The carved images range from symbolic scenes of royal achievements to scenes of conquest and hunting that all serve to glorify the Assyrian monarch.\nReception of Nineveh sculptures at the British Museum, The Illustrated London News 1852, p. 184. Etching and engraving.\nThe reliefs were acquired by the Museum in the late 1840s and 1850s as a result of the Treasury-sponsored archaeological expeditions of Sir Austen Henry Layard, who began his excavations at the North-West Palace of Ashurnasirpal at Nimrud in 1845. The first reliefs arrived in London in June 1847, followed soon by the monumental human-headed winged bulls. To accommodate them, the Assyrian galleries were created \u2013 between the Egyptian sculpture and Greek sculpture galleries \u2013 where they remain today.\nAs well as contributing to CyArk\u2019s archive of cultural heritage, the scans provide a fantastic resource that we can use to help people better understand and engage with these objects. The carved panels work like modern comic books, starting the story at one end and following it along the walls to the conclusion. They were designed as a narrative, to be \u2018read\u2019 by the king, court and visitors to the royal palaces. It is incredibly difficult to get a good sense of that narrative, or their scale or presence through still images or even video.\nWith the help of the 3D models created from the scans, we have the potential to develop interpretative media in the galleries, online and through mobile and wearable technology. There are many potential approaches, from delineating the carved scenes where the stone has deteriorated to reconstructing the original architectural scheme, complete with colour paint, and torch-lit ambience as they might have appeared to the Assyrians in their original setting. The video above shows an early trial developed by CyArk using scans from the Siege of Lachish reliefs in Room 10b.\nImaginative reconstruction of the interior of an Assyrian palace.

When the Assyrian reliefs first arrived in the Museum almost exactly 160 years ago, the latest imaging technology of the time \u2013 photography \u2013 was in its infancy. Interestingly, it grew up closely connected with the developing discipline of archaeology. Indeed, the main players in the early histories of archaeology, photography and philology (the study of language, but particularly the decipherment of ancient languages) moved in the same social and scholarly circles in London, meeting, corresponding and collaborating.\nThe early pioneer of photography William Henry Fox-Talbot was also fascinated with archaeology and convinced of the usefulness of his invention to museum and archaeological practices. He had visited the British Museum Trustees in 1843 to demonstrate his invention, but failed to persuade Charles Fellows, then excavating in Lycia, in what is now southern Turkey, to take the bulky and fragile equipment on his next expedition.\nBut by the 1850s, the equipment and processes were simpler, and interest at the Museum had grown. Edward Hawkins, Keeper of the Department of Antiquities, responsible for the Assyrian objects, was keen for photographs to be made of the growing collection of cuneiform tablets (arriving from Assyria at the same time as the reliefs) to help allow Edward Hincks, an Irish scholar and expert in cuneiform, and others (including Fox-Talbot himself) to translate them.\nCollotype print photograph of Roger Fenton, taken by an unknown photographer, c. 1860.(Photo: \u00a9 National Media Museum / Science & Society Picture Library 2003-5001/2/22878).\nHawkins talked to Lord Rosse, scientist and President of the Royal Society, and British Museum Trustee, and soon after the Trustees instructed the Museum to employ a photographer. The advice of another scientist, Charles Wheatstone, was sought. Wheatstone had invented stereoscopy, creating the first stereoscopic viewer in 1838 which created the illusion of 3D. This early model used illustrations, but photography provided a far more suitable medium. Wheatstone had been collaborating with the photographer Roger Fenton, and recommended him for the job.\nRoger Fenton, The Assyrian Gallery, British Museum. stereoscopic pair of photographs, c. 1850s.\nPart of Fenton\u2019s early work at the Museum was a series of stereoscopic photographs of galleries, which survive as part of Wheatstone\u2019s collection now in the archives of King\u2019s College, London.

(Photo: \u00a9 National Media Museum / Science & Society Picture Library 1937-4093.)\nAs well as experimenting with this new 3D technology in the galleries, Fenton also made photographs of the objects, as was his brief. Between 1853 and 1854 he systematically photographed the series of cuneiform tablets known as the Kuyunkjik Collection. One of Fenton\u2019s greatest challenges was lighting. He had a glass studio built on the roof of the Museum, based on his own studio in his home in North London. Portable objects such as the cuneiform tablets were brought there to be photographed. By May 1856, Fenton and his assistants had made more than 8,000 prints in the galleries and his rooftop studio.\nStanding in the gallery watching CyArk\u2019s scanners spinning and collecting millions of points of data, I reflected on how the British Museum and the Assyrian objects that so fascinated scholars and public alike in the late 19th century were once again the site of a new technology in its early years. Museum technologists have to make difficult decisions on what to adopt and when. Soon after the period discussed above, the British Museum\u2019s early interest in photography waned, likely mainly due to the high cost of the equipment and materials. Fenton\u2019s employment was ended in 1859, and many of his negatives were transferred to the South Kensington Museum, now the Victoria and Albert Museum, where they form part of the UK\u2019s national collection of the art of photography. But still, of course, that doesn\u2019t mean it never happened: 160 years on, and the British Museum now has over 1.2 million images of objects in the collection online.\nCyArk have enabled us to investigate the possibilities of 3D with a significant group of objects from the collection, and I am optimistic that this is just the beginning. It doesn\u2019t take much to imagine a time when 3D scans become the de facto method of recording objects in the collection. I believe that this project \u2013 and once again the Assyrian reliefs \u2013 are remembered as a key moment in that change."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/barlachs-hovering-angel-travels-to-london/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Barlach's hovering angel travels to London", "author": "Clarissa von Spee, Curator", "timestamp": "2014-11-06 00:00:00", "text": "\u2018Everything is packed and we are on our way now!\u2019 said a breathless voice on the phone, and it took me several seconds to realize that it was the chairman of the Ernst Barlach Stiftung G\u00fcstrow (Barlach Foundation).\nG\u00fcstrow Cathedral.

The Angel arrived two days later in London. Too large to fit into a lift, the bronze was carried by no less than 8 well-muscled Heavy Object Handlers to the exhibition space.\nG\u00fcstrow, also known as Barlachstadt (Barlach city), was the hometown of Ernst Barlach, a German expressionist sculptor, whose most important work is his floating, or hovering bronze figure (Der Schwebende) made in 1926 to commemorate the victims of the First World War. Barlach himself fought in this war and returned a pacifist.\nDer Schwebende (The Hovering), by Ernst Barlach, G\u00fcstrow Cathedral.\nBarlach\u2019s memorial is unusual and unique. Detached from earth and time, with folded arms and closed eyes, the hovering figure expresses an internalized vision of the grief and sufferings of war. When the Nazis came to power in the 1930s, Barlach\u2019s works were among the first to be declared Entartete Kunst (\u2018degenerate art\u2019) and confiscated and removed from public display. Sadly, Barlach died in 1938, knowing that his masterwork had been taken down to be melted and probably made into war munitions.\nHowever, some courageous friends had managed to hide a second cast, which was then hung in the Antoniter Church in Cologne after the end of the Second World War. This time, the sculpture commemorated two World Wars. During the time of the Cold War in the 1950s, the parish of Cologne made another cast of the Angel and presented it in a gesture of friendship to the parish of G\u00fcstrow cathedral. For the next few months this cast is displayed in the British Museum\u2019s exhibition.\nIn 1981 Helmut Schmidt, the Chancellor of West Germany, met Erich Honecker in East Germany, and they visited Barlach\u2019s Angel in G\u00fcstrow cathedral.\u00a0On this occasion, Schmidt said to the bishop in G\u00fcstrow: \u2018I would like to thank you very much for your kind words of welcome. As you said, Barlach is indeed part of our common memory of the past. May I add, that Barlach could also stand as a representative of our shared and common future.\u2019 Schmidt was right. Eight years later, in peaceful demonstrations, East Germans brought the wall between East and West down.\nThe sculpture also holds an additional message for us. The British sculptor Antony Gormley said in a recent talk at the British Museum: \u2018If you want to know how it feels to exist beyond space and time, just close your eyes and look inwards.\u2019 Try it, it works! In the exhibition, Barlach\u2019s hovering bronze figure faces us directly, but its eyes are closed with arms folded over its chest. A perfect way to come to peace with the world."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/kathe-kollwitz-a-berlin-story/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "K\u00e4the Kollwitz, a Berlin story", "author": "Frances Carey", "timestamp": "2014-10-28 00:00:00", "text": "The seated figure of an elderly woman cast in bronze presides over a square in a part of north east Berlin known as Kollwitzkiez, the \u2018Kollwitz district\u2019, where K\u00e4the Schmidt (1867-1945) came to live in 1891 on her marriage to Dr Karl Kollwitz.

All the familiar signs of rising property values and gentrification were plain to see, much more so now: handsome, well-buffed apartment buildings, smart shops, caf\u00e9s such as Anne Blume (called after Kurt Schwitters\u2019s subversive poem of 1919), and nearby parks and playgrounds with brightly coloured equipment for children. TripAdvisor waxes lyrical about the area as a tourist destination.\nK\u00e4the Kollwitz, Selbstbildnis nach links (Self-portrait facing left), 1901, lithograph, 26.9 x 20.4 cm, British Museum 1951,0501.81, (\u00a9 DACS, 2014)\nIt is a far cry from the surroundings where K\u00e4the and Karl (d.1940) were to spend almost the whole of their adult lives. Prenzlauer Berg, the larger district in which Kollwitzkiez is situated, was developed as a working-class neighbourhood to cope with the great surge in population after 1871 when Berlin became the capital of a united Germany; by 1900 the population had grown from around 800,000 to 1.9 million. Street after street of Mietskasernen or tenements (literally \u2018rental barracks\u2019) were built where conditions were dire. The Frauenkunstverband (Organisation of Women Artists), co-founded by K\u00e4the Kollwitz in 1913, protested that 600,000 Berliners lived in dwellings with five or more people to a room while 100,000 children had nowhere to play. The title of the polemic by Werner Hegemann published in 1930, Das steinerne Berlin: Geschichte der gr\u00f6ssten Mietskasernenstadt der Welt (Stony Berlin: History of the Largest Tenement City in the World) captures the impact of this remorseless urbanization. Prenzlauer Berg was dominated by these tenements and the breweries that were the major employers.\nK\u00e4the Kollwitz, Arbeitslosigkeit (Unemployment) 1909, 6th state, etching and engraving 382 x 530 mm. \u00a9 DACS 2014 (1949,0411.3945)\nKollwitz was rooted in the nineteenth century, drawing much of her inspiration from the narrative realism and emotive power of writers such as Dickens, Ibsen and Zola. She grafted her reading of fiction, whether it dealt with near contemporary circumstances or ostensibly historical ones, onto the direct experience of \u2018the lives of others\u2019 who were beset by the uncertainties of casual employment, deprivation, high maternal and child mortality, and often domestic violence. In this challenging environment she found a beauty and a grandeur that became her mainspring as an artist. It was a largely black-and-white world, but with many gradations of tone and texture. For the realization of its expressive potential she turned to drawing and printmaking, above all to the example of Max Klinger (1857-1920) and his championing of graphic art as having an important status of its own. His series of ten etchings and aquatints called Dramen, Opus IX (1883) comprised six tragedies set in Berlin among the different echelons of society. Two dramas \u2013 Eine Mutter (A Mother) and M\u00e4rztage (March Days) \u2013 unfold over three plates each, while the other four have just a single sheet apiece. M\u00e4rztage seemed to refer to the failed liberal revolution of March 1848, but Klinger made it clear that he had in mind the contemporary context of Germany\u2019s Social Democratic movement in 1883.\nMax Klinger, Eine Mutter I (A Mother I), Dramen, Opus IX 1883, etching and aquatint, 453 x 318 mm (1981,1107.23)\nMax Klinger, M\u00e2rztage I (March Days I), Dramen, Opus IX 1883, etching and aquatint, 453 x 358 mm (1981,1107.28)\nK\u00e4the Kollwitz was similarly inspired by Gerhart Hauptmann\u2019s play Die Weber (The Weavers, 1892), which she saw at its first performance in 1893, to create a print series that was more about the conditions of the poor around her, than Silesia in 1844. Her second graphic cycle Der Bauernkrieg (Peasants\u2019 War) executed from 1902-7 and published the year after, used the religious and economic conflict of 1524-5 as yet another vehicle through which to express the heroism of the working class. This series along with her later work after the First World War in woodcut and lithography, earned her significant influence on the development of printmaking in Russia and China in the 1920s-40s and beyond.\nWithin a few years of commencing printmaking in 1890-91 K\u00e4the Kollwitz had demonstrated considerable artistry and technical competence. Ein Weberaufstand (A Weavers\u2019 Revolt) \u2013 three etchings and three lithographs completed in 1897 \u2013 propelled her to the front rank of artists in Germany. When she went to Paris in 1904 she was given a glowing testimonial for Rodin from Hugo von Tschudi, Director of the Berlin Nationalgalerie. Her greatest champion was Max Lehrs, Director of the Dresden Print Room who both acquired her work for the collection and published the first catalogue of her prints in 1902. He likewise encouraged a curator, later Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, Campbell Dodgson (1867-1948). Dodgson bequeathed to the British Museum (which was not then permitted to buy the work of living artists) a remarkably fine body of impressions from the most innovative phase of Kollwitz\u2019s career: none more so than a sequence of three states of the harrowing subject of Frau mit totem Kind (Woman with dead Child) of 1903, which shows Kollwitz\u2019s mastery in every aspect of its accomplishment. The artist and her younger son Peter (b.1896) were the models at a time when her elder son Hans (b.1892) had narrowly escaped dying of diphtheria. The sculptural quality of her treatment of the motif anticipates her later interest in working with a three-dimensional medium which was one of her objects of study in Paris.\nK\u00e4the Kollwitz, Frau mit totem Kind (Woman with dead child) 1903, 7th state, soft-ground etching and engraving with green and gold wash, 415 x 480 mm. \u00a9 DACS 2014 (1949,0411.3928)\nFrau mit totem Kind has none of the resignation of her later sculpture (1937) of a mother and her dead son, \u2018something like a Pi\u00e9ta\u2019, of which the artist said \u2018There is no longer pain, only reflection.\u2019 In the 1903 print there is only pain, but however much she drew upon personal experience and observation, it is nonetheless a carefully contrived artistic composition.\nK\u00e4the Kollwitz, Selbstbildnis (Self-portrait) 1924, 6th state, woodcut, 209 x 301 mm \u00a9 DACS, 2014 (1980,0126.85)\nKollwitz\u2019s most unwavering commitment was to being an artist: \u2018It alone is always stimulating, rejuvenating, exciting and satisfying.\u2019 (New Year\u2019s Day, 1912). Her intensely examined life as expressed in all her work, not just the many self-portraits, her journals and correspondence, is humbling to recall amidst the middle-class comforts of modern Kollwitzkiez. I admire her because she succeeded in doing what a great contemporary artist has advocated: \u2018I thought women as artists should focus on how to start, lead, and sustain a creative life. It\u2019s not a question of style or a break with tradition.\u2019 (Bridget Riley, 2004)."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-holy-roman-empire-from-charlemagne-to-napoleon/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "The Holy Roman Empire: from Charlemagne to Napoleon", "author": "Joachim Whaley, Professor of German History and Thought, University of Cambridge", "timestamp": "2014-10-13 00:00:00", "text": "The object labelled Charlemagne\u2019s crown in the British Museum\u2019s exhibition Germany: memories of a nation reminds us of a long history that ended over a century before the Third Reich began, but which nonetheless continues to shape Germany and German-speaking Europe even today. Like the polity which it recalls, the crown has a complex history. The object itself is a replica made in 1913 of the imperial crown which was once kept in Nuremberg and has been in Vienna since 1796. This crown almost certainly originated around AD 960, made by a Lower Rhineland workshop, perhaps in Cologne. Whether Charlemagne himself was actually crowned is unclear and while we know that he crowned his son at Aachen in 813 we do not know what crown was used.\nReplica crown of the Holy Roman Empire, 1913. (Photo: \u00a9 Anne Gold, St\u00e4dtische Museen for the City Hall, Aachen)\nEven so, the crown has come to stand for the Holy Roman Empire which originated in Charlemagne\u2019s Frankish realm, which comprised much of what we know as France and Germany. It was in the eastern part of this kingdom that a German monarchy became established in the 9th and 10th centuries. The legitimacy and special status of this monarchy derived substantially from its presumed descent from Charlemagne and from the inheritance of his role as protector of the papacy and guardian of the Church. This was implicit in the title Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, as the German polity formally became known around 1500.\nGold solidus of Emperor Charlemagne. France, AD 768-814\nThe special nature of the empire was also reflected in its election and coronation procedures. German rulers were elected as kings by their German peers. They were crowned at Aachen and then again at Rome by the pope. The first made them German kings; the second made them Roman emperors. The place of coronation moved to Frankfurt in the sixteenth century and the Roman coronation was discontinued. The German king now assumed the title of \u2018elected Roman emperor\u2019 when he was crowned at Frankfurt, which reflected a more distant relationship with the papacy in the early modern period.\nFrom the outset the German monarchy inherited the interest in Italy that Charlemagne had developed by virtue of his protectorate over the papacy. In the time of the Hohenstaufen dynasty from 1138 to 1254 this became an overriding obsession and Frederick II even lived exclusively in Sicily and southern Italy. Thereafter, however, the significance of Italy for the empire declined, though Tuscany, Modena, Parma, Milan and Savoy remained fiefdoms of the emperors until the nineteenth century.\nThe main territories of the empire were German, and these were the only ones that came to have votes in the assemblies of prince and cities, known as the Reichstag or imperial diet from the fifteenth century. They included bishops and other ecclesiastical dignitaries, secular princes and free cities, all of whom enjoyed significant independence in the regulation of their domestic affairs within the framework of the empire. At first they were subject only to their feudal obligations to the emperor, and later to legislation agreed by them at the diet.\nThe most important fiefs were those ecclesiastical and secular princes who actually elected the kings and emperors. In 1356 the Golden Bull, which codified the election arrangements in a fundamental law that remained valid until 1806, formally designated seven princes as electors. They enjoyed particular prestige but their rights were otherwise identical to those of the other princes and by the imperial cities.\nThe elective system and the retention of significant rights by the German princes and towns, often referred to as the \u2018old German liberty\u2019, meant that the German polity developed as a vast decentralised federation. Despite having a designated place of coronation, it never had a capital city. The imperial diet came to be held at the free city of Regensburg and other key institutions were located at Wetzlar, Vienna and elsewhere. This ensured the survival of a proliferation of courts and cities which each sponsored culture and the arts; first the visual arts, architecture and literature, then music as well. But in the later Middle Ages it also led to disorder and lawlessness.\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer, Portrait of Emperor Maximilian I, wearing the collar of the Golden Fleece over a brocaded mantle, and a fur-trimmed hat with an oval medallion of the Virgin and Child attached to the brim. Woodcut, 1518.\nThe solution to the inner instability of the empire in the fifteenth century came in the form of a series of agreements reached in the reign of Maximilian I (1493-1519). These set up a supreme court to resolve disputes and a series of regional organisations to implement its decisions. The assemblies of the princes and cities now also formally became the Reichstag (diet), which was designated co-ruler of the empire alongside the emperor.\nNo sooner established, this system was challenged by the Reformation. The church reform movement which swept through the empire following Luther\u2019s rejection of papal authority in 1517 represented an acute threat to stability. Charles V (1519-1556) wanted to stamp out Lutheranism, but many princes saw this as an infringement of their rights. Indeed many viewed the Lutheran reform movement as a welcome opportunity to reform the church in their lands and to extend their authority over them. Since the Reichstag could not agree, it was decided in 1526 that each prince or city should have the right to determine whether they embraced reform or remained loyal to the Catholic Church. Despite many subsequent disputes, some of them escalating into military conflict, this principle remained fundamental to the empire until 1806.\nThe last attempt by an emperor \u2013 Ferdinand II (1619-37) \u2013 to reassert Catholicism in the empire precipitated the Thirty Years War. He failed to achieve his ambition and in 1648 the Peace of Westphalia reaffirmed the rights of the princes and cities and affirmed Catholicism, Lutheranism and Calvinism as the three equally privileged confessions of the empire. It also added safeguards for the rights of subjects who did not share the official faith of the territory in which they lived.\nBronze medal with portraits of Charlemagne and Napoleon, designed by Bertrand Andrieu, 1806\nAs a system which both guaranteed the liberties of the princes and cities and secured the rights of their subjects the Holy Roman Empire existed until it was destroyed by Napoleon. It remains the longest lived political system in German history. And it was unquestionably better than many that succeeded it."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/one-night-at-the-museum-moving-durers-paper-triumph/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "One night at the Museum: moving D\u00fcrer's paper triumph", "author": "Joanna Kosek, Conservator, Prints and Drawings", "timestamp": "2014-09-12 00:00:00", "text": "Once the final visitor had departed from the Museum on Monday 14 July 2014 at 5.30pm a sizable team of specialists consisting of heavy-object handlers; exhibition designers, curators, conservators and photographers assembled in Room 12a in front of the world-famous woodcut of the Triumphal Arch by Albrecht D\u00fcrer (1471\u20131528).\nPreparing for the move.\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer, The Triumphal Arch. 1515-1517, Paper, woodcut, H: 357 cm, W: 295 cm, British Museum E,5.1.\nOne of the largest prints ever produced, this fantastic arch on paper was commissioned by the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I (r. 1486\u20131519) to rival the arches of the ancient Roman Emperors as his own propaganda piece. Unlike the stone forerunners of antiquity, his print came in multiple copies out of D\u00fcrer\u2019s workshop for distribution throughout the Holy Roman Empire. The giant print measures nearly 4 x 3 metres and was originally printed from 195 separate woodblocks. The copy in the British Museum\u2019s collection arrived in 1834, and was eventually housed in its current enormous metal frame in the 1970s.\nNow it was needed to be the star in the new Asahi Shimbun Display D\u00fcrer\u2019s Paper Triumph: the arch of the Emperor Maximilian in Room 3. Our task that night was to take it out of the frame and remove the glass in preparation for its move across the Museum.

All we knew for certain was that the whole thing was extremely solidly made and incredibly heavy.\nThe glass taped up and the print in the process of being detached from the wall.\nThis operation was preceded by months of planning and generated the fattest risk assessment folder ever seen. We began by taping the glass using the toughest tapes in the building, after which we had to lift the frame from the wall. This turned out to be fixed to large steel brackets bolted to the gallery wall and must have weighed nearly half a tonne. This first operation took at least four hours and we all held our breath until the frame, ingeniously, was raised and detached by a large lifting frame, normally used by the National Gallery to take their largest altarpieces off display and kindly lent to us for the job.\nRemoving steel frame components\nWe could then dismantle the frame into four separate components. Once this was done we could assess the construction of the mount and backing. It was at this stage that we also realised that we were dealing with 10mm thick plate glass weighing about 150kg in total.\nIt took some four hours of carefully considered steps before, at around 3am, the glass was finally separated from the print with full precision and total control. The print, escaped from the green-tinted glass, turned out to be a beautiful impression on choice early 16th-century paper.\nPlate glass detached from the print.\nPlate glass swivelled to lay flat on the floor.\nAt last D\u00fcrer\u2019s masterpiece could be fixed to a temporary aluminium support frame and screwed onto the wall without the threat of the glass breaking.

(Photo: (c) The Trustees of the British Museum)\nThere are over a thousand terracotta objects from Ur in the British Museum\u2019s collection, primarily reliefs, figurines and models. Although some are skilfully modelled, the majority are rather crude and mass-produced in moulds. My initial task was to assess each one, selecting those that needed treatment and completing the work before they could be handled and photographed. In the image above, you can see me assessing the condition of one of the important objects from Ur, the fired clay mask of Humbaba, a fearsome monster slain by Gilgamesh in Mesopotamian literature. During the process, colleagues from ceramics and glass conservation joined me to complete the assessment work on the objects, while I undertook the actual conservation treatments.\nFollowing the terracotta objects, I assessed the condition of the pottery from Ur. This large collection comprises over a thousand ceramic vessels in various sizes, shapes, colours and fabrics. This was a huge challenge! Every day, my colleague Gareth Brereton and I went to one of British Museum\u2019s storage areas where the pottery from Ur is housed. We set up a small working area in this room for object assessments, photography and registration. There were a large number of cupboards to go through, so Gareth and I worked almost every morning together, assessing the condition of each pot so that Gareth could handle, photograph and register them. We had plenty of exercise going up and down the ladder each morning as some of the objects were stored very high up in the shelves.\nMost terracotta objects and ceramic vessels from Ur are in good condition. They sometimes require conservation work, since they have unstable fragments, flakes or cracks on their surfaces. This is very normal due to the age of the objects, most are which are about 4,000 years old. It is crucial that the necessary treatments are undertaken. When unstable objects are not treated using proper conservation techniques and materials, further problems may occur during storage and handling, such as loss of surfaces and decoration, cracks, breakage of fragments that can make it difficult to study and learn more from the objects.\nStabilising the surface of a large ceramic vessel from Ur\nI identify any cracks and/or unstable flakes on the surface of the vessels before stabilising them using conservation grade materials. I often use a fine brush or a micropipette for this work. Once the treatment is completed, I enter all my treatment records onto the British Museum\u2019s curatorial database, Merlin, so that the information is accessible across the Museum and the world via the collection online.\nAssessing a cuneiform tablet from Ur\nI have also been assessing and undertaking conservation on the cuneiform tablets from Ur. It is particularly important to prevent the loss of surfaces from tablets, because that would mean loss of the text.\nApart from undertaking remedial \u2018hands on\u2019 work with objects, I am also responsible from supporting the Ur team when they have any questions about handling the objects safely, as some are very fragile. I also monitor the environmental conditions in the Ur project lab and storage cupboards, using digital sensors which we place in different areas. This is important because fluctuating temperature and relative humidity can severely damage archaeological objects. For example, soluble salts in the ceramic and clay fabrics can react very quickly with the fluctuating conditions, resulting in delamination and loss of object surfaces, which can contain elaborate decorations, pigments and reliefs.\nWhen I have completed the conservation work on the pottery and the cuneiform tablets, I will move on to the conservation of other types of objects and materials from Ur, in order to prepare them for digitisation and further study.

The overall form of the \u2013 very colourful \u2013 glass objects resembles that of mushroom- or papyrus-shaped ear-studs, frequently found in New Kingdom contexts, with a large number coming from Amarna and depicted on tomb scenes and mummy cartonnages. However, what struck me as unusual was that all the examples in the British Museum have a small hole running through the centre of the object. Although scholars refer to these items as \u2018ear-studs\u2019 or \u2018ear-plugs\u2019, publications from over a century ago, including some by Sir Flinders Petrie and bead specialist Horace C. Beck, call them beads or amulets, because of this piercing.\nThe glass objects laid out during the documentation process\nThe objects were produced by wrapping molten glass rods around a metal rod; however, this procedure would not have necessitated a complete piercing. Scholars have suggested that the frontal hole, which would be visible if these items were worn through a pierced ear-lobe, may have accommodated a fresh flower. While this is conceivable, I would rather interpret these items as beads, since most of them have a spiral-decorated shaft. This shaft would be invisible when worn through the ear-lobe. The beads could have been threaded horizontally or vertically, worn in collars or on the ends of wigs.\nUnfortunately, there is no pictorial nor three-dimensional evidence for how these objects were worn, nor do the archaeological contexts tell us much about their use. Most have been found individually, rather than in pairs, and those that appear on the art market and in private collections are usually without provenance (i.e. information about the context in which they were originally excavated or found). This shows that we must be cautious with how objects are designated, because they may be based on conjecture rather than evidence.\nMy time in the British Museum has allowed the updating of nearly 240 records of items of glass jewellery of the New Kingdom with full descriptions and measurements, and full photographic documentation, accessible to all through the Museum\u2019s Collection online."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/ur-of-the-chaldees-a-virtual-vision-of-woolleys-excavations/", "category": "Uncategorized", "title": "Ur of the Chaldees: a virtual vision of Woolley\u2019s excavations", "author": "Birger Helgestad, Project Curator, Ur Project", "timestamp": "2014-07-22 00:00:00", "text": "I am responsible for managing the digitisation of objects and archives for the Ur Project, a dynamic new collaboration between the British Museum and Penn Museum made possible with the lead support of the Leon Levy Foundation.

These unique finds provide crucial information about third-millennium society, as well as the warfare, music, food, drink, and customs of the period. We can also learn much about the people that lived and died in this city through the study of the cuneiform tablets excavated at the site.

Not only will the collections from the three museums (the British Museum, Penn Museum and the Iraq Museum) be integrated, but also the different categories of object brought together in one virtual space, and, crucially, barriers between object data and archives will be broken down.\nA Sumerian schoolboy\u2019s practice tablet with proverbs on one side and rough workings from a maths lesson on the back (multiple views).

This approach will also allow us to re-establish lost object identifications and crucial findspot information. We will relate internal references between notes, letters, publications and catalogues, connect artefacts to their findspots on maps, and link wherever possible to other resources with the goal of enabling researchers to analyse the site in exciting new ways.

This has also given us the opportunity to integrate some of the recent research into the early, formative periods of Egyptian civilisation and present our better understanding of it.\nAncient Egyptian civilisation is the product of more than 5,000 years of development. The gallery focuses on the earliest, prehistoric, phases of this development from 8600 BC to 3100 BC when Egypt unified to become the world\u2019s first nation state. It also highlights the advances in ideology and technology during the First and Second Dynasty that paved the way for the Pyramid Age of the Old Kingdom. To illustrate these stories we have created new displays of objects long held in the collection as well as a selection of materials only recently acquired.\nExcavations at Jebel Sahaba, 1965 (Photo: Wendorf Archive, British Museum)\nMap of cemetery 117 at Jebel Sahaba. The red dots indicate those who experienced a violent death. Click on the image to view a larger version.\nAmong the most exciting of the new acquisitions are the materials from the site of Jebel Sahaba, now in northern Sudan, which were donated to the Museum by Dr Fred Wendorf in 2002. Excavating here in 1965\u201366, as part of the UNESCO-funded campaign to salvage sites destined to be flooded by the construction of the Aswan High Dam, Dr Wendorf found a cemetery (site 117) containing at least 61 individuals dating back to about 13,000 years ago. This discovery was of great significance for two reasons. First, as a designated graveyard, evidently used over several generations, it is one of the earliest formal cemeteries in the world. Prior to this discovery, only isolated graves, or clusters of up to three bodies had been known within the Nile Valley. But perhaps even more significant, of the 61 men, women and children buried at Jebel Sahaba, at least 45% of them died of inflicted wounds, making this the earliest evidence for inter-communal violence in the archaeological record. Chips and flakes of chert, the remnants of arrows or other weapons, were found mixed with and in some cases still embedded in the bones of 26 individuals, while cut marks were found on the bones of others.\nExcavation photo of the two victims of violence featured in Room 64 (burials 20 and 21). The pencils point to weapon fragments mixed with the bones.

This is the first time these skeletons have ever been publicly shown. Both were adult men, buried together in the standard flexed position, on their left side, on their left side, head east, facing south. A total of 19 weapon fragments were found in and among the bones of Burial 21 by the original excavators, including one still lodged in his pelvis. However, modern conservation of the bodies in preparation for the display has now made it possible to see at high magnification many more tiny chips. Ongoing research is also studying the velocity and directionality of the arrows and weapons based on cut marks and other micro-traces on the bones, potentially allowing us to recreate the lethal raid. Clearly, the conflict was brutal and seems to have been fairly constant, as healed injuries have also been observed.\nThe reasons for all of this violence most likely comes down to climate. The Ice Age glaciers covering much of Europe and North America at this time made the climate in Egypt and Sudan cold and arid. The only place to go was to the Nile, but its regime was erratic: depending on the exact dating, the river was either high and wild, or low and sluggish. Either way, there was little viable land on which to live, and resources must have been scarce. Competition for food may well have been the reason for the conflict as more groups clustered around the best fishing and gathering grounds and were unwilling or unable to move away. Two other cemeteries found by Dr Wendorf in the vicinity suggest that several other social units, or small tribes, also considered this area their home and this may have caused friction. However, the bodies in the other cemeteries show no evidence for the sustained violence seen in Cemetery 117, suggesting that this group was either very unlucky or that the cemetery was allocated specifically for those who died a violent death. As more research is carried out on the unique collection now housed in the Museum, we will certainly learn more about life in those precarious times.\nThe Battlefield Palette. 3100 BC, Abydos, Egypt.

The newly refurbished gallery also features the return of the popular virtual autopsy table allowing a deeper look into Gebelein Man and his unfortunate end. For the actual remains of this remarkably well preserved natural mummy, the new display aims to recreate his grave as accurately as the surviving records allow. Sir Wallis Budge, Keeper of the Egyptian Department from 1894 to 1924, claims to have witnessed the excavation of Gebelein Man in 1899 and relates that the grave was covered by stone slabs and the body was surrounded by pots and other objects. Simulating some stone slabs was no problem, but it proved impossible to determine which items came specifically from his grave. Those now accompanying him do at least come from Gebelein and date to about 3500 BC, the time we think that Gebelein Man lived. This was a period when several regional centres were beginning to vie for power and territory, leading ultimately to the unification of Egypt some 400 years later. Violence no doubt played a role in this process (as made clear by the intricately carved Battlefield palette, soon to be reunited with its mending piece on long term loan from the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) and the stab wound in Gebelein Man\u2019s back may mark him as an unfortunate victim of his times.\nCatering for the royal afterlife, board games and playing pieces for Mehen, the snake game, were some of the objects placed in the tombs of the First Dynasty kings.\u00a0Ivory gaming piece.

Other themes in the gallery include how climate change has preserved for us a glimpse at the very beginnings of ancient Egyptian civilisation in the lives of herders living in what is now the Sahara desert from about 8600 BC until the drying climate forced them to the Nile. There they adopted farming, setting in motion the social and technological developments that led directly to the advent of Dynastic Egyptian civilisation in around 3100 BC. The gallery includes displays illustrating afterlife beliefs, early gods, the first writing and technological innovations, as well as a look at the sumptuous afterlife of the First Dynasty kings.\nCeramic mask recently found at Hierakonpolis, displayed in cast in Room 64, courtesy of the Hierakonpolis Expedition.\nWorking on the gallery, through the kindness of Tom and Linda Heagy, I have also been able to integrate some of the recent discoveries (in pictures and casts) from the British Museum-sponsored excavations at the site of Hierakonpolis, a major site of the formative predynastic period. Findings there are helping to chart the development of some of the characteristics that came to typify ancient Egyptian civilisation. Current research at other early sites also feature, thanks to the cooperation of many colleagues, too numerous to name, who so kindly supplied information and photographs, often at short notice. Through the display, I hope visitors will gain a better understanding of Egypt at its origin \u2013 a fascinating laboratory of dynamic experimentation \u2013 and the debt that the Egyptians of later times owed to their early ancestors.\nCorrection: The post was edited on 7 August 2014 to correct an error in the description of the position of Burials 20 and 21 in paragraph 4.

For human remains, it\u2019s even more complicated because there are additional questions of care and respect for the dead that have to be carefully considered before any research can be done. However, by studying their remains we can find out an enormous amount about the people of the past; about their health, their diet and about the religious practices they carried out.\nThe Jericho skull shown with face forwards. The eyes are made from shell. \u00a08200-7500 BC, British Museum\u00a01954,0215.1. (Photo (c) The Trustees of the British Museum)\nThe so-called Jericho skull is among the oldest human remains in the British Museum collection. Thought to be between 8,500 and 9,300 years old, it is one of seven Neolithic plastered human skulls found together by Kathleen Kenyon during excavations at Jericho in 1953. The site is now located in the modern State of Palestine.\nPlastered skulls are thought to have been an important part of Neolithic rituals involving the removal, decoration and collecting of skulls. There has been a lot of debate about why particular skulls were chosen for this. Some archaeologists link them to the worship of elder males. Others suggest they were selected according to their shape or the status of the person in society. Some argue that they are portraits of revered members of the community. None of these theories are completely convincing, but a general agreement has emerged that the worship of ancestors may be involved.\nThe Jericho skull shown facing sideways. The lips and remaining ear are modelled in plaster.\nView of the back of the skull showing the hole made in the bone and the plaster base.\nThis \u2018skull\u2019 is actually a cranium because the lower jaw has been removed. There is also a section of bone missing on the left side towards the back where the soil filling inside can be seen. The cranium was decorated with a thick layer of plaster, shaped to look like a human face, which covers all of the upper jaw and finishes at the eye sockets and temples. Plaster has also been used on the base, so the skull sits upright on its own. Frustratingly, the plaster covers the parts of the skull which provide clues about who the person was and what happened to them. Therefore, over 50 years after it had been found, we still knew very little about the person whose skull this was. Physical anthropologists (experts in the human body) Theya Molleson (Scientific Associate, Natural History Museum) and Jessica Pearson, looked at how much the sutures (the joins between the skull\u2019s bones) had closed and were able to suggest that it was a mature adult, but we needed to see beneath the plaster to find out more.\nThe Jericho skull in the radiography laboratory. The grey cassette behind the skull contains the X-ray film.\nThe Museum has equipment for taking X-rays (radiographs) and my colleague Janet Ambers was able to X-ray the Jericho skull, but the soil filling the skull made it difficult to see everything inside clearly. We were therefore very lucky to be offered the chance to use a micro-CT scanner and its associated software by the Imaging and Analysis Centre, at the Natural History Museum, and the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College, and to work with two of their experts, Richard Able and Crispin Wiles.\nThe images created by the CT scans allowed us to look beneath the surface, revealing new details about the person that died so long ago. The scans confirmed that the skull had belonged to a mature adult who was more likely to have been male than female. We were also able to look at his upper jaw, where we found broken teeth, tooth decay and damage done to the bone by abscesses; all of which fitted well with the person being a mature adult. The back teeth (second and third molars) never developed and the second incisor on the right side is also missing. It is difficult to be sure without other examples to look at, but these teeth may have failed to grow because of inherited traits that are relatively rare.\nThe scans also allowed us see that the shape of the person\u2019s head had been changed during their lifetime. It is possible to alter the shape of a skull by binding or bandaging the head during childhood. When we looked at the outside of the Jericho Skull we could see a slight dip in the surface running over the top of the head from ear to ear which suggested that something like this had been carried out. The X-rays and the CT scans, showed changes in the thickness of the skull bone and, as such alterations can only be made while bone is forming and growing, this must have happened from an early age.\nThis work has also revealed new details about how the skull was prepared for plastering. The CT scans showed concentric rings of grits within the soil and a ball of finer clay sealing the access hole at the back. This suggests that the soil was deliberately put inside the skull to support the surface as the plaster face was being added. It is possible that the round piece of bone cut away to form the access hole was originally put back after the cranium had been filled. Although it was subsequently lost, its earlier presence may explain why the soft soil filling has survived so well.\nThe work has significantly changed our knowledge of how this person\u2019s skull was treated both during life and after death, making clear the benefits of the long-term care for human remains offered by museums. This previously enigmatic individual is now known to be a old man who suffered badly from toothache. The deliberate re-shaping of the skull also suggests that for this individual, physical change and social status may have been linked, something seen across the history of humankind. The use of imaging techniques has provided us with new areas of investigation and suggested new ways to view plastered skulls; as a reflection of an individual\u2019s life rather than just a treatment for the dead."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/tattoos-in-ancient-egypt-and-sudan/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Tattoos in ancient Egypt and Sudan", "author": "Marie Vandenbeusch, Project Curator, Ancient Egypt and Sudan", "timestamp": "2014-06-26 00:00:00", "text": "One of the eight mummies that are the subject of the exhibition Ancient lives, new discoveries, the mummy of a woman from Sudan, was discovered relatively recently, compared to the others. Her body was found in 2005, during rescue excavations taking place in the area of the Fourth Nile Cataract, where the building of a dam threatened to flood archaeological sites. The collection of over a thousand human remains excavated during the mission was donated by the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (Sudan) to the Sudan Archaeological Research Society, which then gave them to the British Museum. Arid climate and hot sand had naturally mummified some of these bodies, including the remains of this woman. Her soft tissues are so well preserved that conservators at the British Museum located a tattoo and other marks on her skin.\nEvidence for tattooing in ancient Egypt and in Nubia is scarce, and human remains do not provide any indication of the frequency of the tattoos themselves: because of their location directly on the skin they are usually either not preserved or hidden by bandages. The first tangible examples of Egyptian tattoos date back to the Middle Kingdom (about 2000 BC): several tattooed mummies of women were found at Deir el-Bahari. The markings mainly consist of dots and dashes, often grouped into geometrical patterns, such as lozenges, and are usually placed on the chest, the abdomen, the arms or the legs.\nFaience statuette of a woman with body decoration which has sometimes been identified as tattoos.

RMN-Grand Palais / Christian Decamps)\nAlthough tattoos are rare on human remains, they seem to be more frequent on female representations. The geometrical decorations commonly adorning Middle Kingdom statuettes are very similar to tattoos found on the mummies of women who lived at the same period. However, the debate about their identification as tattoos is still open and recent discoveries regularly bring new insights to these questions.\nFaience wine bowl with female lute player.

(Photo: (c) National Museum of Antiquities)\nBoth human remains and decorated figurines take us to the world of dancers and musicians. One of the mummies from Deir el-Bahari is thought to be a priestess of the goddess Hathor, whose patronage of music and dance is well established. There are also depictions showing a figure of the god Bes on the thigh of young ladies who appear to be dancers and musicians. This is not surprising when we consider that Bes, a god who protected the household and the family, was also associated with music and dance. The implicit eroticism symbolised by Bes in connection with these naked dancers seems to be also conveyed by the presence of tattoos.\nTattoo depicting a monogram of Saint Michael on the inner thigh of the woman from Sudan\nAs is still the case today, the meaning and function of tattoos can vary, some showing affiliation to a social group, others having medical or protective purposes. The naturally mummified woman from Sudan in the exhibition bears a monogram of St Michael tattooed on her inner thigh. It combines in one symbol the letters forming the name Michael (MIXAH\u039b) in Greek or Coptic (both languages use a very similar alphabet). The monogram is topped with a cross. The tattoo suggests that the woman was of Christian faith, and may indicate that she hoped to place herself under the protection of the Archangel \u2013 one of the patron saints of Nubia.\nThe monogram of St Michael is already known in other contexts, in particular in Nubia where both the monogram and the representation of the Archangel were drawn on the walls of churches or incised on pottery, but its use as a tattoo was an unexpected discovery. We can interpret the tattoo as an invocation to the saint, but it was also a way of demonstrating one\u2019s faith. Tattoos are still used in this way by Copts who often bear a small cross inside the wrist as a spiritual symbol of their affiliation to a community."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/in-respect-of-the-dead-human-remains-in-the-british-museum/", "category": "Curator's corner", "title": "In respect of the dead: human remains in the British Museum", "author": "Alexandra Fletcher, Curator, Middle East Department", "timestamp": "2014-06-12 00:00:00", "text": "The most frequently asked question in the British Museum is almost certainly \u2018Where are the mummies?\u2019\nUnderstandably the collections of mummified human remains are a great source of fascination for visitors and the Egyptian galleries are always busy.

This is a controversial subject that has been debated for a long time and will continue to be discussed. There is no doubt that there have been, and will continue to be, huge benefits in having human remains available to study. The benefits of research however, must be set against the feelings of communities with strong connections to some of the human remains within museum collections. The British Museum has experienced several repatriation claims (see under related links on our Human Remains page), which are carefully considered on a case-by-case basis. Research using museum collections has been able to advance knowledge of the history of disease, epidemiology and human biology. It has also given valuable insight into different cultural approaches to death, burial and beliefs. This knowledge continues to grow as different techniques and approaches to such studies are developed and the total body of knowledge \u2013 within which comparisons can be made \u2013 expands.\nInside Room 62, Egyptian death and afterlife: mummies. The Roxie Walker Gallery\nDisplay of human remains, both physically within museum galleries and online, is an important part of sharing this information to the widest possible audience. This not only spreads knowledge but may also help to generate enthusiasm for learning about our past; hopefully for the benefit of future generations. Of course, display should be done with careful thought. There is no justification for the voyeuristic display of human remains simply as objects of morbid curiosity. As in storage, displays of human remains must acknowledge that the remains were once a living person and respect this fact. Human remains should not be displayed if they are not central to the information being conveyed and this has led to removal of some skeletal remains from British Museum galleries. Where possible, visitors should be able to avoid seeing human remains should they not wish to and the views of source communities should also be respected if they do not wish ancestral remains to be on public display.\nThere is no final word on such matters and no doubt the decisions made today will seem as out of step with current thinking in the future, as do decisions made by earlier generations of museum workers 50, 100 and in some cases 200 years ago. Looking after human remains in museums will therefore continue as a respectful balancing act across the boundaries of ethics, learning and access.\nIf you want to know more, a recent book, Regarding the Dead: Human Remains in the British Museum, discusses the ethical and practical issues associated with caring for human remains and presents some of the solutions the British Museum has sought to curation, storage, access and display.

The tapestry panel is applied on a linen plain weave, cut out when discovered at the end of the 19th century\nAs in many museums today, the British Museum\u2019s Egyptian textiles collection is mostly composed of fragmentary pieces, acquired through excavation and purchase in the late 19th and early 20th century. At that time, decorative elements considered as spectacular or aesthetically pleasing were often cut out from large pieces when discovered, as only the most vibrant and colourful pieces were wanted by European collectors. However, this meant that they were also cut off from their archaeological contexts. It was for this reason that, with the exception of two great sets of textiles from excavations at Qasr Ibrim and Wadi Sarga, we decided to reorder the Museum\u2019s collection not by provenance or date \u2013 as these are rarely known \u2013 but by technique. Indeed, a close visual examination of technique, and drawing on knowledge of their cultural background, allows us to determine the possible original function of many of the textiles, essentially fragments of garments and home furnishing originating from burial contexts.\nDetailed macro shot of a multi-coloured tapestry panel, depicting three stylized human figures. Egypt, 4th-7th century AD,\u00a0British Museum\u00a0EA 37131.\u00a0(Photo: (c) Trustees of the British Museum).\nWe began our audit by classifying the textiles by their primary weaving technique \u2013 tapestry, brocade, embroidery etc. This process helped us to work out how much storage space was required for each group, taking into account the fragility of the textiles, but also the need for easy access and the possibility of new items joining the collection at a later date. Each primary group was then sub-divided, on the basis of shape or iconography of the textiles.\nLate Antique Egyptian textiles re-housed in storage drawers after study, documentation and photography\nDrawer by drawer, the technical and iconographic analyses for each textile were completed by Amandine Merat, the curator responsible for the project. Some pieces had already been studied by Hero Granger-Taylor in the 1990s; in those cases, her detailed notes were checked and annotated where necessary. However, a great majority of the textiles had never been analysed before. For these, the fibres were identified, measurements were taken, techniques carefully analysed and a complete description of the piece and its iconography was made. Original function of the textiles and dating were re-attributed where necessary.\nOnce the technical information was recorded, the textiles were photographed by Emily Taylor. A general shot of front and back was taken, an arrow included to indicate the direction of the warp of the fabric. Detailed macro shots were then taken to record any small details or highlight interesting elements of design, use or technique. The textiles were then re-housed in acid free tissue, and melinex sleeves where possible, and then placed on Correx boards within their storage drawers to enable ease of handling.\nAmandine M\u00e9rat (front) and Ruiha Smalley (behind) recording technical analyses from a textile, in the AES Department organic store room.\nAll relevant information was recorded in a spreadsheet by our volunteer Ruiha Smalley, before being standardised and uploaded into the British Museum\u2019s collection database, through which it will soon be available to the public via the collection online."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/decoding-anglo-saxon-art/", "category": "Curator's corner", "title": "Decoding Anglo-Saxon art", "author": "Craig Williams, Illustrator and Rosie Weetch, Curator", "timestamp": "2014-05-28 00:00:00", "text": "One of the most enjoyable things about working with the British Museum\u2019s Anglo-Saxon collection is having the opportunity to study the intricate designs of the many brooches, buckles, and other pieces of decorative metalwork. This is because in Anglo-Saxon art there is always more than meets the eye.\nThe objects invite careful contemplation, and you can find yourself spending hours puzzling over their designs, finding new beasts and images. The dense animal patterns that cover many Anglo-Saxon objects are not just pretty decoration, they have multi-layered symbolic meanings and tell stories. Anglo-Saxons, who had a love of riddles and puzzles of all kinds, would have been able to \u2018read\u2019 the stories embedded in the decoration. But for us it is trickier as we are not fluent in the language of Anglo-Saxon art.\nAnglo-Saxon art went through many changes between the 5th and 11th centuries, but puzzles and storytelling remained central. The early art style of the Anglo-Saxon period is known as Style I and was popular in the late 5th and 6th centuries. It is characterised by what seems to be a dizzying jumble of animal limbs and face masks, which has led some scholars to describe the style as an \u2018animal salad\u2019. Close scrutiny shows that Style I is not as abstract as first appears, and through carefully following the decoration in stages we can unpick the details and begin to get a sense for what the design might mean.\nDecoding the square-headed brooch.\u00a0Click on the image for a larger version.\nOne of the most exquisite examples of Style I animal art is a silver-gilt square-headed brooch from a female grave on the Isle of Wight. Its surface is covered with at least 24 different beasts: a mix of birds\u2019 heads, human masks, animals and hybrids. Some of them are quite clear, like the faces in the circular lobes projecting from the bottom of the brooch. Others are harder to spot, such as the faces in profile that only emerge when the brooch is turned upside-down. Some of the images can be read in multiple ways, and this ambiguity is central to Style I art.\nTurning the brooch upside-down reveals four heads in profile on the rectangular head of the brooch, highlighted in purple. Click on the image for larger version.\nOnce we have identified the creatures on the brooch, we can begin to decode its meaning. In the lozenge-shaped field at the foot of the brooch is a bearded face with a helmet underneath two birds that may represent the Germanic god Woden/Odin with his two companion ravens. The image of a god alongside other powerful animals may have offered symbolic protection to the wearer like a talisman or amulet.\nGold belt buckle. Sutton Hoo, Suffolk, early 7th century AD. Click on the image for a larger version.\nStyle I was superseded by Style II in the late 6th century. This later style has more fluid and graceful animals, but these still writhe and interlace together and require patient untangling. The great gold buckle from Sutton Hoo is decorated in this style. From the thicket of interlace that fills the buckle\u2019s surface 13 different animals emerge. These animals are easier to spot: the ring-and-dot eyes, the birds\u2019 hooked beaks, and the four-toed feet of the animals are good starting points. At the tip of the buckle, two animals grip a small dog-like creature in their jaws and on the circular plate, two snakes intertwine and bite their own bodies. Such designs reveal the importance of the natural world, and it is likely that different animals were thought to hold different properties and characteristics that could be transferred to the objects they decorated. The fearsome snakes, with their shape-shifting qualities, demand respect and confer authority, and were suitable symbols for a buckle that adorned a high-status man, or even an Anglo-Saxon king.\nThe five senses on the Fuller Brooch. Anglo-Saxon, late 9th century AD. Click on the image for a larger version.\nAnimal art continued to be popular on Anglo-Saxon metalwork throughout the later period, when it went through further transformations into the Mercian Style (defined by sinuous animal interlace) in the 8th century and then into the lively Trewhiddle Style in the 9th century. Trewhiddle-style animals feature in the roundels of the Fuller Brooch, but all other aspects of its decoration are unique within Anglo-Saxon art. Again, through a careful unpicking of its complex imagery we can understand its visual messages. At the centre is a man with staring eyes holding two plants. Around him are four other men striking poses: one, with his hands behind his back, sniffs a leaf; another rubs his two hands together; the third holds his hand up to his ear; and the final one has his whole hand inserted into his mouth. Together these strange poses form the earliest personification of the five senses: Sight, Smell, Touch, Hearing, and Taste. Surrounding these central motifs are roundels depicting animals, humans, and plants that perhaps represent God\u2019s creation.\nThis iconography can best be understood in the context of the scholarly writings of King Alfred the Great (d. AD 899), which emphasised sight and the \u2018mind\u2019s eye\u2019 as the principal way in which wisdom was acquired along with the other senses. Given this connection, perhaps it was made at Alfred the Great\u2019s court workshop and designed to be worn by one of his courtiers?\nThroughout the period, the Anglo-Saxons expressed a love of riddles and puzzles in their metalwork.

But it seems to me that, just like the Vikings, the Vandals have suffered from a bad press. The surviving accounts of their sack of Rome in AD 455, of their further piratical raids around the Mediterranean, and of their persecution of the Catholic inhabitants of North Africa are all presented through the eyes of their enemies and opponents: the Roman and Byzantine Empires and the established Church. Clearly, the Vandals were regarded as the \u2018bad guys\u2019 of the day and we, too have been led into thinking of them as wild barbarians, intent on the destruction of Rome and its civilisation.\nCopper 42 nummi coin showing a Vandal warrior. Although it does not carry a king\u2019s name, it is possible that this coin was made during the time of Gelimer (AD 530-3), and thus he may be the intended identity of the cloaked figure with a spear. The reverse shows the mark of value in Roman numerals (including the long-tailed L (=50) typical of Latin inscriptions in Vandal Africa, and also seen on Gelimer\u2019s silver coinage).

We do not, after all, have the Vandal side of the story, although we should probably discount the suggestion that they were invited into North Africa, their final home, in support of the Roman governor. He may have been made a scapegoat later for the Vandal conquest of the region.\nIvory diptych of Stilicho (right) with his wife Serena and son Eucherius, aroud AD 395, Monza Cathedral, Italy. (Photo \u00a9 Iberfoto / SuperStock)\nOne Vandal by the name of Stilicho served in the West Roman army and even rose through the ranks to become its commanding general and the power behind the Imperial throne. He married Serena, a Roman citizen from a prominent family, and did his best to defend Italy and Rome from attack in this turbulent period. But, he was murdered in 408 on the orders of an emperor who was mistrustful of his ambition. There followed a brutal massacre of \u2018barbarian\u2019 women and children at the hands of Roman troops. Now, we might well wonder who the real barbarians were in these events.\nThe Vandals were originally a farming and cattle-herding people who had migrated from Central Europe to escape from outside pressure on their homeland, caused by the inroads of the nomadic Huns in the early 5th century. They eventually went on to conquer and settle in the Roman provinces of Africa, in what are parts of Tunisia and Algeria today, making their capital at Carthage in 439. But, we should not forget that they had been left with little choice \u2013 when military conflicts in the province of Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal) made the situation too dangerous to stay, it became a fight for survival. They had already spent around 30 years within the Roman Empire and must certainly have been impressed by its wealth and cultural achievements. They would have wanted to participate in its prosperity, not kill the goose that laid the golden egg.\nWe tend to forget that, whatever their origins, the Vandals had been previously converted to Christianity, adopting the Arian creed, which held sway at the time. It was only later that Arianism, which regarded Christ as secondary to God, was declared heretical by the Roman Catholic Church, with the unfortunate result of setting the Vandals in religious opposition to their subjects. This was not the first time, however, that there had been bitter religious strife in the region, as witnessed by the earlier disputes between Catholics and Donatists. Indeed, the latter, who made up a sizeable proportion of the population, may have welcomed a change of rule, according to one eminent historian.\nThe sack of Rome certainly did the Vandals no favours. Although their main aim was to seize treasures, they also took thousands of Romans captive. But, in spite of the political upheaval caused by the establishment of their kingdom, the region of North Africa that had fallen under their control remained prosperous and economically stable, even if at a reduced level. The Vandal kings minted coins of silver and bronze for trade, although this suffered to some extent following the decline of the market of Rome after 455. Nevertheless, fine ceramic tableware and amphorae for wine and olive oil continued to be manufactured in Roman tradition and were still exported as far as Rome itself and western Britain. There is only limited evidence of destruction at towns or villas, such as Carthage, Koudiat Zateur and Thuburbo Maius, although there was some ruralisation and a number of forums fell into disuse and some streets were built over. Also, there does not appear to have been any decline in identifiable rural sites until after the Byzantine reconquest. Agriculture, grain and olive oil production continued.\nMosaic from Bord-Djedid near the site of Carthage.

(Photo: (c) The Trustees of the British Museum)\nExcept at court, the Vandals adopted Roman fashions and the way of life of the province in which they had settled. Vandal kings and nobles patronised the arts and the historian Procopius tells us they loved fine clothes, music, hot baths, the theatre and the Roman aristocratic pursuits of hunting and horse-riding. However, they seem to have made little effort to integrate themselves and formed a ruling elite. Former Roman administrators served in the government and still sealed documents in the Roman manner. Vandal building projects include Hilderic\u2019s palace at Anclae and the poet Luxorius mentions the splendid, well-watered pleasure garden belonging to one Fridamal. If you get the chance to visit the Museum\u2019s new gallery Sutton Hoo and Europe AD 300\u20131100, look up on the wall at the mosaic from near Carthage, which may show a Vandal landowner riding out in front of his villa. The Vandals continued to maintain the aqueduct at Carthage and the churches that had been taken over for Arian worship. The discovery of a hoard of garnets from Carthage, including cut stones, suggests that there was a workshop producing cloisonn\u00e9 jewellery locally in contemporary style. The Albertini tablets from southern Numidia, a group of inscribed wooden tablets recording mainly land sales of around AD 490, show that literacy survived and that there was legal and administrative continuity during the Vandal period. The tablets are now in the Mus\u00e9e National des Antiquit\u00e9s, Algiers.\nAlthough we might find it hard to exonerate the Vandals, particularly for the sack of Rome and the persecution of the Catholics of North Africa, new archaeological discoveries help us to see them from a more balanced perspective. Indeed, even Victor of Vita, who recorded the persecution, acknowledged that not everyone shared his views. Furthermore, after the final defeat of the Vandals by the Byzantine army in 534, it is said that many provincials hoped for their return, because they had reduced the high level of taxation under the Roman Empire. In other words, had the Vandals been As much sinned against as sinners?"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-sinking-of-the-lusitania-medals-as-war-propaganda/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "The sinking of the Lusitania: medals as war propaganda", "author": "Henry Flynn, Project Curator", "timestamp": "2014-05-07 00:00:00", "text": "The Money and Medals Network is an Arts Council England-funded project that exists to build and develop relationships between UK museums that have numismatic collections.

The ship was sunk by a torpedo, a fact indicative of the increased use of submarines in marine warfare, which helped it become even more dangerous than it had been previously. The tragedy of the loss of life that included civilian passengers had global repercussions that contributed to the eventual decision taken by the United States to enter the conflict. It also sparked something of a medallic propaganda war.\nKarl Goetz, Lusitania medal (obverse). 1915, Germany, Iron, Diam. 5.7 cm, British Museum 1916,0707.9.(Photo: (c) Trustees of British Museum)\nThe German artist Karl Goetz was so incensed by the mere idea that a passenger liner might have been used for military purposes that he decided to produce a medal satirising the subject. He mistakenly stated on the medal that the date of the sinking was 5 May \u2013 two days earlier than the actual event. This caused an outcry in Britain and accusations that the sinking had been premeditated by the Germans. This use of the wrong date was in fact a mistake, but copies of the medal were made and distributed in Britain in protest against the Germans\u2019 use of medallic art to effectively celebrate a tragedy. The British copy had its own presentation box that also included a document detailing the reasons behind its production. Many of these medals have since found their way into the collections of museums across the country and will be featuring in commemorative displays this year and in 2015. The British Museum has an example of the German original and the British copy and both will be displayed in the new exhibition The other side of the medal: how Germany saw the First World War. Alongside my work on the Money and Medals Network, I have had some curatorial input into this exhibition curated by my colleague Tom Hockenhull.\nKarl Goetz, Lusitania medal (reverse). 1915, Germany, Iron, Diam. 5.7 cm, British Museum 1916,0707.9. (Photo: (c) Trustees of British Museum)\nThe medal itself is a fascinating object that is laced with satirical symbolism. On the obverse, the ship is depicted sinking under the waves. Weapons appear on the deck, a direct accusation that the ship had been carrying munitions, thus putting the lives of its passengers at risk, the notion that had so infuriated Goetz. The reverse shows unsuspecting passengers queuing up to buy their tickets from a personification of Death who sits inside the ticket booth. The warnings of a German man stood in the background and the \u2018U-Boat Danger\u2019 headline on a newspaper go unnoticed by the crowd. The inscription above the scene means \u2018business above all\u2019 and makes the message of the medal doubly clear. The presence of Death playing an active and malevolent role in the events is a theme that pervaded German medallic art during the First World War and this will be explored in the exhibition.\nPropeller from RMS Lusitania, National Museums Liverpool.

As that suggests, much of this world is a male world, and this chimes with popular perceptions of the Vikings as large, aggressive and bearded men. A more nuanced view of the Viking Age would recognise that even large, aggressive and bearded men had mothers, and very likely sisters, wives and daughters, and if you look closely at the exhibition you will find some personal items associated with such women. Nor did these women all stay at home while their menfolk went out into the wide world of raiding and trading. There is evidence for female traders in Russia, for instance, for far-travelling women, for queens and mistresses of large estates, as well as for women as victims and slaves. Also, women were an absolute prerequisite for the lasting establishment of a successful new nation in the uninhabited island of Iceland. Women can boast of many achievements in the Viking Age yet, in a quarter of a century of studying them, I find that the one thing I get asked about most often is the one thing I do not think they \u2018achieved\u2019, which was to become warriors.\nFigurine, possibly a Valkyrie (view from 4 sides). AD 800, H\u00e5rby, Funen, Denmark, Silver, niello, H 3.4 cm, National Museum of Denmark, C 39227 (Photo: \u00a9 Mationalmuseet, Copenhagen)\nA very small silver figurine, found in H\u00e5rby, in Denmark, in late 2012, may seem to contradict this. It undoubtedly represents a woman: she has the knotted pony-tail and long garment characteristic of many other representations of female figures in Viking art. What is unusual is that she is carrying an upright sword in her right hand and a shield in her left. The function of this figurine is unknown, and what it represents is also mysterious. If it is intended as an image of a woman warrior, then it is not a realistic one. Her garment is elaborate and beautifully decorated, and would be a real hindrance in combat, as would her uncovered head and its pony-tail. Male warriors did not always have helmets, as these were expensive, but would have had some kind of protective headgear like a leather cap. So we are left to conclude that the figure must be symbolic, rather than realistic, and most experts are inclined to label her as a valkyrie.\nValkyries are interesting and significant figures in the warrior cultures of the Viking Age. We know about them mainly from Old Norse literature, the poetry and prose written down in Iceland in the thirteenth century and later. The medieval Icelanders understood the function of valkyries literally from their name (valkyrja means \u2018chooser of the slain\u2019), and presented an image of them as handmaidens of the war-god Odin. He would send them to battle to choose those warriors who were worthy of dying and going to Valhalla, the hall of the slain, where they prepared themselves for the final battle of Ragnarok. There, the valkyries acted as hostesses, welcoming the dead warriors and serving them drink, as in the anonymous poem about Eirik Bloodaxe cited above. This literary understanding is confirmed by many Viking Age images of female figures, with long hair and gown, rather like the H\u00e5rby figurine, but holding out a drinking horn. When carrying out their duties on the battlefield, however, valkyries needed to be armed and the literary texts suggest that they were usually equipped with helmets, mail-coats and spears. Any association between valkyries and swords, on the other hand, is very rare as a sword, closely associated with masculinity, would be incongruous on a female figure. The sword was the weapon of choice, the prized possession and the status symbol of the better sort of Viking warrior. Many men, not all of them necessarily professional warriors, were buried with their swords, although they would also have an array of other weapons, like the man in the Kaupang burial, or the helmeted warrior depicted on the Middleton cross from North Yorkshire.\nThe undoubted successes of the Vikings in warfare and conquest were rooted in a well-developed Odinic ideology that sustained and strengthened them through their campaigns. The myth of Valhalla, the idea of death as a reward for the successful warrior, mediated by a female figure, is a powerful part of this ideology. It provided the warrior going into battle with an incentive and the dying warrior with a kind of consolation. Some of the literary texts develop this idea in a romantic way by telling of love affairs between warriors and valkyries though these, too, generally end in death. This martial ideology of which valkyries are a part also seeped into daily life. A typical valkyrie name, like Hild, means \u2018battle\u2019, and many ordinary women in the Viking Age also bore names (Iike the very common Gunnhild, or \u2018War-battle\u2019) that contained such elements. Yet that did not make them women warriors. Like most periods of human history, the Viking Age was not free from conflict, and war always impacts on all members of a society. It is likely that there were occasions when women had to defend themselves and their families as best they could, with whatever weapons were to hand. But there is absolutely no hard evidence that women trained or served as regular warriors in the Viking Age. Valkyries were an object of the imagination, creatures of fantasy rooted in the experience of male warriors. War was certainly a part of Viking life, but women warriors must be classed as Viking legend."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-viking-way-of-death/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "The Viking way of death", "author": "Neil Price, Professor of Archaeology, University of Aberdeen", "timestamp": "2014-04-16 00:00:00", "text": "Among the most fascinating things in the BP exhibition Vikings: life and legend are the numerous objects from burials and graves. The way that a people treat their dead can say a lot about their attitudes to life, and the Vikings were no exception. Although their graves take certain standardised forms \u2013 an earthen mound, a wooden chamber, a buried boat, and so on \u2013 in the detail of the rituals it\u2019s clear that almost every funeral was different, a personalised send-off. We know that this was an age of individuals, but what can we understand from this infinity of responses to death? Let\u2019s look more closely at just one example, which in all its unique complexity can stand for all the others.\nThe scene is a small, beachfront trading community, located in the outer reaches of the Oslofjord in Norway. We know this place as Kaupang, it just means \u2018market\u2019, but to its inhabitants it was known as Sk\u00edringssalr \u2013 something like \u2018the shining hall\u2019, perhaps named after its lord\u2019s residence on the hill behind. Nearly twenty years of excavations there have revealed rows of small houses and workshops strung out along the water\u2019s edge, with access to wharves where the ships came in from around the whole region. But this is for the living; outside the settlement, on promontories and on the low heights along the edges of the fjord, are the graves of the dead.\nOne of them seems at first to be a relatively simple affair. In the middle of the 9th century a man of indeterminate age was buried on his left side, probably dressed in a cloak because a brooch was found at his shoulder. His chest was pressed up against a large stone, and his body had been covered from the waist down with a cloth of very fine quality, drawn up like a blanket over his legs. With him were a handful of objects: two knives, a fire steel and two flints, a whetstone, some fragments of a soapstone bowl and what the excavators called an \u2018egg-shaped stone\u2019. Little in this is particularly exciting, though even this meagre grave has its own character and individualism, everything in it being there for a reason. However, it is what happened next that is remarkable.\nA boat burial from Kaupang, Norway, early 10th century. Illustration by \u00de\u00f3rhallur \u00der\u00e1insson, (\u00a9 Neil Price)\nSeveral decades later in the early 900s, an 8.5m-long boat was placed exactly on top of the dead man, its keel aligned precisely along the axis of his grave (which tells us that its location was remembered). Inside the boat were the bodies of four people: a man, two women and an infant, together with a number of animals. Around and above the bodies, laid out together with them or deposited above them as the boat was filled with earth, were masses of objects. Let us look a little closer.\nIn the prow a man and a woman lay apparently on blankets covering the decking. The woman was aged about 45-50 when she died, arranged on her back with her right hand on her breast, ankles crossed and her feet pointing into the prow. Her head was resting on a stone, like a pillow. She was expensively dressed, her clothes held together with silver jewellery. From her belt hung a knife and a key. To her immediate right was a bucket. Balanced across her knees, a weaving sword.\nA baby was wrapped in the woman\u2019s dress, bundled at her hip with her left hand resting on its head.\nLying head to head with the woman, arranged symmetrically with his feet pointing to the stern, was a man of unknown age. He had been placed slightly twisted, on his back but with legs flexed and bent to one side at the waist. Laid out around him were weapons: two axes, of which one was an antique; a throwing spear; a sheathed sword, its point precisely at his head, with two knives and a whetstone next to it; a shield (two more lay nearby); a quiver of arrows and therefore probably also a bow. A silver arm-ring lay above him. On his midriff lay an inverted frying pan. On the sword scabbard two spindle whorls had been carefully placed. A pot of German manufacture had been smashed and its pieces scattered over the man\u2019s body along with three glass beads, near a soapstone vessel. Two more of the latter were deposited at the man\u2019s feet. An iron dog chain was draped next to him, with a sickle somewhere nearby.\nAmidships, a bridled horse had been killed and laid on the deck. Its throat was probably cut, and it seems to have been decapitated and roughly dismembered, its limbs and body parts then placed back in approximately their anatomical positions. A single spur was placed on the mangled corpse.\nIn the stern of the boat was a second woman, apparently buried sitting up, either in a chair or hunched up against the rising end of the vessel. From her location and posture it is possible that the steering oar of the boat was resting in her hands. A whetstone and a bridle-bit leant against her feet, which touched the carcass of the horse. She was well-dressed in high fashion. Behind her was a shield. To her right, resting on the deck, another of those enigmatic \u2018egg-shaped stones\u2019 and a weaving sword of iron. To her left, an unusual iron staff pinned down under a large rock. Somewhere near her was an axe. In the woman\u2019s lap was an imported bowl of bronze that had been scratched with runes, i muntlauku, \u2018in the hand basin\u2019. The bowl contained some unidentified little metal objects, and the severed head of a dog. Its body lay across the woman\u2019s feet. One pair of its legs, perhaps detached, lay a little below the torso; the other legs were missing. Marks on the bones suggest crude carving of the flesh before the ragged skeleton was reassembled. Around the woman were also found fragments of wood and bark, pieces of sheet iron and objects of copper alloy; we do not know what they were.\nObjects of this type have been interpreted as staffs used by Viking sorceresses. From Gavle, Sweden (left) and Fuldby, Zealand, Denmark (right). (Photo: \u00a9 Nationalmuseet, Denmark)\nThe iron staff might offer a small clue to the nature of the dead steerswoman, as it is of a kind identified as a tool of the sorceresses called a v\u00f6lur, and other female magic-workers, who feature extensively in the Icelandic sagas. Several staffs of this kind can be seen in the exhibition.\nThe whole burial was then covered with earth and complex stone constructions, building up to a low mound. The excavators also found patches of cremated bone and wood mixed here and there in the deposit, hinting at further rituals about which we know nothing.\nIn all of this, note the detail, the precision, the deliberate choice and positioning of objects. The treatment of these Viking-Age dead is eloquent in its sheer specificity.\nSo what were they doing, on the banks of a Norwegian fjord in the early tenth century? A burial of four people in a boat, itself placed on top of another grave, a few decades old. Were the man and woman a couple, with their child? Or were they unrelated? Who was the woman sitting in the stern, apparently some kind of witch? Did they all die together, either violently or through illness? Was one or more of them killed to accompany the others in death? Whose were the boat and the animals, or did they belong to none of the dead? What do the objects mean, and would a contemporary understanding of them even approximate to our own? What connection did all of this have with the man under the keel? One thing is certain: it does not resemble any kind of funeral familiar to us.\nThey died a long time ago and we do not know their names, but these people of the Viking Age faced the same eternal questions of life and its meaning as still puzzle us today. The boat burial at Kaupang was one of their answers."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-die-that-struck-britains-first-coins/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "The die that struck Britain\u2019s first coins?", "author": "Ian Leins, Curator, Department of Coins and Medals and Emma Morris, Curator, Department of Coins and Medals", "timestamp": "2014-04-11 00:00:00", "text": "One of the most recent acquisitions made by the Department of Coins and Medals is a highly unusual object \u2013 an ancient punch or \u2018die\u2019 used to manufacture coins in the second century BC.

(Photo (c) Trustees of the British Museum)\nThe earliest coins found in Iron Age Britain date from around the second century BC and, until recently, it was believed that they were produced in Gaul (a region roughly equivalent to modern day France and Belgium) and imported into south-east England. These coins, known as Gallo Belgic A, were based on the gold coinage (staters) issued by King Philip II, ruler of the Greek kingdom of Macedon from 359 \u2013 336 BC and father of Alexander the Great.\nGold stater of Philip II, showing obverse (front) and reverse. 345 \u2013 310 BC, Greece, Gold, Diam.

Iron Age coins derived from these staters carry abstract versions of these images. The hair and laurel wreath on the image of Apollo, for example, are much exaggerated. Similarly, the image of the horse on the reverse of the coin has been stylised and is reminiscent of the Prehistoric chalk horses found on the hillsides of Britain, such as the one at Uffington.\nAerial view from a paramotor of the White Horse at Uffington. (Photo: (c) by Dave Price and licensed for reuse under this Creative Commons licence)\nClose examination of the coin die revealed that it was used in the production of the early Gallo-Belgic A coins. What this means is that, although it is the third Iron Age coin die to be found in the UK (the others are also in the British Museum), it is almost certainly the earliest. The most significant aspect of this discovery is the fact that it is a British find. This raises the intriguing possibility that the earliest known coins from Britain were actually made here and not just imports from the Continent.\nGallo-Belgic B coin die. 200 -125 BC, Copper alloy, Alton, Hampshire, British Museum\u00a02005,0418.1. (Photo: (c) Trustees of the British Museum)\nAround 250 Gallo-Belgic A coins are known from Britain and France, but unfortunately the new die cannot be linked to any of them. This fact has been used to suggest that it may have been a forger\u2019s die. In reality, however, we can read very little into the fact that we do not have an example of a coin struck using this die. Little is known about the mechanics of coin production in the Iron Age and, in particular, about the authorities that produced them. The distinction between an \u2018official\u2019 and a \u2018forger\u2019s\u2019 die may not be have been relevant in Iron Age society. A programme of scientific analysis will tell us more about how the die was made and used, but its precise origins are likely to remain a mystery."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-lives-of-others-in-runic-inscriptions/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "The lives of others in runic inscriptions", "author": "Martin Findell, Research Associate, University of Leicester", "timestamp": "2014-04-04 00:00:00", "text": "Call it perversity, but in my own research I\u2019ve always had a taste for the unfashionable and the unglamorous areas of runic writing. I get more excited about a name scratched onto the back of a brooch than about a large and richly decorated runestone; and as a historical linguist, I take more pleasure in trying to work out problems of the relationship between spelling, speech and the changing structure of language than in broader questions of cultural history and society. Of course the two are interdependent, and while I concern myself with the troublesome nuts-and-bolts details of language, language is an aspect of culture and must be studied alongside other aspects of culture. Even the briefest and most unattractive inscription is an instance of language use by real people who belonged to a community in which the act of writing had some purpose. Rather than regale you with tales of unstressed vowels, I thought it would be more interesting to share my interest in some of the texts we find written in runes, and what they might tell us about the people who produced them.\nGold finger-ring, engraved with a runic inscription. Late Anglo-Saxon, found in Cumbria, England. OA.10262\nOne of the most impressive objects in the Vikings exhibition (if somewhat overshadowed by the great Roskilde ship) is a replica of the Jelling stone. The original is at the large royal complex at Jelling in southern Denmark, and was commissioned by Harald Bluetooth to honour his parents and boast of his own achievements. The inscription says \u201cKing Harald ordered this monument made in memory of Gorm his father and \u00deorvi his mother; that Harald who won for himself all of Denmark and Norway, and who made the Danes Christian\u201d (translation based on that in the Samnordisk rundatabas).\nThe memorial text is formulaic, and similar to inscriptions found all over Viking-Age Scandinavia (with a particular concentration in the Uppland region of Sweden, where several thousand have been found). The stone is probably best seen as a political statement, particularly when it comes to Harald\u2019s display of his Christian credentials; lest the viewer be left in any doubt, one face of the stone is carved with an image of the Crucifixion.\nThe Jelling stone is an inscription made for a king, but not by him. The people who did the actual work \u2013 and importantly for linguists, these were probably also the people who made decisions about things like spelling \u2013 were craftsmen, possibly attached to Harald\u2019s court, who remain silent in the historical record.\nOne of my favourite inscriptions lies at the other end of the scale: a short, personal message, informally scratched on the back of a brooch found in a sixth-century woman\u2019s grave at Bad Krozingen in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany. The inscription reads boba:leub agirike, \u201cB\u014dba, dear to Agirik\u201d. B\u014dba is the name of a woman, perhaps that of the woman buried with the brooch (although not necessarily \u2013 valuable pieces of jewellery like this could be passed on as heirlooms, or looted and given to someone other than the original owner), and Agirik is a man. It is likely that he wrote the inscription himself \u2013 it is not a work of professional craftsmanship (which the brooch certainly is), and the fact that the message is on the back of the brooch means that it would not have been visible when worn. We have no way of knowing what the relationship between these two people was. They might have been husband and wife, father and daughter, brother and sister, or related in some other way; but this slender piece of evidence helps to remind us that these were real people, people who knew and cared for one another. It might not tell us much about the large-scale political and religious trends of the society in which they lived, but it brings both the words and objects of the past to life as something familiar, human and all too short-lived."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/did-women-in-greece-and-rome-speak/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "Did women in Greece and Rome speak?", "author": "Mary Beard", "timestamp": "2014-03-24 00:00:00", "text": "Did women in Greece and Rome speak? Stupid question; of course they did. They must have chattered and joked together, laughed at the silliness of their menfolk, advised (or chatted up) their husbands, given lessons to their children\u2026 and much, much more.\nBut nowhere in the ancient world did they ever have a recognised voice in public \u2013 beyond, occasionally, complaining about the abuse they must often have suffered. Those who did speak out got ridiculed as being androgynes (\u2018men-women\u2019). The basic motto (as for Victorian children) was that women should be seen and not heard, and best of all not seen either.\nThis streak of misogyny made a big impression on me when I first started learning ancient Greek about 45 years ago. One of the first things I read in Greek back then was part of Homer\u2019s Odyssey \u2013 one of that pair of great epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey that stand at the very beginning of the whole tradition of western literature.\nGold finger-ring with a seated woman, perhaps Penelope. Western Greek, 400-300 BC, possibly made in Sicily, Gold, Diam. 2.2 cm, British Museum, 1867,0508.402. (Photo \u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum)\nI remember even now coming across an extraordinary passage in the first book of the poem. Penelope, who is waiting loyally for her husband, Odysseus, to return from the Trojan War, comes downstairs from her apartment in the palace to find a bard singing. His song tells of the terrible and deathly struggles the Greek heroes are having in getting back home after the war to conquer Troy. Not surprisingly Penelope, thinking of her own husband\u2019s troubles, is upset and asks the bard to choose a happier theme. But no sooner has she spoken than her son Telemachus \u2013 not much more than a wet-behind-the-ears teenager \u2013 tells her to pipe down and go back upstairs to her weaving, \u201cfor speech is the business of men\u201d.\nIt stuck in my mind (as I kid, I always rather admired the Greeks, but this seemed a terrible black spot almost to match slavery). I never imagined then that I would come back to reflect on this incident again, when I was thinking about how the voices of modern women have often been silenced too. Of course, that silence isn\u2019t so dramatic. But when I agreed to give a London Review of Books Winter Lecture at the British Museum, on the public voice of women today, I kept coming back to the ancient world \u2013 and to the sense that women\u2019s silence was very deeply embedded in our culture.\nEdward Burne-Jones, \u2018The Legend of Goode Wimmen\u2019; Philomene, with a woman (Philomela) standing by her loom holding a shuttle in an interior, with a half-woven tapestry with the story of Pholomene and Tereus, looking out of the window. 1896, Paper, wood-engraving, H: 12.2 cm, W: 16.8 cm, British Museum 1912,0612.372.\u00a0(Photo \u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum)\nIt was fascinating (if slightly chilling) to collect some of the different ways that the Greeks and Romans so clearly paraded the idea that women should not speak out. These ranged from Ovid\u2019s story in his Metamorphoses about the rape victim Philomela having her tongue cut out to prevent her naming her rapist (though she eventually managed to denounce him by weaving an account of what happened) to the abuse of one Roman woman who did get up to speak in the forum as a \u2018barking\u2019 (that is, non-human) androgyne.\nAttributed to: The Danaid Group, Red-figured hydria, depicting the rape of Kassandra by the lesser Ajax, son of Oileus, in Athena\u2019s temple at Troy, 340-320 BC. Campania, Italy, Pottery, H: 33.9cm, British Museum\u00a01824,0501.35.\u00a0(Photo \u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum)\nIn fact, it was hard to choose which examples to use for my lecture, and many people have written in since with even more, and sometimes even better, examples. One of the very best is the myth of the virgin prophetess Cassandra, the daughter of the king of Troy, who was \u2013 when the city fell \u2013 taken by king Agamemnon to be his concubine (she was eventually murdered, with the king, by his wife Clytemnestra). But before that, Cassandra\u2019s lot was always to prophesy the truth but never to be believed. It is a wonderful twist on the idea that women\u2019s speech is never authoritative: even when it really is true, it doesn\u2019t seem so to listeners.\nIn antiquity, it is true that \u2013 almost without exception (perhaps the weird Diotima in Plato\u2019s Symposium is one) \u2013 you only hear a woman speak when she is about to die, or when she is speaking up for the concerns of women and the home (as did Antigone, when she defends the proper burial of her dead brother). Otherwise, as Telemachus put it, speech is for men.\nNow, of course, I don\u2019t think that the classical tradition simply explains why many women have such a hard time getting their voice heard even now. We have come a long way since then. All the same, my lecture does argue that if we want to do something about some of the current issues women face when they try to speak up, it\u2019s important to think of the very long western history of women being shut up."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/new-evidence-of-human-cancer-found-at-ancient-amara-west/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "New evidence of human cancer found at ancient Amara West", "author": "Michaela Binder, PhD student, Durham University and Neal Spencer, Keeper of Ancient Egypt and Sudan", "timestamp": "2014-03-17 00:00:00", "text": "We generally assume cancer is strongly related to modern lifestyle and environment.

Only nine more individuals with \u2013 often tentative \u2013 evidence of cancer predate the first millennium AD. The majority of these individuals come from Ancient Egypt.

Founded around 1300 BC in the reign of Seti I, the town was designed as a new centre of the Egyptian control of Upper Nubia (Kush). The British Museum has been working at the site since 2008. Excavations in the town allow us glimpses of ancient lives: how houses were refurbished, what people ate, religious and ritual practices, where rubbish was disposed \u2013 and how the town changed over two centuries of occupation. Bioarchaeological work in the cemeteries is providing further insights into the ancient inhabitants: their life expectancy, diet and health.\nThe underground chamber tomb where skeleton 244-8 was buried.\nSkeleton 244-8. The scarab (inset) was placed in the man\u2019s hands.\nThis individual (skeleton 244-8) was buried in a large underground chamber tomb (G244), perhaps used for a family around 1200 BC. The body was placed in a painted wooden coffin, with an Egyptian-style scaraboid placed in the hands. The bones of the torso, upper arms and upper legs have a large number of holes, 5-25mm in diameter. Radiographic examination of the bones revealed the holes are even larger beneath the bone surface. These holes were caused by metastatic carcinoma spreading from a soft tissue cancer: the oldest complete skeleton of a metastatic cancer found, anywhere, to date. The study, jointly conducted by researchers at the British Museum and Durham University is being published in the Public Library of Science journal PLOS One.\nSmall holes in the breast bone (arrows). The radiographic image shows enlargement and additional holes underneath the surface.\nWhat caused such a case of cancer? Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease which was and still is a major health problem in the Nile valley, can cause breast cancer in men. Smoke from woodfires within houses continues to be a problem in modern Sudan. At Amara West, most of the small houses were provided with cylindrical bread ovens, often three side-by-side in a small room. Careful excavation has revealed that many of these oven rooms were roofed: these would have quickly filled up with smoke, exposing people to potentially harmful substances.\nSmall room in house E13.4, originally roofed, with three bread ovens.\nUnderstanding the evolution, history and factors that could have caused cancer prior to the onset of modern living conditions is important not only for archaeology but even more so for medical research. Skeletal human remains, set within a well-documented historical, archaeological and environmental context are a key element for any such attempts. This may in future be crucial to develop new research strategies and therapies in order to tackle what has become the world\u2019s deadliest disease.\nThe identification of such cases, and other diseases, among the population of towns such as Amara West, provides a more direct sense of ancient experience than those provided by ancient texts, architectural remains or the objects people left behind.\nFollow the latest from the British Museum team now excavating at Amara West."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-vikings-are-here/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "The Vikings are here...", "author": "Gareth Williams, Exhibition Curator", "timestamp": "2014-03-07 00:00:00", "text": "Lo, it is nearly thirty-five years since the Vikings last came to this Museum, and nobody believed that such an influx of fantastic material from overseas (as well as the UK) could be made\u2026*\nTo be fair, the BP exhibition Vikings: life and legend lacks some of the drama of the original Viking attack on Lindisfarne in 793. We haven\u2019t had fiery dragons in the sky (unless you count the Aurora Borealis coming unusually far south), and there hasn\u2019t been much in the way of destruction or slaughter. Nor is it likely that this exhibition will be remembered 1200 years after the event, although in an age of globalised communication, there is no doubt that the exhibition has attracted considerably more notice in the last few days than the attack on Lindisfarne did at the time. Nevertheless, as the largest Viking exhibition in the UK for over 30 years, it has the potential to shape our definition of the Viking Age.\nThe attack on Lindisfarne is often used as a starting point for a period which extended until around 1050 or 1100. The defeat of the Norwegian Harald Hard-ruler (whose story is so brilliantly told in a new illustrated children\u2019s adventure book by Project Curator Tom Williams) at Stamford Bridge near York in 1066 provides another convenient end date from an English perspective, although it doesn\u2019t have much meaning elsewhere. The idea of a \u2018Viking Age\u2019 has formed part of modern historical perceptions since the 19th century, but the interpretation of that period, and of the Vikings themselves, has changed many times since then. One of the most memorable experiences of my own childhood was visiting the great Viking exhibition here at the British Museum in 1980. It brought together an unprecedented collection of Viking material, interpreted in line with what was then current thinking on the Vikings. Recent archaeological discoveries in Viking settlements in Britain, Ireland and Scandinavia played an important part in raising public awareness of the less violent aspects of life in the Viking Age. It was an exhibition that helped to define the Vikings for a generation, and the catalogue Viking Artefacts by the guest curator James Graham-Campbell remains an essential reference for any serious study of Viking culture.\nMass grave from Weymouth. Exh. cat. chapter 2, fig. 30. \u00a9 Dorset County Council / Oxford Archaeology\nOf course, things have changed since 1980. There have been many new finds, due in part to the introduction of the Portable Antiquities Scheme which encourages the reporting of metal-detected objects. The Vale of York Hoard, for example, displayed in its entirety for the first time at the British Museum in this exhibition, was found by metal detectorists in 2004. And new material keeps on coming, with dramatic finds excavated even in the course of preparing this exhibition, necessitating rewrites and adaptations as we went along. The mass grave of Vikings found near Weymouth excavated in 2009 and the 2011 Ardnamurchan burial (the first complete example of a Viking boat burial from the British mainland) are prime examples.\nFigurine, possibly a Valkyrie, c. AD 800, from H\u00e5rby, Funen, Denmark. \u00a9 Nationalmuseet, Copenhagen\nA tiny three-dimensional Valkyrie amulet, found as recently as 2013, demonstrates how up-to-date the finds presented in this exhibition really are. Of course, the star of the show \u2013 the remains of Roskilde 6, the longest Viking ship ever discovered \u2013 is one of the most important and awe-inspiring Viking discoveries of recent times.\nJust as important has been the impact of new research, particularly in the areas of ritual and belief and Viking-age economies. Some of this work has been pioneered by those behind the 1980 exhibition, and it is a privilege to have the opportunity to present their work and set out the state of current thinking for a new generation. As Professor Ronald Hutton astutely observed in his review in the New Statesman, the major overarching themes of the exhibition \u2013 global communication, cultural interaction and diversity, technological sophistication \u2013 are ideas with a profound significance to the modern world.\nLooking back through the email trail, Vikings: Life and Legend has been over six years in the making. Apart from the challenge of delivering an engaging and informative exhibition, we have had the added issues of incorporating a 37 metre-long ship, and being the first exhibition in the new Sainsbury Exhibitions Gallery, on which building had not yet even commenced when we started planning the exhibition six years ago. It has been an enormous team effort to get us here; While curators get the media attention on such occasion, the conservators, designers, loans administrators, object handlers and many other staff have equally important roles behind the scenes. The process has at times been exhilarating, exhausting, and frustrating. As Charles Dickens wrote, \u2018It was the best of times, it was the worst of times\u2019, and he only had to deal with two cities. This exhibition has had the added complication of being planned in three. Despite all that, we have finally reached the point where the exhibition is ready to show to the public, and it is enormously rewarding to see the positive response which we have already had from journalists and those who have seen the exhibition. If the response of the public as a whole is as positive, I think that all of us involved in the exhibition will be very satisfied. And if a single visitor is as inspired by this exhibition as the younger me was by its predecessor, then I shall personally be delighted.\n*(With apologies to Alcuin of York.)"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/vikings-in-russia/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Vikings in Russia", "author": "Tom Williams, Project Curator, Vikings", "timestamp": "2014-02-28 00:00:00", "text": "Scandinavians traditionally do rather well at the Winter Olympics \u2013 for perhaps obvious reasons \u2013 but their Viking ancestors would have been no stranger to some of the delights of Sochi. Skis were used and valued in the North. Earl Rognvald I of Orkney boasted that (among several other skills) he could \u2018glide on skis\u2019, and the god Ullr was also associated with skiing. In fact, he has been taken as a sort of unofficial patron of the winter ski community, whose members often wear medallions depicting the god \u2013 there would no doubt have been a good number of Ullr talismans among the skiers in Sochi.\nAnd, while the bob-sleigh may have been unknown, sledges of various kinds are certainly known from Viking burials, including a particularly beautiful example that was found in the famous boat burial from Oseberg in Norway.\nWhat is perhaps most surprising of all \u2013 at least to those brought up with a Western European education \u2013 is that the Vikings (possibly even skiing Vikings) were working their way up and down the river systems of Russia and Ukraine more than a thousand years ago, at the same time that their kinsmen were raiding the coastlines of England, Ireland and France. Objects now on loan to the British Museum for the BP exhibition Vikings: life and legend indicate the extent of Scandinavian settlement from the Baltic to the Black Sea, and the far-flung contacts established by the eastern trading network, including glittering hoards of silver coins and jewellery from Gnezdovo and Lyuboyezha in Russia.\nEastern style axe-head. This axe, with its backwards projecting knob, is typical of weapons from eastern Baltic lands.

(Photo:\u00a0\u00a9 State Historical Museum, Moscow)\nThe last time the British Museum put on an exhibition about the Vikings was in 1980, and at that time the cold war meant there was little academic contact between east and west. It was simply impossible to secure loans from museums on the other side of the iron curtain, and many new discoveries were never reported in the west. This was compounded by the official Soviet policy on the origins of the Slavic-speaking countries of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus that minimised the role of Germanic-speaking Scandinavians in the development of urban life in those nations.\nTimes have changed, however, and the role of the Vikings \u2013 particularly those from Sweden \u2013 is increasingly recognised as an important one in the development of a new culture in Eastern Europe, a people known in the Byzantine Empire and Islamic world as the R\u016bs. Vast quantities of Islamic silver travelled up the rivers of Russian and Ukraine in exchange for amber, slaves and furs, leaving a trace in Viking-Age silver hoards found far from their eastern origins.\nThe Vale of York Hoard, acquired jointly by the British Museum and York Museums Trust in 2010, contains Slavic silverwork from Russia and Islamic coins from as far afield as Uzbekistan and Afghanistan\nIt wasn\u2019t just objects that travelled the river routes. The exhibition will also display objects from the graves of men and women who died in Russia and Ukraine and who chose to identify with a Scandinavian heritage through the style of their clothing and the decoration on their weapons. Discoveries of amulets depicting small figures suggest that some even brought their gods with them to new lands.\nPerhaps Sochi 2014 wasn\u2019t the first time that Ullr had travelled to the Black Sea coast."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/the-earliest-human-footprints-outside-africa-2/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "The earliest human footprints outside Africa", "author": "Nicholas Ashton, Curator, Palaeolithic and Mesolithic Collections", "timestamp": "2014-02-07 00:00:00", "text": "Happisburgh has hit the news again.

Whereas three years ago the news was the oldest human site in northern Europe at over 800,000 years ago, now we have the oldest footprints outside Africa. Happisburgh just keeps giving up surprises.\nHappisburgh, Norfolk\nWe found them by pure chance in May last year. We were about to start a geophysics survey on the foreshore, when an old-time friend and colleague, Martin Bates from Trinity St David\u2019s University, pointed out the unusual surface. The site lies beneath the beach sand in sediments that actually underlie the cliffs. The cliffs are made up of soft sands and clays, which have been eroding at an alarming rate over the last ten years, and even more so during the latest winter storms. As the cliffs erode they reveal these even earlier sediments at their base, which are there for a short time before the sea washes them away.\nEarly human footprints revealed at Happisburgh, UK\nBack in May, high seas had removed most of the beach sand to reveal ancient estuary mud. We\u2019d seen these many times before and had been digging them for years. Normally they consist of flat laminated silts, but in a small area of about 12 square metres there was a jumble of elongated hollows. Martin pointed them out and said that they looked like footprints. He\u2019d been studying similar prints on the Welsh coast near Aberystwyth, but they were just a few thousand years old; we knew the sediments at Happisburgh were over 800,000 years old.\nI imagine that there will be plenty of sceptics out there, as were we initially, but the more we eliminated the other possibilities, the more convinced we became. The sediments are hard and compacted \u2013 you can jump on them today and leave little impression. And there are no erosional processes that leave those sort of hollows.\nThe moment of truth came after we\u2019d recorded them. We returned a few days later with Sarah Duffy from York University to photograph them using photogrammetry, a technique that uses multiple digital photographs and stitches them together with some clever software. The method is great, but the weather wasn\u2019t \u2013 lashing rain, an incoming tide and fast-fading light. By the end we were cold, soaked, demoralised and still not necessarily convinced.\nThe results though were amazing. For the first time we had proper overhead images and could identify heels, arches and in one case toes. Isabelle de Groote from Liverpool John Moores University did much of the analysis. It seems that there were perhaps five individuals, both adults and children. The tallest was probably about 5 foot 9 inches tall. So who were they? Although we have no human bones, the most likely species was Homo antecessor or \u2018Pioneer Man\u2019, who lived in southern Europe at this time. They were smaller-brained than ourselves, but walked upright and fully bipedal.\nWe actually know very little else about the people who left these prints, but from the plant and animal remains at Happisburgh we know that they were able to survive winters colder than today. We\u2019re still asking questions of whether they had clothing and shelter or controlled the use of fire.

Spending long periods of time within a building of such age, I would often start to wonder about how the area would have looked before the castle was built. Every morning I would pass the remains of Roman walls at Tower Bridge station, walls that were repaired and refortified by King Alfred the Great in response to the very real threat of Viking raids from the river. Blotting out the great hulk of HMS Belfast, Tower Bridge and the modern office blocks that now crowd the banks, I would try to imagine the awe and the terror that a Londoner would have felt a thousand years ago, standing on the city walls, watching the carved and gilded prows of dragon ships silently gliding up the Thames. Viking fleets and armies raided and besieged the city on numerous occasions, and the river has given up dozens of weapons that might have ended up there as a result of those conflicts.\nIron axe-head found in the Thames at Hammersmith, Viking, 10th-11th century (1909,0626.8)\nExactly 1000 years ago, in January 1014, people living in England would have been looking to the year ahead with a great deal of uncertainty. A Danish Viking, Svein Forkbeard, sat on the English throne. He had taken it by force only a few weeks previously, having forced the submission of the English nobility and towns. He would die, suddenly, on the 3rd of February. But a fleet of Danish ships still lay menacingly off the English coast, and on board one of those ships was Svein\u2019s son, Cnut, later to rule England as part of the greatest north sea empire the world would ever know.\nThis January, a Danish warship \u2013 Roskilde 6 \u2013 has returned to England and has taken up residence in the new Sainsbury Exhibitions Gallery at the British Museum, my current place of work. Happily, the dark days of the eleventh century are behind us, and the team from the National Museum of Denmark (NMD) who accompanied the ship to London have not (so far) demanded any tribute or burned any villages. In fact, getting the ship here has been part of a long period of close collaboration between the BM and the NMD (and Berlin State Museums, where Roskilde 6 will head next on its travels).\n\u00a9 National Museum of Denmark (Nationalmuseet)\nThe Danish team of conservators and technicians, led by Kristiane Straetkvern, have been responsible for the conservation and analysis of the surviving timbers of Roskilde 6 (approx. 20% survives of the original ship), and for constructing the extraordinary stainless steel frame in which the timbers are displayed. This is a breathtaking work of modern design in its own right. The frame has been precision engineered in dozens of individual pieces which can be loaded into a single container for shipment and reassembled under the expert handling of the NMD\u2019s installation team. The timbers are packed flat in their own climate controlled container.\nThe installation of Roskilde 6 at the British Museum. \u00a9 Paul Raftery\nThe installation of Roskilde 6 at the British Museum\nThe finished installation is a wonderful marriage of modern Scandinavian design and engineering with one of the greatest technological achievements of the Viking Age: at over 37 metres long, Roskilde 6 is the longest Viking ship ever discovered and would have been massive even by the standards of around AD 1025, its probable date of construction. It would have taken huge amounts of manpower and raw materials to construct the ship, resources only available to the most powerful of northern rulers. It may even have been built by Cnut himself\u2026"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/was-the-ark-round-a-babylonian-description-discovered/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "Was the ark round? A Babylonian description discovered", "author": "Irving Finkel, Assistant Keeper of the Department of the Middle East", "timestamp": "2014-01-24 00:00:00", "text": "I\u2019ve just come from the press conference launching my new book, The Ark Before Noah. As I told the journalists, it all started with a fairly normal event for a museum curator: a member of the public bringing in an object that had long been in their family to have it identified. As often happens in my case, it was a cuneiform tablet. The visitor, Douglas Simmonds, had been given it by his father for passing his exams. It was part of a modest collection: a few tablets, some cylinder seals, a lamp or two and some pieces from China and Egypt. His father, an inveterate curio hunter, had picked them up after the War in the late 1940s.\nWith kind permission of Douglas Simmonds\nThis tablet, however, turned out to be one in a million. The cuneiform was a sixty-line passage from the ancient Babylonian Story of the Flood. This story had been well known since the 1870s, when George Smith, a brilliant decipherer who worked at the British Museum, first identified the story known from the Book of Genesis in a seventh-century cuneiform tablet from Nineveh. The two accounts \u2013 Babylonian and biblical \u2013 were closely related. The new tablet, however, written in about 1750 BC, has startling new contents.\nWhen the gods decided to wipe out mankind with a flood, the god Enki, who had a sense of humour, leaked the news to a man called Atra-hasis, the \u2018Babylonian Noah,\u2019 who was to build the Ark. Atra-hasis\u2019s Ark, however was round. To my knowledge, no one has ever thought of that possibility. The new tablet also describes the materials and the measurements to build it: quantities of palm-fibre rope, wooden ribs and bathfuls of hot bitumen to waterproof the finished vessel. The result was a traditional coracle, but the largest the world had ever dreamed of, with an area of 3,600 sq. metres (equivalent to two-thirds the area of a football pitch), and six-metre high walls. The amount of rope prescribed, stretched out in a line, would reach from London to Edinburgh!\nTo anyone who has the typical image learnt from children\u2019s toys and book illustrations in mind, a round Ark is bizarre at first, but, on reflection, the idea makes sense. A waterproofed coracle would never sink and being round isn\u2019t a problem \u2013 it never had to go anywhere: all it had to do was float and keep the contents safe: a cosmic lifeboat. Palm-and-pitch coracles had been seen on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers since time immemorial: they were still a common sight on Iraq\u2019s great waterways in the 1950s.\nDeciphering the tablet was a great adventure, but one development soon led to another: a documentary film in which the Ark is being built according to these 3700-year-old instructions (although not quite full size), and the commissioning of a book.\nMap of the World (ME 92687)\nWriting it led to some demanding questions: what was the origin of the Flood Story? How did it pass from Babylonian cuneiform to Biblical Hebrew? Then I discovered that a line from the new tablet was quoted on our famous Map of the World tablet, showing where the Babylonian believed that Ark had landed. I also got to address other questions I have been asking myself for years: how does cuneiform writing really work? What were the ancient Babylonians really like?"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/a-loan-from-berlin-a-lion-from-babylon/", "category": "Curator's corner", "title": "A loan from Berlin: a lion from Babylon", "author": "Alexandra Fletcher, Curator, Middle East Department", "timestamp": "2013-12-19 00:00:00", "text": "As the weather turns colder and the days shorter the Museum has been loaned a reminder of warmer, sunnier climes, which is helping to beat the mid-winter chill.

Although there is little evidence to confirm his passion for gardening, it is certain that Nebuchadnezzar commissioned other major building projects in Babylon, to glorify the capital of his empire. Inscriptions stamped on bricks reveal the extent of these works. In the city of Babylon, glazed bricks in bright shades of blue, yellow and white were used to create public monuments that emphasised the power of the king and the gods.

The former term is the more fashionable Latinised Greek word while testum represents the Italian tradition for these ovens.\nCurrently on display in the Life and death in Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition at the British Museum, there is a unique double casserole/oven with a base and domed top. In this post I will discuss the results of preliminary experiments I\u2019ve been undertaking with a replica of this so-called clibanus oven.\nA clibanus oven over charcoal\nThis oven appears to be designed to allow fire to be above and below the food being cooked. This concept is found in recipes in the Roman cookery book known as Apicius for a dish called a patina which is a thick frittata cooked in a vessel of the same name. The instructions are as follows: \u2018grease a clean dish and put it in the hot embers, pour the mixture in, allow the embers to be above and below (the dish).\u2019\nReaders of Apicius are not told precisely how this may happen but we can imagine the dish must have had a lid for the fire to be on top of the food. There are many North African-ware lidded casseroles that would suit this technique, with a small base that sat in the embers on the hearth and curved walls to allow embers to be pushed beneath the vessel, from the Roman period. The lids had a slightly curved outer rim which would have kept the embers away from the food when the lid was removed: a design feature similar to the flanged single oven I described in my second post. I have experimented with this technique too using a vessel created by Chris Lydamore and found it very successful.\nDrawing by Dan Shadrake\nLine illustrations taken from my edition of the Latin text of Apicius shown here demonstrate just how versatile this kind of equipment can be. The single testum/clibanus can function with a completely separate smaller dish inside and what seems to have happened with this new vessel is that the roasting dish becomes integrated as a double unit.\nDrawing by Dan Shadrake\nIn Apicius the foods described as being cooked in a clibanus like this one are generally rather small and defined as roasting or pot roasting. Recipes include a dry roasted, stuffed dormouse (Ap. 8.9); stuffed kidneys roasted in oil and fish sauce (Ap. 7.8); a neck joint also cooked in a layer of sauce (Ap. 7.5.5) and a boned stuffed kid (Ap. 8.6.6).\nDrawing by Dan Shadrake\nInitially I tried a favourite dish known as \u2018Parthian chicken\u2019; technically a \u2018pot roast\u2019 (Apicius 6.8.3). Chicken pieces are cooked in a ceramic dish in a mixture of wine and fish sauce with caraway, lovage, asafoetida and pepper. We are simply told to cook it without any indication as to whether it\u2019s on a heat source or in one. I found straight away that I had to provide twice the space and twice the fire size to heat both pieces of this new vessel in the same way as I would for the single oven.\nThis implies a more sophisticated kitchen with a greater volume of fire at the disposal of the cook. The recipe does not suggest you fry the meat first but I tried by adding oil and heating the bottom dish and found that this was very possible. When the vessel was put together, despite the flat base which prevents the embers going right underneath it, the fire is still able to be placed under and on top of the wide flange and as the fire must also be placed on the lid, we can assume that it\u2019s possible to have three levels of fire around the dish with the potential to create an intense level of heat.\nOven with charcoal beneath and on top of it\nAs the cooking progressed I was able to check inside and found that the sauce was simmering consistently all around the meat and generating plenty of steam which, in a similar way to a traditional tagine, gathers in the dome and falls back into the dish, preventing the meat from drying out. The chicken legs cooked in 45 minutes to a degree whereby the leg bone came out of the meat when pulled which was quite impressive!\nChicken cooking in the oven\nIn order to test the vessel for its dry baking efficiency I heated both pieces as before but left the base vessel for longer. It was clear from other cooking experiments I had conducted with Roman ceramic vessels over charcoal that when the fabric stays dry over intense radiant heat it is much more fragile and susceptible to cracking. Which, sadly, happened. The base vessel cracked quite quickly but only from one side and the subsequent bake was completed. I did not get that wonderful perky \u2018lift\u2019 one expects of a bake stone but as the dome is quite shallow it does not seem to me likely that the vessel was used to bake risen loaves of bread.\nFlatter bread is generally baked with a drop scone technique on an open bake stone and the lid is unnecessary. In my experiments the colour and crust came out quite good and the crumb light and airy. I need to bake more bread in the vessel and also attempt to bake other cakes such as the libum \u2018Roman cheese cake\u2019 in order to determine whether baking was truly possible in these vessels.\nBread in the oven\nFirst thoughts after cooking with the vessel three times now? It is super-efficient as a general purpose casserole for what we would call \u2018pot roasting\u2019: roasting in small amounts of liquid. It has proved less effective as a dry oven whether it be for meat or bread and cakes.\nThe naming of things and in fact the concept of defining the purpose of an artefact from the past is very problematic as we almost always use modern concepts to define ancient things and this can interfere with our interpretation. So for instance today we bake in an oven, but stew or braise in a casserole. A casserole generally functions today with wet food or sauces and either inside an oven with a radiant heat source or above a heat source on a hob. Rarely does it function as an oven in itself as the ancient casseroles seem to do when the fire is in direct contact with the vessel.\nI think we can be fairly certain that the vessel in the exhibition is a form of clibanus but that term seems to be rather more complex than simply a \u2018portable oven\u2019. It might be better to define this ancient clibanus not as an oven at all but as a \u2018tagine\u2019."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/new-discoveries-of-cave-art-in-the-caribbean/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "New discoveries of cave art in the Caribbean", "author": "Jago Cooper, Curator of the Americas, Department of Africa, Oceania and the Americas", "timestamp": "2013-07-09 00:00:00", "text": "At the end of May, I returned to the British Museum from an exploratory research visit to an uninhabited national park on the island of Mona in Puerto Rico. My colleague Dr Alice Samson, McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, and I had found more than we planned or expected when we flew to the Caribbean two weeks earlier.\nThere are hundreds of caves on Isla de Mona many with entrances like this one on cliff faces overlooking the coastline below.\nAlerted to the potential presence of archaeological sites dating to the pre-Columbian period (prior to AD 1492 when Christopher Columbus first arrived in the Americas) by National park manager Tony Nieves, we went to take a look. We discovered extensive pre-Columbian mining and artistic practices deep inside caves, with an astonishing abundance and diversity of new rock art including pictographs and finger-incised designs representing abstract, human and animal images.\nThe pre-Columbian iconography found in many of these cave systems extends through galleried chambers covering large portions of the walls and ceilings.\nDesigns, which cover the walls and ceilings of hundreds of metres of the darkest caverns and tunnels across the island were executed by the application of pigments to cave walls, and by previously undocumented techniques such as incising and dragging fingers through the very soft, plaster-like deposit on the cave walls. This particular technique left white trails of surprising freshness, complexity and elaborateness.\nMany of the representations are clearly identifiable. This figure with the swirling arms represents Guabancex, the pre-Columbian deity associated with the destructive force of the hurricane.\nStrikingly the technique also appears to have been a way of harvesting the soft deposit on the cave walls as is attested by the vigorous finger scratching across large expanses of cave surfaces in all of the sites we visited. These extractive activities, or evidence for ancient mining, rather than being indiscriminate movements, were systematic and deliberate actions leaving complex designs.\nThis figure is identical to the famous Puerto Rican Sol de Jayuya rock art image found in central Puerto Rico.\nAlongside Dr Samson I\u2019m working in collaboration with the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources and the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture to develop a project to study the pre-Columbian archaeology of the island and protect this unique Caribbean heritage. Many of the caves we explored have not been visited since guano (essentially bat excrement, a very effective fertilizer) miners working there downed tools 120 years ago, leaving the ruins of railway tracks, wagons and sometimes their initials on the cave walls.\nThe caves are incredibly well preserved sites, but are at very high risk of future destruction due to the soft texture of the walls and confined spaces for visitors to gain access. A glimpse of this archaeology is shown in our project gallery page.\nThe evidence we found not only dramatically expands our repertoire of pre-Columbian iconography, but has the potential to change understandings of past cave use in this area at this time, as well as traditional definitions of rock art."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/ad-79-in-hd-broadcasting-pompeii-live/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "AD 79 in HD: broadcasting Pompeii Live", "author": "Tim Plyming, Head of Digital Media and Publishing", "timestamp": "2013-06-14 00:00:00", "text": "At time of writing we are under a week away from two live cinema events for the British Museum exhibition Life and death in Pompeii and Herculaneum, and I wanted to give you a bit more detail about what we are planning, as well as a glimpse behind the scenes at the huge amount of activity now taking place.\nPompeii Live presenters Bettany Hughes and Peter Snow\nOur ambition from the beginning has been to provide an exclusive \u2018private view\u2019 experience of the exhibition.

In the exhibition we felt it was important to show why Herculaneum is just as important as its famous neighbour. The cities were destroyed by the same catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79, yet at different times and under different circumstances. For these reasons Herculaneum differed from Pompeii, not only in its life as a smaller coastal city, but also in the incredible things that were preserved there. As a result it has different stories to tell.\nHerculaneum was actually the first of the two cities to be re-discovered in the eighteenth century. In 1710 a well-digger chanced upon the theatre, where later finds included the bronze statue of the wealthy ex-slave and city benefactor, Lucius Mammius Maximus.\nBronze statue of Lucius Mammius Maximus. (Photo: \u00a9 Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Napoli e Pompei.)\nHerculaneum was buried much deeper by the volcano than Pompeii, more than 20 metres in some areas, so the first explorations of the site were carried out by tunnelling through the hardened ash. Pompeii, on the other hand, was only buried by about 4 metres of ash in some places. This meant that in the months following the eruption people returned to the city to salvage statues, building materials and whatever else they could find. However, it also meant that when Pompeii was rediscovered in 1748, it was possible to excavate large areas relatively easily. Visitors preferred to wander the open-air streets, houses and public buildings of Pompeii, than clamber down dangerous tunnels in Herculaneum. So although many of the most impressive discoveries, such as the bronze and marble statues from the Villa of the Papyri, were made in Herculaneum, it was Pompeii that attracted the tourists. As Pompeii became the focus of the excavations of the Bourbon kings of Naples, the tunnels of Herculaneum were filled in and interest in the site waned until open-air excavations began years later. The creation of plaster casts of the victims of Pompeii by Giuseppe Fiorelli in the 1860s sealed its fate as the city which set imaginations alight.\nHerculaneum was also the first of the two cities to be destroyed in AD 79. The initial surge of superheated ash, rock and gas, following the collapse of the 20 mile high cloud ejected by Mount Vesuvius, raced towards Herculaneum and wiped it out in an instant. The temperature during the eruption is could have reached 450\u00b0C in Herculaneum, which meant that organic material, like wood and foodstuffs, were preserved. At these temperatures, and encased in volcanic material which rapidly compacted and hardened to rock, wood did not burn, but was instantly carbonised \u2013 turned to charcoal. At Pompeii, where temperatures may only have reached a cooler 350\u00b0C, organic material has very rarely survived. It is Herculaneum that has yielded the furniture, the straw baskets and the loaves of bread.\nCarbonised furniture and food (Photo: \u00a9 Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Napoli e Pompei.)\nThe archaeological site open to visitors today presents a striking scene: lying metres below the current ground level, with the modern town of Ercolano perching above it and Vesuvius still looming in the background. There are two-storey buildings, wooden doors, staircases and even racks holding amphorae, still in situ. Once an ordinary city of the Roman empire, its destruction and preservation have made it an extraordinary place which truly deserves the same renown as its counterpart."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/telling-the-human-story-of-pompeii-and-herculaneum/", "category": "Curator's corner", "title": "Telling the human story of Pompeii and Herculaneum", "author": "Vanessa Baldwin, Exhibition Project Curator, Life and death in Pompeii and Herculaneum", "timestamp": "2013-03-28 00:00:00", "text": "Many of the objects on display in the exhibition Life and death in Pompeii and Herculaneum, were not artefacts, they were\u00a0people\u2019s possessions.

Even though height is generally determined by our genes, whether we fulfil our genetic potential depends on our state of health and nutrition during growth. At Amara West, females reached body heights of 154 cm on average, while men reached 166 cm.\nIn comparison, mean statures in the UK today are 175 cm for men, and 162 cm for women, according to a study published in 2002.\nAnother interesting finding in the human remains from Amara West so far is the high degree of fractures, particularly in the upper body. These injuries are usually associated with falls or crashes. But what happened to these people? The distribution of injuries is remarkably similar to what is observed with people involved in agricultural activities even today, especially those who regularly handle animals.\nFind out more about the Amara West research project."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/murder-and-mayhem-in-predynastic-egypt/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Murder and mayhem in Predynastic Egypt", "author": "Daniel Antoine, Curator of Physical Anthropology and Ren\u00e9e Friedman, Curator, Ancient Egypt and Sudan", "timestamp": "2012-12-06 00:00:00", "text": "The ability to determine the cause of death in ancient remains is rare enough, but because his skin and muscle tissue are so well preserved, further detective work has allowed us to trace the trajectory (from above) and estimate the size (about two centimetres across, maximum) of the implement responsible.\nBased on this information, the murder weapon was most probably a dagger.\nWhile a projectile point is also a possibility, it is unlikely that it could have been removed without causing further tissue damage, and the cut on his skin is not lacerated. Only if it were a broad-edged transverse arrowhead, like those carried by the men on the Hunters\u2019 Palette, might this be possible.\nArrows, as shown on the Hunters\u2019 Palette.\nWhile this type of arrowhead was common in Predynastic Egypt, it was rarely made in a size matching the wound in Gebelein Man\u2019s left shoulder.\nComposite image of a Predynastic silver dagger\nblade and ivory handle.\nWe can probably also rule out flint knives, although they were prevalent throughout the Predynastic period (3800-3100 BC), with various examples displayed in the British Museum\u2019s Room 64: Early Egypt gallery.\nFrom their shape it is clear that they were mainly for cutting and slashing, using their edge rather than their point to inflict wounds. Most are also too wide to fit the forensic evidence from Gebelein Man. Instead, it seems most likely that he was done in by a metal blade.\nTools and weapons of metal (mainly copper but also silver) are rare in Predynastic Egypt mainly because implements of such valuable materials would have been recycled rather than discarded by the living and were among the first things to be robbed from the dead. Nevertheless, there can be little doubt that copper was widely used at this time. For example, the central ridge depicted on the lances carried on the Hunters Palette (slightly later in date than Gebelein Man) indicate they were made of metal.\nSix dagger blades of copper and silver have been preserved. Some still have their ivory handles, while all have a triangular blade with a mid-rib down the centre, and are 15-16.5 cm long with a maximum width of four-five cm. These blades are so far the best fit for the weapon used against Gebelein Man, and the two cm cut at the rib level suggest such a blade was plunged into his back for most of its length. The composite example shown here gives an idea of the original appearance, and evidence from one Predynastic cemetery suggests they were worn interlaced through armlets on the left upper arm for easy and rapid access.\nWe will never find the perpetrator responsible for Gebelein Man\u2019s death, or determine his motives (revenge?, a hunting accident?, an act on the battlefield?), but the iconography and artefacts of Predynastic Egypt suggest it was not always a peaceful place.\nStone maces and metal lances on the Hunters\u2019 Palette.\nAlready 200-300 years before Gebelein Man met his end, scenes on pottery show human prisoners threatened with stone maces. Mace-heads of hard stone are well-known throughout the period. While they were probably used mainly in hunting, that they were also used against humans is clear from excavations in a cemetery at Hierakonpolis, contemporary with Gebelein Man, where several individuals suffered massive and fatal skull fractures inflicted by such an instrument. Further defensive wounds suggest these injuries were attained in battle.\nStone mace-head, red breccia. First dynasty.\nThese may have been minor skirmishes, but shortly after Gebelein Man died, scenes depicting pitched battles begin to appear.\nWhile Gebelein Man may simply have been the unfortunate victim of interpersonal violence, he lived in a time when several regional centres in Upper Egypt, Gebelein being one of them, were beginning to vie for power and territory, in a process that ultimately led to the so-called unification of Egypt and the establishment of the Dynastic Egyptian nation state at about 3100 BC. Diplomacy may have been influential in this process, but there is no doubt that violence also played a major role, as the scene on the Battlefield Palette (about 3200 BC) leaves little to the imagination.\nWas Gebelein Man a victim of his times? Recent research, suggesting that he was buried in a large well-endowed grave and with a number of lethal weapons of his own, only adds to the mystery that now surrounds him.\nVirtual autopsy: explore a natural mummy from early Egypt is on display in Room 64 until 3 March 2013."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/virtual-autopsy-discover-how-the-ancient-egyptian-gebelein-man-died/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Virtual autopsy: discover how the ancient Egyptian Gebelein Man died", "author": "Daniel Antoine, Curator of Physical Anthropology", "timestamp": "2012-11-16 00:00:00", "text": "In recent months the naturally-preserved mummy known as Gebelein Man (on display in Room 64, the Early Egypt gallery at the British Museum) has been revealing some of his long-held secrets.\nGebelein Man, Predynastic period, around 3500 BC, Gebelein, Egypt, British Museum\u00a0EA32751\u00a0(Photo: (c) The Trustees of the British Museum)\nHe was buried in about 3500 BC (if not earlier) at the site of Gebelein in Upper Egypt.

So naturally, I was eager to explore whether the collision of the Egyptian and Roman worlds apparent in this very unique statue of Horus, was also reflected in the materials, in particular the pigments, used to create it.\nI started by carefully documenting the location of the pigment remains (by taking images using different types of light) and then taking microscopic samples for investigation using Raman and FTIR Spectroscopy.\nDetailed images of traces of polychromy on the statue.\nFrom these studies it was found that the red used was a hematite-containing red earth \u2013 or ochre \u2013 the yellow, a yellow ochre, and the black used was amorphous carbon. All of these are pigments which are typical of a palette strictly within well-defined Egyptian traditions. The real cross-cultural nature of the piece came upon analysis of the green pigment used on the cloak and sword blade, which revealed the use of green earth (celadonite), a pigment virtually unknown in dynastic Egypt but one of the most common green pigments found in Roman art. The discovery demonstrates that the object was truly blending traditions not only at the iconographical level but also its very fabric.\nBut our Horus held still more secrets. Conspicuous by its absence so far in this investigation was a pigment that is inextricably linked with the Egyptian palette \u2013 Egyptian blue, virtually the only blue pigment used in ancient Egypt.\nEgyptian blue is a calcium copper tetrasilicate (CaCuSi4O10) that has the same composition and structure as the rare natural mineral cuprorivaite, and is one of the earliest-known synthetic pigments. This bright blue inorganic compound was extensively used and highly-prized not only in Egypt, where it was used from the Fourth Dynasty (about 2500 BC), but throughout the Mediterranean until the end of the Roman period in Europe. In addition, this pigment has a very particular property: it is one of a very few materials which luminesce (emit light) in the infrared range when excited by visible light. This emission can be recorded by using a camera with some sensitivity to infrared radiation in the circa 800\u20131000 nm range.\nWe used such a camera to investigate if any Egyptian blue was present on Horus as often, even when no blue seems to survive, the visible-induced luminescence technique (VIL as it is known) is sensitive enough to detect even single particles of the pigment. And we found considerably more than one particle!\nLeft: Visible-reflected image. Right: Visible-induced luminescence image in the infrared range (800\u20131000 nm) of the front of Horus. Bright white areas correspond to the presence of Egyptian blue.\nThe pictures above show our results compared with the appearance of the sculpture in visible light. The areas of \u2018bright white\u2019 in the monochrome VIL image represent the emission from Egyptian blue while all other materials appear grey or dark. Comparing the images allows the spatial distribution of surviving Egyptian blue pigment to be mapped and it is clear that its presence is very extensive even though hardly anything was discernible with the naked eye. Traces can be seen around the outer rim of the eyes and possibly within the proper left eyeball, as well as in the folds of the cloak worn across the shoulders. Perhaps more dramatically, remnants are also evident on many of the feathers around the lower throat and ears and the feathers or scales which make up the armour.\nWith this last piece of the puzzle in place it was time to ask ourselves the inevitable question: what might our Horus have looked like? Our imaging and analytical results were used as a basis to create computer-enhanced images suggesting how the sculpture might originally have looked. And here he is: meet the Egyptian god Horus in Roman military costume, both Roman and Egyptian even in how he was made.\nA computer enhanced version of Horus re-coloured to suggest its original appearance. Colour has only been applied to those areas where analysis and imaging provided strong evidence for pigments. Areas which have been restored or where there was no analytical evidence for colour are shown as grey.\nFor more on the technical imaging and analytical examination of this object see Analysis of pigment traces on a limestone sculpture of the Egyptian god Horus in Roman military costume (pdf).\nThe sculpture of Horus will be on display until 10 December 2012, in Room 4."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/pigment-and-power-dressing-in-roman-egypt/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "Pigment and power dressing in Roman Egypt", "author": "Elisabeth R.

From the waist down, he could be any of a number of senior Olympian deities, or Roman emperors masquerading as such. He wears a feathered mail armour shirt that ends just above his elbows. His arms, now broken off, would have held symbols of power, perhaps an orb and sceptre. His cloak, pushed back over his shoulders, is fastened with a circular broach. From the waist up, his costume belongs to military deities and, especially, Roman emperors, who were also worshipped in temples dedicated to them throughout the empire.

(Photo: (c) The Trustees of the British Museum)\nIt\u2019s Horus, the sun god and divine representative of the living king in ancient Egyptian tradition. His head is that of a falcon, rendered in naturalistic style with the bird\u2019s distinctive facial markings articulated by the carving and also traces of paint. His eyes, however, are strangely human; instead of being placed on the sides of the head, like any \u2018real\u2019 bird, they are frontal, and his incised pupils tilt his gaze upward. In an imaginative turn, the feathers of the falcon\u2019s neck blend into the scales of the mail shirt. In the top of his head is a hole, into which a (probably metal) crown once fit.\nBig Bird, as I think of him, has been off public display since 1996 when the gallery he was formerly displayed in was reconfigured to create the Great Court. Since I arrived at the Museum in 2007, he\u2019s been the culmination of my tours for university students, giving us the opportunity to explore cultural identity through different kinds of objects from Roman Egypt. We look at magical papyri written in Egyptian and Greek, with some of the Egyptian words written in Old Coptic, that is, the Egyptian language written in Greek script. Why the glosses of Egyptian words in Greek script? Because in magical spells it was very important to say the words correctly or else the spell wouldn\u2019t work. And Greek script, unlike Egyptian, represented the vowels ensuring that the words said aloud were accurately pronounced at a time when literacy in Egyptian scripts was on the wane. We also look at mummy portraits belonging firmly in the Roman tradition of individualised commemorative portraiture, but made for the specific purpose of placing over the face of a mummy, a feature that belongs unmistakably to Egyptian funerary practice. We see the same combination of traditions in this limestone sculpture of Horus and other contemporary depictions.\nThe opportunity to get the sculpture on public display arose last year when the Gayer-Anderson cat was scheduled to travel to Paris, then Shetland, for exhibition. Big Bird would get his very own case at the top of a ramp, amid other sculpture more readily identifiable as \u2018Egyptian\u2019 in the British Museum Egyptian Sculpture Gallery.\nWhile preparing the display, we also had a chance to identify some of the pigments that are apparent to the naked eye: his yellow arms, black pupils and \u2018eye-liner,\u2019 garments in two different shades of green, and his red and black throne. Using an innovative imaging technique, we were also able to detect the pigment used for his armour, and it turned out to be one of the most valued pigments of the ancient world, Egyptian blue.\nThe image on the right was taken with an infrared camera. The bright white areas show where traces of \u2018Egyptian blue\u2019 pigment survive.

For example, from Pompeii, the large industrial centre of the region with a population of around 12-15,000, comes a statue of a woman commemorating her funding \u2013 with her own money \u2013 of the largest building in the forum, the heart of the city. This, in a male-dominated society where women might not usually be known as the rich patrons of civic monuments.\nWhile at the same time, the more mundane elements of life are revealed in objects such as an extraordinarily well-preserved loaf of bread that, in Paul\u2019s words, \u2018went in the oven in AD 79 and came out in the 1930s\u2019.\nBut of course the reason we know this story and can see these wonderful objects is because of the tragedy which struck in AD 79. Incredible finds from Herculaneum, a smaller seaside town of some 4-5,000 inhabitants, include food, leather, and wooden furniture \u2013 from a table to a baby\u2019s cot \u2013 and survive only because they were carbonised (turned into charcoal) by the 4-500 degree Celsius volcanic avalanche that engulfed the city.\nAs Paul explained:\n\u2018We can\u2019t imagine the horror of that day, but we can see what people did. Some of them were practical, taking a lantern or a lamp to help them stumble through the total darkness of the volcanic blizzard. Other people took gold and silver in the form of coins or jewellery. One little girl took her charm bracelet with pieces from all over the Roman world and beyond, such as cowries from the Indian Ocean, amber from the Baltic, rock crystal from the Alps, faience from Egypt. She had this with her when she died on the beach at Herculaneum with hundreds of others.\u2019\nSome 2,000 years later that charm bracelet will be among the objects on display at the British Museum next year, allowing us as it does to recall and remember the real people whose lives we are so privileged to be able to see and understand:\u2018We had to have the death of Pompeii and Herculaneum to know so much about the people who lived there, but it\u2019s their lives that we will be celebrating in this exhibition.\u2019"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/horses-and-human-history/", "category": "Exhibitions and events", "title": "Horses and human history", "author": "Nigel Tallis, Exhibition Curator,The horse: from Arabia to Royal Ascot", "timestamp": "2012-05-22 00:00:00", "text": "For 5,000 years the horse has been an ever-present ally in war and peace.

Typically, a witch was somebody who lived quite nearby and whom you had encountered. And typically that witch had a grievance. It wasn\u2019t motiveless malignity, there was thought to be some good reason why the witch wanted to do you or your household harm.\nAlthough there were lots of grievances, the most typical one was that the witch had come to the door begging for food or asking to borrow some household utensil and was turned away from the door and the next day the little child in the house fell ill or the wife was taken ill or somebody died. And, in my view, it was really the guilty conscience of the householder that led to the accusation because in those days borrowing and lending was an acknowledged neighbourly duty.\nWhy is it that witches were predominantly women? I think there is a combination of reasons for this. The first and perhaps most important reason is that old women, widows, were the most dependent members of the community. They are the ones whose names figure most frequently on the lists of people in receipt of poor relief, and they were the ones most likely to be caught up in this situation of begging for help and not getting it. But on top of that there was undoubtedly a feeling that women embodied some curious supernatural dimension. For example, the effects produced by a witch were more or less the same as those which were popularly attributed to a menstruating woman. When a woman was menstruating it was said \u2013 and this was even in the case in my boyhood, I grew up on a farm \u2013 that they shouldn\u2019t come near the dairy because the butter wouldn\u2019t set and that if they looked at a mirror they\u2019d tarnish it.\nIn the later 17th century, the belief that old women could harm others supernaturally was beginning to wane among the educated clergy, gentry and academics in universities. At that stage there were those who felt that the belief in the existence and possibility of witchcraft was integral to establish religion because if you said there were no evil spirits at work, you were really denying some primary tenets of Christianity. You were saying effectively that there was no devil or that the devil had no physical powers, and by saying that you were suggesting that God couldn\u2019t intervene in the world either. So a lot of people tried to prop up orthodox religion by reasserting the reality of witchcraft and investigating cases and publishing information about it and so on, to reassure people that the world really was a place where a great contest between good and evil spirits was occurring.\nShakespeare\u2019s Restless World is on BBC Radio 4\nfrom 16 April to 11 May, at 13.45 and 19.45 weekdays.\n\nListen to today\u2019s programme Toil and Trouble\nFind out more:\nReligion and the Decline of Magic by Keith Thomas"}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/finishing-a-3d-2000-year-old-roman-jigsaw-puzzle-the-hallaton-helmet-unveiled/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "Finishing a 3D, 2,000 year-old Roman jigsaw puzzle: the Hallaton helmet unveiled", "author": "JD Hill, Research Manager", "timestamp": "2012-01-10 00:00:00", "text": "This morning a rare and extraordinary Roman helmet was shown in public for the first time since it was buried 2,000 years ago.

That\u2019s almost 10 percent of all known surviving British Iron Age coins \u2013 and the largest number of Iron Age coins ever excavated in Britain \u2013 found at this one site.\nMost of the hoards included Iron Age silver coins, as well as a small number of Iron Age gold and Roman silver coins\nAdd to that, evidence suggestive of ritual feasting dating back to the first century AD and the significance of this discovery really begins to emerge.\nCollectively these finds became known as the Hallaton Treasure and were acquired by Leicestershire County Council with help from a large number of funding bodies, organisations and institutions.\nBut why was it buried in east Leicestershire (very likely by the hands of native Britons)? The answer is; we just don\u2019t know. But there are a number of theories.\nPerhaps it was actually owned by an important local man who served in the Roman cavalry before or during the Roman conquest. He might have chosen to bury his highly-prized helmet at his local shrine as a gift to the gods on his return home.\nOr, perhaps it was a diplomatic gift to a supportive local population. It has also been suggested that it was spoil of war, or captured during a battle or a raid.\nBritish Museum conservator, Marilyn Hockey with the helmet\nWe may never know for sure why this amazing collection of objects ended up buried in the east Midlands, but it certainly speaks of a fascinating moment in the history of this part of the world and, in its current state, the skill and dedication of conservators, scientists, archaeologists and curators here at the British Museum and in Leicestershire.\nAs for the helmet, if you ask me it will become a new iconic object of the Roman conquest. Future books and TV programmes about this momentous event will have to feature it. That\u2019s the sort of key find this is."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/a-conservator-says-goodbye-to-china/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "A conservator says goodbye to China", "author": "Valentina Marabini, Conservator", "timestamp": "2012-01-05 00:00:00", "text": "After a year in China studying with the conservators at the Shanghai Museum, I arrived back in London in mid-December to start putting into practice at the British Museum the many new skills and techniques I learned.\nExamining a painting in the studio\nIn the last few months of my placement, I undertook a number of projects and had the opportunity to speak about my work at some international events.\nOne such event was the Forum for Curators of Chinese Art at the Seattle Art Museum in the USA, 27-29 July organised by the JS Lee Foundation. Curators, scientists, archeologists and conservators from both western and eastern museums came together to present, discuss and share their work and I was invited to speak about my time studying the conservation of Chinese heritage paintings in the conservation studio at Shanghai Museum.\nIn October I gave an introduction to the techniques I used in two conservation cases at the Fine Art Department of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. This gave me the chance to visit the Hong Kong Museum of Art, where I was able to meet fellow conservators and discuss examples from their collections and conservation challenges and methods with them.\nThe Palace Museum, Taipei, Taiwan\nI then went on to the National Palace Museum of Taipei, where I was given the honour of seeing some of their great masterpieces. The Head of Conservation, Mr Hung Sun Xin, allowed me to spend some time at their conservation facility and talked with me about materials and methods they use.\nFinally, a visit to the Palace Museum in Beijing concluded my time in China.

Dot Boughton, Finds Liaison Officer (FLO) for Lancashire and Cumbria, is probably beginning to feel that the same rule applies to Viking silver hoards. It was only in April of this year that a hoard of over 90 coins and hacksilver from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria was reported to Dot. For any FLO, and indeed for the British Museum, which provides expert advice to enable the coroner to hold an inquest into the case (as required under the Treasure Act 1996), this represented a lot of material to work on. Not since the discovery of the Vale of York hoard almost five years ago had so many Viking-age artefacts and coins from one find been reported as Treasure.\nBut no sooner had the coroner concluded his inquest into the Barrow case than Dot was on the phone to our office again with news of an even larger hoard.\nA piece of jewellery from the Silverdale Viking hoard\nWhen the finder\u2019s photographs were sent through to us, we knew this new hoard from Silverdale in Lancashire, was going to be one of the major enterprises of the year for us and our colleagues. Silver arm-rings, brooch fragments, ingots and coins had all (bar one coin) been found in, or underneath, a lead container. Barry Ager (Department of Prehistory and Europe) and Dr Gareth Williams (Department of Coins and Medals), were duly warned of the arrival of this material and they cleared their schedules.\nAfter a furious few months spent weighing, analyzing, cataloguing and photographing the finds, the report for the coroner was ready.\nAmong the many stand-out objects is a coin type none of us had seen before. One side of it reads DNS (Dominus) REX, the letters arranged in the form of a cross (many Vikings had converted to Christianity within a generation of settling in Britain). On the other side, the inscription reads AIRDECONUT which appears to be an attempt to represent the Scandinavian name Harthacnut, a ruler not previously known.\nA previously unrecorded coin type, probably carrying the name of an otherwise unknown Viking ruler in northern England\nThe local museum, Lancaster City Museum, had earlier been informed of the find and as they expressed an interest in acquiring the hoard through the Treasure process, Mr Simon Jones, HM Deputy Coroner for Preston and West Lancashire has been asked to hold an inquest into the case. The inquest will be held on Friday the 16 December 2011, and we will find out whether it is \u2018Treasure\u2019 according to the criteria set out in the Treasure Act 1996.\nThe finder and his wife obligingly accepted our invitation to attend the launch of the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) and Treasure Act Annual Reports, held at the British Museum today where they have been able to join us in showing the hoard to Ed Vaizey, Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries.\nThe Silverdale Hoard\nGoing forward, it is of course our sincere hope that Lancaster City Museum will be able to acquire the Silverdale hoard for its collection. If the coroner declares it \u2018Treasure\u2019, the next step is to have it valued by the independent Treasure Valuation Committee (TVC) who would recommend a market value for the hoard. The museum may very well engage in a fundraising campaign to acquire the hoard, and if they do so we\u2019ll offer our full support."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/what-is-the-role-and-value-of-crafts-today/", "category": "Museum stories", "title": "What is the role and value of crafts today?", "author": "Teleri Lloyd-Jones", "timestamp": "2011-08-17 00:00:00", "text": "\u00a31 billion a year. That\u2019s the simple answer, the total annual turnover of contemporary craftspeople in this country. Now that\u2019s a big number, but of course craft is a lot more valuable than that.\n\nUnderstanding how something is made, why it\u2019s made that way, is more vital to modern life than ever. Craft is a language of material, provenance and making. It is learning the value of things. Sure, handmade, well-made things aren\u2019t cheap but their value isn\u2019t solely monetary. It\u2019s political and social \u2013 to know how and where something came into being makes us more invested in it, so much so we become more responsible consumers. The handmade has unique aesthetic pleasures in itself but has also become intertwined with a whole bundle of different values, be they anti-consumerist, \u2018localist\u2019, green, or even just plain-old fashionable.\nAs soon as we widen our gaze beyond the shop or the gallery, we see craft appearing in the most unanticipated places. Take for example the recent trachea transplant, a world first. It was made possible not only by the dexterity of the hands of a surgeon but also the glass artist Matt Durran who made the mould on which to grow the transplant scaffold. Last year, an orthopaedic surgeon from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital placed his junior as a carpenter\u2019s apprentice recognising the similarities in their practices: the tooling, teamworking and problem-solving. These skills are cross-disciplinary, neither art nor science, but always hard-won and always valuable.\nSo perhaps part of craft\u2019s value is locked up in its confusion, the discussions to be had at its fuzzy edges. A surgeon may have similar needle-and-thread skills at their fingertips to a hobbyist and yet their contexts couldn\u2019t be more different. We can all agree that a potter sat at a wheel has craft skills but what about a hairdresser, or a lab technician? In fact, is it possible to have a craftsperson who doesn\u2019t use their hands at all to make things? Is burgeoning digital technology, like 3d printing, just another tool in the toolbox or is it a game-changer?\nWhat a country makes is part of its fabric, its identity. Such importance has recently been recognised politically by the government\u2019s launch of \u2018Made by Britain\u2019 a celebration of domestic manufacturing and ingenuity. And a quick flick back to George Osborne\u2019s last budget and we can read about his \u2018Britain held aloft by the march of the makers\u2019. Even though the vast majority of our economy is not built on making things, still the cultural drive to make has intense political currency, it tugs at our heartstrings. What\u2019s important here is nurturing and educating those who think with their hands, ensuring young people can discover their own talents and retain skills for a new generation.\nAs the skills and material knowledge central to craft continue to have great value it is the role itself that changes. Technologies advance at break-neck speeds and the public\u2019s desire for authenticity grows making the role of the crafts crucial for modern life. Whether traditional or innovative, art or science, on show in a gallery window or hidden away in unexpected places, making has the power to deeply satisfy. And all it needs from us is a little patience and appreciation."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/newly-acquired-cycladic-figurine-goes-on-display/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "Newly-acquired Cycladic figurine goes on display", "author": "Lesley Fitton, Honorary Research Fellow", "timestamp": "2011-07-05 00:00:00", "text": "The Cycladic Gallery (Room 11) at the British Museum now has a new addition \u2013 an extremely rare marble figurine of the \u2018hunter-warrior\u2019 type.\nHe is the first male figurine to be added to the collection, and so is vastly outnumbered by the female figurines surrounding him, but he looks lovely and very much at home in his new surroundings.

They are defined by the presence of a shoulder-strap (baldric) and a belt, and some are also shown with a dagger. This one has no dagger, but we have decided to display him next to an actual dagger of the same period. He is also near to a female figurine of the late, Chalandriani variety, so it\u2019s possible to see how he fits towards the end of the sequence of production. He was made in the Cyclades (the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea) around 2300-2200 BC.\nMale Cycladic figurines are rare, but \u2018hunter-warriors\u2019 are more rare still \u2013 in fact, only three other relatively well-preserved examples are known worldwide. We had scarcely expected to be able to make such a significant acquisition, but this piece comes with a good history that adds to its fascination. It belonged to the abstract-expressionist artist Wolfgang Paalen, who lived in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s.\nMarble Cycladic figurine of the \u2018hunter-warrior\u2019 type Made in the Cyclades, Greece, about 2300\u20132200 BC\nInterest in early creations such as Cycladic figurines, along with excitement about the arts of Africa, pre-Columbian South America and Polynesia, were characteristic of artistic circles in Paris at this time. In the mid-1930s Paalen produced what he called his \u2018Cycladic paintings\u2019. The influence of objects such as this figurine is very apparent in these works and we have included a small image of one of them in the display.\nWe would hope in the future to borrow a Paalen \u2018Cycladic\u2019 painting to show alongside the wonderful new figurine, which contributes so significantly to both an ancient Cycladic and a modern Parisian story."}, {"link": "https://blog.britishmuseum.org/what-is-a-book-of-the-dead/", "category": "Objects in focus", "title": "What is a Book of the Dead?", "author": "John Taylor, Curator, Ancient Egypt and Sudan", "timestamp": "2010-09-22 00:00:00", "text": "The \u2018Journey through the afterlife: ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead\u2018\u00a0exhibition was\u00a0the result of years of work behind the scenes in planning, preparation and research. It was exciting to be able to focus on these special documents and to have the rare opportunity to display such a variety of them.\n\u2018Book of the Dead\u2019 is a modern term for a collection of magical spells that the Egyptians used to help them get into the afterlife. They imagined the afterlife as a kind of journey you had to make to get to paradise \u2013 but it was quite a hazardous journey so you\u2019d need magical help along the way.\nThe Book of the Dead isn\u2019t a finite text \u2013 it\u2019s not like the Bible, it\u2019s not a collection of doctrine or a statement of faith or anything like that \u2013 it\u2019s a practical guide to the next world, with spells that would help you on your journey.\nThe \u2018book\u2019 is usually a roll of papyrus with lots and lots of spells written on it in hieroglyphic script. They usually have beautiful coloured illustrations as well. They would have been quite expensive so only wealthy, high-status people would have had them. Depending on how rich you were, you could either go along and buy a ready-made papyrus which would have blank spaces for your name to be written in, or you could spend a bit more and probably choose which spells you wanted.\nSome of the spells are to make sure you can control your own body after death. The ancient Egyptians believed that a person was made up of different elements: body, spirit, name, heart, they\u2019re all embodiments of a person, and they were afraid that these elements would disperse when you died. So there are a lot of spells to make sure you don\u2019t lose your head or your heart, that your body doesn\u2019t decay, as well as other spells about keeping alive by breathing air, having water to drink, having food to eat.\nThere are also spells about protecting yourself because the ancient Egyptians expected to be attacked on the journey to the afterlife by snakes, crocodiles, insects \u2013 an idea very much based on the threats they knew in real life only much more frightening and much more dangerous.\nAs well as the animals, you could be attacked by gods or demons who served the gods. In the next world there are a lot of gods who are guarding gateways that you have to get through, and if you don\u2019t give the right answers to their questions at the gates, they can attack you because they have knives and snakes in their hands.\nWithout the correct spells to protect you, you could be punished in a variety of ways: you could be put on to the slaughter block, you could be decapitated, or you could be turned upside down (which meant your digestive process worked in reverse so you had to eat faeces and drink urine forever!)\nThe worst thing that could\u00a0happen was\u00a0what was\u00a0called the second death. This meant you were killed and your spirit couldn\u2019t come back and so you would have no afterlife at all.\nIt was a world of great fear that they believed they were going into, and the Book of the Dead provided guidance and protection on this journey."}]
